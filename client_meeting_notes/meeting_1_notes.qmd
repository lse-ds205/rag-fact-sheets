# Client Meeting 1 Summary
**Date:** 29/04/2025  
**Participants:** Group 4 x Sylvan Lutz

# 1. Infrastructure Walkthrough

## 1.1 Rui Kai Infrastructure Overview
- Presentation of the initial project infrastructure setup.

## 1.2 Group Explanation
- **Data Retrieval**:  
  - Scraping and processing of necessary metadata as the first stage.
- **Answer Generation**:  
  - Retrieving top-matching embeddings.
  - Utilizing LLM APIs to generate accurate outputs for the client.

## 1.3 Client Response
- **Addressing Chunk Pass-Through**:
  - Emphasis on strong pre-processing to ensure higher model accuracy.
  - Better pre-processing reduces the need for overly complex models:
    - Absorbing unnecessary chunks can hurt output quality.
    - Optimizing chunk length simplifies final model behavior.

## 1.4 Conclusion
- Alignment between the client and the group on infrastructure design and priorities.

# 2. Front-End Integration Proposal

## 2.1 Group Comments
- Proposal to explore a user-friendly front-end once the core backend infrastructure is functional.

## 2.2 Client Comments
- Focus should remain on the backend for now:
  - **Robust code** to handle updates to incoming files.
  - Clear **separation of concerns** in code structure.
  - **Modularized code** to ensure ease of maintenance and extensibility.

# 3. Evaluation Criteria for the Model

## 3.1 Group Questions
- **Key evaluation objectives**:
  - Reduce human intervention.
  - Design a future-proof system.
  - Efficient data processing (lower priority).
  - Ensure **correctness** in:
    - Data structure.
    - Data consistency.
- **Additional queries**:
  - What accuracy metrics are being used?
  - What is the expected format and appearance of the model output for the client?

## 3.2 Client Commentary on TPI Objectives
- **Scraping Concerns**:
  - Need for a sustainable, large-scale scraping approach.
  - Addressing challenges with countries uploading documents late against internal deadlines.
- **Lag of Information**:
  - The climate space suffers from a data availability lag affecting decision-making.
  - We must reduce the time between information becoming available and being usable.
- **Standardization of Data Output**:
  - Standardizing how countries present data is crucial.

## 3.3 Suggestions for the Retrieve/Output Phase
- Develop **structured pipelines** tailored for different information types.
- Identify whether the output:
  - Can be handled by an LLM.
  - Requires human verification during post-processing.
- **Client Suggestion**:
  - Think of the LLM acting as a **classifier** in the pipeline.
- **Key Output Focus**:
  - Prioritize producing **consistent** outputs.
  - Initially answer **one or two questions extremely well** before scaling complexity.

# 4. Next Steps

- **Update 1**: Development of the scraping and data processing pipeline.
- **Update 2**: Focus on delivering consistent, narrow-bodied answers to maintain quality.
