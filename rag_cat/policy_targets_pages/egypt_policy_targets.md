- **Year(s)**: 2022, 2023, 2050

- **Confidence**: 0.8194

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8250): Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found here**. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNF


## Sector Targets

- **Answer**: `yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions sector-specific targets. (Note: negation present in sentence, which may weaken the claim.)

- **Year(s)**: 2015, 2030

- **Sector(s)**: Electricity, Transport

- **Confidence**: 0.8185

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/egypt/targets/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8243): The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egyptâ€™s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 a


## Efficiency Target

- **Answer**: `soft_yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions energy efficiency themes, but no clear policy or target.

- **Year(s)**: 2019, 2021, 2022

- **Sector(s)**: Energy

- **Confidence**: 0.8137

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/egypt/policies-action/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8156): The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021). Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks amon


## Electricity Net Zero

- **Answer**: `no`

- **Explanation**: None

- **Year(s)**: 2022, 2023, 2050

- **Confidence**: 0.8223

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/egypt/targets/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8306): Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found here**. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNF


## Carbon Pricing

- **Answer**: `no`

- **Explanation**: None

- **Confidence**: 0.7927

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/egypt/governance/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7956): Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms. **Mainstreaming the concept of
