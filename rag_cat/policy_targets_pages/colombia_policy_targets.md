# Policy Targets for Colombia


## Net Zero Target

- **Answer**: `yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions net zero target.

- **Confidence**: 0.7982

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/colombia/targets/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8077): CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to required domestic efforts, and "Almost sufficient” compared to Colombia’s fair share. Colombia has a net zero target and has submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. Both the NDC and net zero targets 


## Sector Targets

- **Answer**: `yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions sector-specific targets.

- **Year(s)**: 2020, 2050

- **Sector(s)**: Industrial

- **Confidence**: 0.8247

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/colombia/policies-action/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8334): The CAT indicates that to be compatible with the 1.5°C limit, cement production needs to reduce its emissions intensity to zero by 2050, (Climate Action Tracker, 2020). The cement sector in Colombia is still far from this zero-emissions trajectory. No target is 


## Efficiency Target

- **Answer**: `soft_yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions energy efficiency themes, but no clear policy or target. (Note: negation present in sentence, which may weaken the claim.)

- **Year(s)**: 2018, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050

- **Sector(s)**: Electricity, Energy, Industry, Power

- **Confidence**: 0.8141

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/colombia/policies-action/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8060): The rest of the planned 11.2 MtCO2e energy sector mitigation target for 2030 is to be made up through increased energy efficiency in buildings and industry, reducing fugitive emissions from power plants and reducing overall energy demand (Gobierno de Colombia, 2


## Electricity Net Zero

- **Answer**: `yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions net zero electricity or decarbonised power sector. (Note: negation present in sentence, which may weaken the claim.)

- **Year(s)**: 2030, 2040, 2050

- **Sector(s)**: Power

- **Confidence**: 0.8339

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/colombia/policies-action/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8210): While this is a step in the right direction, it is likely not fast enough to be 1.5°C compatible, as global benchmarks indicate that national power sectors would need to be decarbonised by 2030, with a coal phase-out by 2040 for developing countries. A stronger 


## Carbon Pricing

- **Answer**: `no`

- **Explanation**: None

- **Year(s)**: 2021

- **Confidence**: 0.7953

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/colombia/targets/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7964): In December 2021, with the Law No. 2169 (Ley Climatica N°2169, 2021), Colombia promotes the country's low-carbon development through the establishment of minimum targets and measures for carbon neutrality and climate resilience. This enriches the carbon neutrali
