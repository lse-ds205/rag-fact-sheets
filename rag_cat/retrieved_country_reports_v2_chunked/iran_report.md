### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8297):**
> **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   As of October 2023, Iran does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8383):**
> For the agriculture and waste sector, which are traditionally less impacted by the economic sanctions and overall economic landscape, we just apply 5-year historical trend from 2017-2021. For the emissions in the agriculture and waste sector, we apply a five-year trend based on historical data for 2017-2021. For the energy and industry sector emissions, the projections are based on the historical trends of GDP elasticity of the sectors’ GHG emissions combined with GDP growth estimates from IMF (IMF, 2023) .

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8017):**
> Analysis shows that energy consumption could be reduced by 40% compared to BAU estimates in 2030 with energy efficiency measures alone, which would also lead to significant emissions reductions (Moshiri & Lechtenböhmer, 2015). Emissions could further decrease with the deployment of renewable energy and other cost-effective mitigation measures (Yetano Roche et al., 2018). Iran’s capacity to address climate change has been hindered by enduring economic sanctions.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7971):**
> There is however no clear timeline nor implementation plan for these measures. With the rapid development of electric vehicles, the strategy to move to CNG is outdated. The aging fleet of private vehicles is further adding to the carbon intensity of the transport sector (Financial Tribune, 2018).
