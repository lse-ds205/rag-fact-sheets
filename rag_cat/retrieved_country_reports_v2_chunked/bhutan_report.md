## Country: Bhutan

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7978):**
> **Analysis of earlier NDC developments**   - 24 June 2021 “Bhutan submits a second NDC”   ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   Bhutan has set an indicative goal of reaching net zero by 2050 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). Bhutan first committed to remain carbon neutral during COP15 in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 target, which it has already met given it is currently a net negative emitter.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8224):**
> By contrast, government data reports an 18% drop in emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2020 – which is more consistent with the economic slowdown the country experienced. As the economy continued to contract in 2021, we would expect emissions to fall as well. 2021-2022 historical emissions estimateEnergy and industry emissions for 2021 and 2022 are calculated using IMF GDP growth rates as a proxy for emission growth rates (IMF 2022).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7880):**
>  ## Overview   **With Bhutan being a carbon negative country due to its large land sink, it is already compliant with its NDC target of remaining carbon (and GHG) neutral. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary drop in its emissions, we project that Bhutan's emissions will resume increasing over the course of the decade without additional policies. If allowed to increase unchecked, especially in the industry and transport sectors, they could exceed the level that is sequestered by forests.
