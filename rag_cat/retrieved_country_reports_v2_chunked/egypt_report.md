## Country: Egypt

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8250):**
> **Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8243):**
> The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030. Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8156):**
> The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021). Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8306):**

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7956):**
> Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms. **Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.
