## Country: Singapore

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7997):**
> No review processes have been established for Singapore’s long-term target. Our full net zero target analysis is here.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8158):**
> Most of the remaining natural areas are sanctuaries. We therefore do not consider emissions related to LULUCF sector for the analysis, as they are negligible. ## NDC and other targets   Singapore’s updated NDC provides an absolute emissions level (60 MtCO2e) for 2030 in AR5 GWP (Singapore Government, 2022), which translates to 60.3 MtCO2e in AR4 GWP.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8327):**
> Improving energy efficiency across the economy is the backbone of Singapore’s mitigation strategy. In its latest National Climate Action Plan (Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, 2016), the government listed a number of policies to improve energy efficiency across all sectors, including an Energy Conservation Act, Green Mark Certification and Energy Labelling schemes, and home appliances Energy Performance Standards, among others. The Government has implemented a target of 80% of buildings to be certified green buildings by 2030.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8179):**
> Singapore’s NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C, and would require other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Singapore’s approach, warming would over 3°C and up to 4°C. Singapore has committed to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 as part of its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which is an improvement on its previous loosely defined ‘as soon as viable in the second half of the century’.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8327):**
> Although, pricing carbon needs to be understood in terms of national context, there is a large difference between Singapore’s price and the IPCC 1.5°C pathway range. A carbon tax can encourage more renewable energy in place of fossil fuel energy through changes in relative prices. However, a higher carbon price would need to be implemented earlier, to shift incentives enough to set emissions on a downward trajectory, compatible with the Paris Agreement (Carbon Market Watch, 2017; Warren, 2014).
