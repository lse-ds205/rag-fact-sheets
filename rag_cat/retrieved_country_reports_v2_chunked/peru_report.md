### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7962):**
> No information on the target’s emission coverage   No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping   Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero   Net zero target announced   No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets   Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)   No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals   Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures   Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness. ## Ten key elements   **Scope**   - **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050. - **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8580):**
> For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions. The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8239):**
> In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019). In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7835):**
> This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020).
