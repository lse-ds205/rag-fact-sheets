## Country: Türkiye

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8166):**
> - Introducing a legally binding review of the net zero target to assess progress towards achieving it at regular intervals. Such a review process would benefit from quantified emissions reduction targets for each economic sector, against which progress can be measured. - Explicitly covering international aviation and shipping in the net zero target.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8325):**
> For non-CO2 from energy and industry as well as all gases in agriculture and waste, we follow the same method as indicated above. Finally, we sum all the individual gas projections and sectoral projections together to have an upper and lower bound for all GHG emissions under current policy projections. ## Net-zero target and other long-term targets   To quantify Türkiye’s 2053 emissions, we assume that Türkiye maintains the LULUCF sink of -70 MtCO2 in 2030 as indicated in its 5th Biennial Report ‘With Measures’ scenario through 2053 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8264):**
> Through its 2030 Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan, Türkiye aims to reduce energy consumption by 16% by investing USD 20 bn in energy efficiency projects (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024b). If realised, these investments could allow Türkiye to decouple energy consumption from economic growth and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. Türkiye intends to have 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8438):**
> Türkiye should submit a stronger, 1.5°C compatible NDC target for 2030 as well as 2035 which can provide a realistic pathway towards reaching net zero. Modelled domestic pathways show that aligning with 1.5°C would see Türkiye cut its emissions to 310 MtCO2e in 2030, and 240 MtCO2e in 2035 excluding LULUCF. Türkiye’s recently-announced Roadmap for Renewable Energy to 2035 aims to roll out renewables at a rate of “at least” 7.5–8 GW a year until 2035, along with investments of USD 28 bn to upgrade the grid.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8275):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Türkiye intends to consider using international carbon markets to achieve its net zero target and plans to establish a national carbon crediting system. **Target architecture**   - **Legal status** – The LTS has been submitted to the UNFCCC, but the Climate Law to enshrine the target into law has not yet been passed as of February 2025. - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The LTS does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
