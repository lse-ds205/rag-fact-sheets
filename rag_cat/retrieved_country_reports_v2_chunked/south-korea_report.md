## Country: South Korea

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8522):**
> The net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, it lacks clarity on emissions coverage and detail in the government’s review process.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8386):**
> ## Net-zero target and other long-term targets   South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios present 2050 emissions targets for each sector, in addition to details on targeted removals from LULUCF and CCUS. The CAT considers total emissions excl. LULUCF in 2050.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8345):**
> Emission reductions targets will now be integrated into national budget planning through the climate-responsive budgeting program. The Act also sets up a climate response fund, which will be used to support the structural transformation of carbon-intense industries. With the newly passed 10th Basic Electricity Plan, the new government has changed the direction of the electricity sector, favoring nuclear over renewable energy (see more detail in the energy sector section below).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8202):**
> If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average. **   After former President Moon Jae-in announced South Korea’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, the government also included this commitment in its updated NDC and its Long-Term Strategy (Republic of Korea, 2020, 2021a).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8177):**
> In total, 96.5% of CO2 emissions from energy use in Korea were priced in 2021, unchanged since 2018. Fuel excise taxes, an implicit form of carbon pricing, covered 65.8% of emissions in 2021, unchanged since 2018 (OECD, 2021). The 2020 Green New Deal commits around USD 31 billion to green remodeling, green energy, and eco-friendly vehicles (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2020).
