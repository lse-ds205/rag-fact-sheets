    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**\n",
    "**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**\n",
    "**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**\n",
    "**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**\n",
    "**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**\n",
    "**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**\n",
    "**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**\n",
    "**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**\n",
    "**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**\n",
    "**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**\n",
    "**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**\n",
    "The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.\n",
    "New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.\n",
    "Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
    "In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.\n",
    "The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.\n",
    "Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.\n",
    "The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.\n",
    "**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**\n",
    "New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).\n",
    "The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.\n",
    "This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.\n",
    "New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.\n",
    "Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.\n",
    "For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.\n",
    "New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.\n",
    "New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.\n",
    "There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.\n",
    "The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.\n",
    "The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.\n",
    "New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.\n",
    "The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.\n",
    "Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely \"aspirational\" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).\n",
    "In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.\n",
    "New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).\n",
    "The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.",
    "- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.",
