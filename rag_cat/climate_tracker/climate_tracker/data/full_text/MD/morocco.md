# Summary


## Overview

**Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”.**

Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC.

Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include:

- A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26
- The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector
- The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector
To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could:

- Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community
- Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement
- Stop investing in coal and fossil gas
The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration.

These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all.

The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target.

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress.

However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets.

The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a).

Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**.

In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. As of March 2023, however, the government has neither announced a specific net-zero target year nor any other more detailed information.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information will be communicated.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Morocco does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.
- **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to use international offset credit to meet its tentative net zero target.
- **Legal status** – Morocco has stated its intention to set a net-zero target in its 2021 LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Morocco provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it will provide sectoral analysis to evaluate the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality within the century.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that, under current policies, Morocco’s emissions would reach 88 – 125 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. This means that Morocco is likely to meet its unconditional target (i.e., target to be achieved without international financial support) by 2030. However, Morocco will only be able to achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented. The international community will therefore need to provide financial support to help Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts.

Renewable energy targets are driving Morocco’s current emission reduction efforts. Despite its failure to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, Morocco decided to put forward an even more ambitious plan. It currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. In December 2021, Morocco submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, where it further committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050.

Despite delays in building several key solar power plants, Morocco is ramping up efforts to increase renewable energy capacity with many projects on track to start before 2025. However, considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to keep increasing the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco is also seeking to decarbonise other key sectors of its economy, including the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector. The government also recently released a roadmap highlighting how green hydrogen could consolidate Morocco’s energy transition while supporting decarbonisation efforts in other countries. Increasing renewable energy generation will therefore be crucial to help position Morocco itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

Despite these ambitious planned policies, Morocco still relies heavily on coal and has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure, casting doubt over the country’s ability to achieve its NDC target. Continued reliance on coal and further gas expansion risks locking the country into a high-carbon pathway.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Morocco signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane represented 16% of total emissions (including LULUCF) in 2018 and is mainly concentrated in the agricultural and waste sectors (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). Morocco’s 2021 NDC does not have explicit reduction targets for non-CO2 gases. However, planned mitigation measures in the agricultural sector are expected to have an impact on overall methane emissions (see section on Agriculture).
- **Coal exit:** Morocco endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). The country still heavily relies on coal and has one of the most coal-intensive power sectors in the world, with around 600 tonnes of CO2 emitted per GWh in 2020 (World Bank, 2022).
- **100% EVs:** Morocco adopted the electric vehicle (EV) pledge at COP26. While it did not commit to the 2040 target, Morocco agreed to accelerate the proliferation and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. However, the government has yet to release a concrete EV strategy.
- **Forestry:** Morocco signed the Leaders’ declaration on forest and land use at COP26. While its 2021 NDC does not contain specific targets, the Moroccan government recently released the Forests of Morocco 2020–2030 plan (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020a). The strategy set the target to plant 50,000 hectares of new forests across the country every year until 2030.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** Morocco has not joined the “Beyond Oil & Gas” initiative to end oil and gas exploration and production. In 2022, the government has announced plans to start offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022)

## Energy supply

Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Morocco still heavily relies on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived from coal (IRENA, 2022a). The Moroccan government has until recently continued to invest in the expansion of existing coal infrastructure, with total generating capacity amounting to 4 GW in 2021 (World Bank, 2022). For example, the extension of the Jorf Lasfar Coal Park, a 2.05 GW coal capacity storage park, was commissioned in 2022 (Calik, 2022b).

Morocco has also taken steps to extend the lifetime of several coal plants. In January 2020, the Moroccan Electricity and Water Utility Company, also known as ONEE, extended its power purchasing agreement (PPA) at the same power plant by another 17 years — from 2027 to 2044 (Industry Projects & Technology, 2020).

Morocco has endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit pledge at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants. However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). Power generation needs to be decarbonised well before 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature goal. Coal, in particular, needs to be phased out from power generation worldwide by around 2030 in pathways that limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2022).

Fossil gas plays an increasing role in Morocco’s energy system. In 2017, fossil gas accounted for 18% of Morocco’s total electricity generation (IEA, 2019), and the government intends to further expand fossil gas generated power.

In 2022, the Moroccan government unveiled plans to build four LNG ports, including transport and storage facilities (Gómez, 2022). This announcement came after Algeria halted gas supply via the Maghreb–Europe pipeline, amid diplomatic tensions between the two countries (S&P Global, 2022). To make up for the shortfall, the government decided to start importing LNG from global markets via Spain. Since Morocco doesn’t have any LNG terminals, shipments are sent to Spain to be degasified, then back to Morocco via the same Maghreb–Europe pipeline (L’Opinion, 2023).

With a view to reducing its reliance on gas imports, Morocco has recently opened its the door to offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022). However, to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas exploration and production.

Morocco’s 2021 NDC also sets out plans to build additional combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, which would amount to 450 MW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a).

Morocco’s renewable energy target is the core of its current emissions reduction efforts. The country’s renewable energy capacity amounted to 3.5 GW in 2021. The government set the target to extend the share of renewable electricity capacity to 42% by 2020 and to 52% by 2030 (made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydropower) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016a, 2021a).

Morocco began renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down. While, in absolute terms, renewable energy capacity doubled between 2015 and 2020 (IRENA, 2021), it was not enough to reach the government’s 2020 target. Renewable energy only amounted to 30% of Morocco’s electricity capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2022b). This was partly due to an even higher increase in the share of non-renewable energy capacity in the same period. It should also be noted that aside from wind power, no additional renewable energy capacity was built in 2019 or 2020 (IRENA, 2022a).

However, renewable energy remains the pillar of Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts. On 21 December 2021, the Moroccan government published its Long-Term Strategy, committing to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Government of Morocco, 2021b). Morocco will need to considerably increase the rollout of renewable projects to meet its targets.

Solar power is the main pillar of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy, largely because of the country’s high solar energy potential. The 2030 National Solar Plan, which is included in the 2021 NDC, now aims to reach a total capacity equivalent to 4 GW by 2030.

The 2020 national Solar Plan initially aimed to increase installed solar power capacity (PV and CSP) to 2 GW by 2020. However, the government failed to achieve its target, with installed solar power capacity only amounting to 0.7 MW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). Despite this, the Moroccan government decided to set new, more ambitious targets.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) is at the forefront of the government’s efforts to scale up renewable energy capacity in the country (a role previously assumed by ONEE). MASEN currently oversees the roll out of several solar power projects. However, several key projects were delayed, casting doubts over Morocco’s capacity to reach the targets it set for itself in the 2030 National Solar Plan.

In May 2019, MASEN announced it had awarded the contract for the 800 MW Noor Midelt project. However, the solar plant, which was meant to be completed by 2022, will only start operating in 2024 (Bellini, 2019; Calik, 2022a).

According to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, installed solar power capacity should increase by 0.8 GW in 2023, as several projects are expected to start operations before the end of the year. On top of that, Morocco plans to add 1 GW of installed capacity in 2024 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023c).

As part of the 2030 National wind plan, Morocco currently aims to reach a total wind power capacity of 2.2 GW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). To that end, four wind farms are planned to start operating in 2023 and 2024 (Calik, 2022a). An additional 10 wind power projects are expected to start in the 2022–2025 period, with a total capacity over 900 MW (Calik, 2022a; Kingdom of Morocco, 2023a).

In a 2019 report the World Bank highlighted Morocco’s considerable offshore wind energy potential, which it estimated could amount to 200 GW (22 GW fixed and 178 GW floating) (World Bank, 2019).

In the Morocco Integrated Wind Energy Program, the government initially aimed to increase wind farm capacity from 800 MW in 2015 to 2 GW by 2020 (Government of Morocco, 2016a). Despite steady progress, Morocco did not reach its target, with the country’s installed wind power capacity only amounting to 1.4 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). However, it should be noted that wind power is the only renewable energy source in Morocco which was further expanded in 2019 and 2020, reaching a total capacity of 1435 MW in 2021 (IRENA, 2022c). This programme is assumed to be part of the current policy projections since its implementation is on track.

As of 2021, Morocco’s installed hydropower capacity totalled 1.8 GW (IRENA, 2022c). In its updated NDC, the government set the goal of installing an additional 1.1 GW of hydropower capacity by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). Three pumped storage hydropower plants are under construction, each with a capacity of 300 MW. They are expected to start operating between 2027 and 2029 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023b).

Morocco’s vast renewable energy potential makes it attractive as a potential supplier of green hydrogen (Finance News Hebdo, 2021). The government intends to invest in green hydrogen to consolidate its energy transition and support decarbonisation efforts in other countries.

In 2021, the Moroccan National Hydrogen Commission unveiled a new roadmap, which expects demand for green hydrogen to reach between 14 TWh and 30 TWh by 2030, and between 156 TWh and 307 TWh by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b). The government estimates that this would require an additional 2 GW in renewable energy sources. Morocco would therefore need to focus its efforts on increasing renewable energy generation, if it hopes to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

The roadmap estimates that development of green hydrogen could lead to between 10 MtCO2e to 20 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b).


## Industry

Morocco is one of the world’s leading exporters of phosphate, which, together with cement, accounts for more than three quarters of total emissions from the industry sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

Morocco’s Third Biennial Report submitted to the UNFCCC spells out several mitigation measures in the phosphate sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). If all these policies are implemented, cumulative avoided emission could amount to 41 MtCO2e between 2020 and 2030. These include the following:

- Covering all electricity needs of the industry with renewable energy sources and cogeneration
- Substituting 30% of the fuel oil used for phosphate drying by solar energy (starting in 2028)
- Implementing a carbon capture and utilisation project from phosphate stacks in 2024 (with a capture rate of 20% to reach 100% in 2028)

## Transport

The transport sector accounts for 38% of Morocco’s total final energy consumption (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). In recent years, the Moroccan government has sought to expand and improve its public transportation system. In November 2018, Morocco inaugurated a high-speed train line connecting the capital Rabat to Tangier and Casablanca (AFD, 2018).

Several projects are currently underway. While the Rabat Salé Tramway Company announced the finalisation of an extension in Rabat in February 2022 (TramwayRS, 2022), Casablanca Transport is currently extending two new tramway lines (Railway Pro, 2021; Moovit, 2022). The government also plans to expand the tramways in Rabat and Casablanca by 2025. Similar extensions are planned in the cities of Marrakech, Fez, Tangier and Agadir, although actual implementation has yet to start.

From January 2023, Morocco put in place Euro 6 vehicle emissions standards, which tighten limits on air pollutant emissions, to all new vehicles sold in the Moroccan market (Le Matin, 2021).

Through its National Energy Efficiency Strategy, the Moroccan government is seeking to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of its economy. Morocco currently aims for a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

The market share of electric vehicles (EV) remains extremely low, but the Moroccan government has taken steps to increase their uptake. It installed charging stations on the highway between Tangier and Agadir. An EV plant was recently built in the city of Kenitra, making Morocco the first North African country with the capacity to produce EVs (Tanchum, 2021). The government has also announced plans to build an electric battery factory in the Casablanca region (Ortiz, 2022).

Morocco’s Exemplary Administration Plan aims to have 30% of the government’s state fleet be ecological vehicles (hybrid or electric) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, the government has yet to set up concrete national targets or release an EV strategy.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is an important component of the Moroccan economy, representing 12.5% of GDP and employing 37% of its workforce (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). It is also the second largest emitting sector in Morocco, accounting for 23% of all emissions in 2018 (excluding LULUCF). The agriculture sector emitted around 18 MtCO2e in 2010 and 20 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022). The main source of emissions is agricultural land (52.5% in 2018), followed by enteric fermentation (39,6% in 2018) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

In 2020, the government set out its new agricultural policy in the Green Generation Strategy 2020-2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Agricultural, Fisheries, Rural Development, 2020), replacing the previous Morocco Green Plan. The new strategy aims to double the share of the agricultural sector in Morocco’s GDP and create 350,000 new jobs.

There is a limited number of policies targeted at climate change mitigation in this sector, as the plan mostly focuses on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The mitigation measures mostly consist of increasing plantations (e.g. of olive and citrus trees, date palms, cactus etc.), preventing soil erosion and developing solar water pumping systems (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, no information on the state of their implementation is currently available.

The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions excl. LULUCF for the period 1990–2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2022). LULUCF values up to 2000 were taken from Morocco’s First Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016b), while values after 2000 were taken from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).


## NDC and other targets

Morocco’s NDC targets apply to all sectors. In the CAT, we exclude LULUCF from the NDC target calculations. As Morocco’s new pledge only provides economy-wide business-as-usual (BAU) values, we have taken BAU LULUCF values for 2030 from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a), and deducted these from the economy-wide 2030 BAU scenario presented in the NDC. We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target.

In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a). The BAU provided by Morocco only considers mitigation measures in place before 2010, which is used as the base year.

In the two documents mentioned above, Morocco has put forward a detailed list of mitigation measures it will implement to reach its 2030 target, separated into conditional and unconditional measures (i.e., measures to be achieved with and without international financial support). There is little information on their state of implementation. However, despite initial delays, Morocco is ramping up efforts to meet its ambitious renewable energy target. As such, we believe Morocco is still on track to meet its 2030 targets.

For the lower end of the current policy scenario, we start by determining the value for 2030, using the 2030 BAU minus the unconditional and conditional mitigation potentials. We then interpolate between 2021-2030, assuming Morocco could still catch up to reach the 2030 mitigation level (Morocco is already delayed on their mitigation trajectory in 2020-2021).

For the upper end of the current policy scenario, we use the same approach but deduct the unconditional mitigation potential only from the BAU trajectory. There are still uncertainties regarding the extent of climate finance Morocco will receive, and therefore the mitigation measures they will be able to put in place.

We also excluded the LULUCF related measures planned the in the agricultural in the current policies projection.

It should be noted that plans to ramp up gas and start offshore extraction are not taken into account in the policy projections. Additionally, it is unclear what impact lifetime extension of existing coal fired power plants will have on the CPP range, as there is no information on what is exactly taken into account in the BAU provided by Morocco.


## Global Warming Potentials values

Morocco previously used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). In the 2021 NDC and the other documents submitted to UNFCCC, GWP are communicated using the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) values. The CAT reports all results using AR4 GWP.


# Targets


## Target Overview

Morocco submitted its latest NDC update to the UNFCCC in July 2021, strengthening its initial pledge. The updated target includes an unconditional emissions reduction of 18.3% below BAU by 2030, up from a 17% reduction in the previous NDC. Thanks to an updated BAU scenario, this new target translates to an absolute emissions level that is 21% lower than the previous target—from 145 MtCO2e in the 2016 submission to 118 MtCO2e in the latest one (excluding LULUCF).

The conditional target was strengthened to 45% below BAU by 2030, up from a 42% reduction target in the first NDC. We estimate this would translate to an absolute emissions level of 84 MtCO2e by 2030. The CAT rates Morocco’s target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways and when rated against the fair share contribution.

Morocco is on track to meet its unconditional target by 2030. However, it will only achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented.

In December 2021, Morocco submitted its long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, in which it committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). In its LTS, Morocco also stated it will explore scenarios to achieve net zero emissions . The government intends to consider scenarios based on sectoral analysis to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. However, a concrete plan has yet to be released.

Morocco has not submitted a new NDC since COP26 despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27.On 8 November 2021, the disputed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) published an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) for Western Sahara. It should be noted that the CAT only took into account the NDC provided by the Moroccan government and does not cover the iNDC, as SADR is not a party to the UNFCCC. It remains unclear to what extent Morocco’s planned mitigation measures, in particular in the renewable energy sector, will also be implemented in the disputed Western Sahara region.


## NDC updates

Morocco’s updated NDC, submitted on 22 June 2021, strengthened its 2030 target, improving it in two ways. First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 compared to the first NDC submission, and 29% for the conditional target.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 22.07.2021 – Morocco leads the way with a new, more ambitious NDC.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Morocco will need support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Morocco has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). As of March 2023, a concrete plan and timeline have yet to be released.

Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target. We will do so once further information is communicated.


# Summary


## Overview

**Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”.**

Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC.

Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include:

- A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26
- The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector
- The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector
To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could:

- Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community
- Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement
- Stop investing in coal and fossil gas
The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration.

These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all.

The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target.

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress.

However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets.

The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a).

Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**.

In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. As of March 2023, however, the government has neither announced a specific net-zero target year nor any other more detailed information.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information will be communicated.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Morocco does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.
- **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to use international offset credit to meet its tentative net zero target.
- **Legal status** – Morocco has stated its intention to set a net-zero target in its 2021 LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Morocco provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it will provide sectoral analysis to evaluate the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality within the century.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that, under current policies, Morocco’s emissions would reach 88 – 125 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. This means that Morocco is likely to meet its unconditional target (i.e., target to be achieved without international financial support) by 2030. However, Morocco will only be able to achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented. The international community will therefore need to provide financial support to help Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts.

Renewable energy targets are driving Morocco’s current emission reduction efforts. Despite its failure to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, Morocco decided to put forward an even more ambitious plan. It currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. In December 2021, Morocco submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, where it further committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050.

Despite delays in building several key solar power plants, Morocco is ramping up efforts to increase renewable energy capacity with many projects on track to start before 2025. However, considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to keep increasing the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco is also seeking to decarbonise other key sectors of its economy, including the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector. The government also recently released a roadmap highlighting how green hydrogen could consolidate Morocco’s energy transition while supporting decarbonisation efforts in other countries. Increasing renewable energy generation will therefore be crucial to help position Morocco itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

Despite these ambitious planned policies, Morocco still relies heavily on coal and has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure, casting doubt over the country’s ability to achieve its NDC target. Continued reliance on coal and further gas expansion risks locking the country into a high-carbon pathway.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Morocco signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane represented 16% of total emissions (including LULUCF) in 2018 and is mainly concentrated in the agricultural and waste sectors (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). Morocco’s 2021 NDC does not have explicit reduction targets for non-CO2 gases. However, planned mitigation measures in the agricultural sector are expected to have an impact on overall methane emissions (see section on Agriculture).
- **Coal exit:** Morocco endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). The country still heavily relies on coal and has one of the most coal-intensive power sectors in the world, with around 600 tonnes of CO2 emitted per GWh in 2020 (World Bank, 2022).
- **100% EVs:** Morocco adopted the electric vehicle (EV) pledge at COP26. While it did not commit to the 2040 target, Morocco agreed to accelerate the proliferation and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. However, the government has yet to release a concrete EV strategy.
- **Forestry:** Morocco signed the Leaders’ declaration on forest and land use at COP26. While its 2021 NDC does not contain specific targets, the Moroccan government recently released the Forests of Morocco 2020–2030 plan (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020a). The strategy set the target to plant 50,000 hectares of new forests across the country every year until 2030.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** Morocco has not joined the “Beyond Oil & Gas” initiative to end oil and gas exploration and production. In 2022, the government has announced plans to start offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022)

## Energy supply

Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Morocco still heavily relies on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived from coal (IRENA, 2022a). The Moroccan government has until recently continued to invest in the expansion of existing coal infrastructure, with total generating capacity amounting to 4 GW in 2021 (World Bank, 2022). For example, the extension of the Jorf Lasfar Coal Park, a 2.05 GW coal capacity storage park, was commissioned in 2022 (Calik, 2022b).

Morocco has also taken steps to extend the lifetime of several coal plants. In January 2020, the Moroccan Electricity and Water Utility Company, also known as ONEE, extended its power purchasing agreement (PPA) at the same power plant by another 17 years — from 2027 to 2044 (Industry Projects & Technology, 2020).

Morocco has endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit pledge at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants. However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). Power generation needs to be decarbonised well before 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature goal. Coal, in particular, needs to be phased out from power generation worldwide by around 2030 in pathways that limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2022).

Fossil gas plays an increasing role in Morocco’s energy system. In 2017, fossil gas accounted for 18% of Morocco’s total electricity generation (IEA, 2019), and the government intends to further expand fossil gas generated power.

In 2022, the Moroccan government unveiled plans to build four LNG ports, including transport and storage facilities (Gómez, 2022). This announcement came after Algeria halted gas supply via the Maghreb–Europe pipeline, amid diplomatic tensions between the two countries (S&P Global, 2022). To make up for the shortfall, the government decided to start importing LNG from global markets via Spain. Since Morocco doesn’t have any LNG terminals, shipments are sent to Spain to be degasified, then back to Morocco via the same Maghreb–Europe pipeline (L’Opinion, 2023).

With a view to reducing its reliance on gas imports, Morocco has recently opened its the door to offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022). However, to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas exploration and production.

Morocco’s 2021 NDC also sets out plans to build additional combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, which would amount to 450 MW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a).

Morocco’s renewable energy target is the core of its current emissions reduction efforts. The country’s renewable energy capacity amounted to 3.5 GW in 2021. The government set the target to extend the share of renewable electricity capacity to 42% by 2020 and to 52% by 2030 (made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydropower) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016a, 2021a).

Morocco began renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down. While, in absolute terms, renewable energy capacity doubled between 2015 and 2020 (IRENA, 2021), it was not enough to reach the government’s 2020 target. Renewable energy only amounted to 30% of Morocco’s electricity capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2022b). This was partly due to an even higher increase in the share of non-renewable energy capacity in the same period. It should also be noted that aside from wind power, no additional renewable energy capacity was built in 2019 or 2020 (IRENA, 2022a).

However, renewable energy remains the pillar of Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts. On 21 December 2021, the Moroccan government published its Long-Term Strategy, committing to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Government of Morocco, 2021b). Morocco will need to considerably increase the rollout of renewable projects to meet its targets.

Solar power is the main pillar of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy, largely because of the country’s high solar energy potential. The 2030 National Solar Plan, which is included in the 2021 NDC, now aims to reach a total capacity equivalent to 4 GW by 2030.

The 2020 national Solar Plan initially aimed to increase installed solar power capacity (PV and CSP) to 2 GW by 2020. However, the government failed to achieve its target, with installed solar power capacity only amounting to 0.7 MW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). Despite this, the Moroccan government decided to set new, more ambitious targets.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) is at the forefront of the government’s efforts to scale up renewable energy capacity in the country (a role previously assumed by ONEE). MASEN currently oversees the roll out of several solar power projects. However, several key projects were delayed, casting doubts over Morocco’s capacity to reach the targets it set for itself in the 2030 National Solar Plan.

In May 2019, MASEN announced it had awarded the contract for the 800 MW Noor Midelt project. However, the solar plant, which was meant to be completed by 2022, will only start operating in 2024 (Bellini, 2019; Calik, 2022a).

According to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, installed solar power capacity should increase by 0.8 GW in 2023, as several projects are expected to start operations before the end of the year. On top of that, Morocco plans to add 1 GW of installed capacity in 2024 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023c).

As part of the 2030 National wind plan, Morocco currently aims to reach a total wind power capacity of 2.2 GW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). To that end, four wind farms are planned to start operating in 2023 and 2024 (Calik, 2022a). An additional 10 wind power projects are expected to start in the 2022–2025 period, with a total capacity over 900 MW (Calik, 2022a; Kingdom of Morocco, 2023a).

In a 2019 report the World Bank highlighted Morocco’s considerable offshore wind energy potential, which it estimated could amount to 200 GW (22 GW fixed and 178 GW floating) (World Bank, 2019).

In the Morocco Integrated Wind Energy Program, the government initially aimed to increase wind farm capacity from 800 MW in 2015 to 2 GW by 2020 (Government of Morocco, 2016a). Despite steady progress, Morocco did not reach its target, with the country’s installed wind power capacity only amounting to 1.4 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). However, it should be noted that wind power is the only renewable energy source in Morocco which was further expanded in 2019 and 2020, reaching a total capacity of 1435 MW in 2021 (IRENA, 2022c). This programme is assumed to be part of the current policy projections since its implementation is on track.

As of 2021, Morocco’s installed hydropower capacity totalled 1.8 GW (IRENA, 2022c). In its updated NDC, the government set the goal of installing an additional 1.1 GW of hydropower capacity by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). Three pumped storage hydropower plants are under construction, each with a capacity of 300 MW. They are expected to start operating between 2027 and 2029 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023b).

Morocco’s vast renewable energy potential makes it attractive as a potential supplier of green hydrogen (Finance News Hebdo, 2021). The government intends to invest in green hydrogen to consolidate its energy transition and support decarbonisation efforts in other countries.

In 2021, the Moroccan National Hydrogen Commission unveiled a new roadmap, which expects demand for green hydrogen to reach between 14 TWh and 30 TWh by 2030, and between 156 TWh and 307 TWh by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b). The government estimates that this would require an additional 2 GW in renewable energy sources. Morocco would therefore need to focus its efforts on increasing renewable energy generation, if it hopes to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

The roadmap estimates that development of green hydrogen could lead to between 10 MtCO2e to 20 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b).


## Industry

Morocco is one of the world’s leading exporters of phosphate, which, together with cement, accounts for more than three quarters of total emissions from the industry sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

Morocco’s Third Biennial Report submitted to the UNFCCC spells out several mitigation measures in the phosphate sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). If all these policies are implemented, cumulative avoided emission could amount to 41 MtCO2e between 2020 and 2030. These include the following:

- Covering all electricity needs of the industry with renewable energy sources and cogeneration
- Substituting 30% of the fuel oil used for phosphate drying by solar energy (starting in 2028)
- Implementing a carbon capture and utilisation project from phosphate stacks in 2024 (with a capture rate of 20% to reach 100% in 2028)

## Transport

The transport sector accounts for 38% of Morocco’s total final energy consumption (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). In recent years, the Moroccan government has sought to expand and improve its public transportation system. In November 2018, Morocco inaugurated a high-speed train line connecting the capital Rabat to Tangier and Casablanca (AFD, 2018).

Several projects are currently underway. While the Rabat Salé Tramway Company announced the finalisation of an extension in Rabat in February 2022 (TramwayRS, 2022), Casablanca Transport is currently extending two new tramway lines (Railway Pro, 2021; Moovit, 2022). The government also plans to expand the tramways in Rabat and Casablanca by 2025. Similar extensions are planned in the cities of Marrakech, Fez, Tangier and Agadir, although actual implementation has yet to start.

From January 2023, Morocco put in place Euro 6 vehicle emissions standards, which tighten limits on air pollutant emissions, to all new vehicles sold in the Moroccan market (Le Matin, 2021).

Through its National Energy Efficiency Strategy, the Moroccan government is seeking to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of its economy. Morocco currently aims for a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

The market share of electric vehicles (EV) remains extremely low, but the Moroccan government has taken steps to increase their uptake. It installed charging stations on the highway between Tangier and Agadir. An EV plant was recently built in the city of Kenitra, making Morocco the first North African country with the capacity to produce EVs (Tanchum, 2021). The government has also announced plans to build an electric battery factory in the Casablanca region (Ortiz, 2022).

Morocco’s Exemplary Administration Plan aims to have 30% of the government’s state fleet be ecological vehicles (hybrid or electric) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, the government has yet to set up concrete national targets or release an EV strategy.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is an important component of the Moroccan economy, representing 12.5% of GDP and employing 37% of its workforce (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). It is also the second largest emitting sector in Morocco, accounting for 23% of all emissions in 2018 (excluding LULUCF). The agriculture sector emitted around 18 MtCO2e in 2010 and 20 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022). The main source of emissions is agricultural land (52.5% in 2018), followed by enteric fermentation (39,6% in 2018) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

In 2020, the government set out its new agricultural policy in the Green Generation Strategy 2020-2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Agricultural, Fisheries, Rural Development, 2020), replacing the previous Morocco Green Plan. The new strategy aims to double the share of the agricultural sector in Morocco’s GDP and create 350,000 new jobs.

There is a limited number of policies targeted at climate change mitigation in this sector, as the plan mostly focuses on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The mitigation measures mostly consist of increasing plantations (e.g. of olive and citrus trees, date palms, cactus etc.), preventing soil erosion and developing solar water pumping systems (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, no information on the state of their implementation is currently available.

The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions excl. LULUCF for the period 1990–2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2022). LULUCF values up to 2000 were taken from Morocco’s First Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016b), while values after 2000 were taken from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).


## NDC and other targets

Morocco’s NDC targets apply to all sectors. In the CAT, we exclude LULUCF from the NDC target calculations. As Morocco’s new pledge only provides economy-wide business-as-usual (BAU) values, we have taken BAU LULUCF values for 2030 from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a), and deducted these from the economy-wide 2030 BAU scenario presented in the NDC. We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target.

In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a). The BAU provided by Morocco only considers mitigation measures in place before 2010, which is used as the base year.

In the two documents mentioned above, Morocco has put forward a detailed list of mitigation measures it will implement to reach its 2030 target, separated into conditional and unconditional measures (i.e., measures to be achieved with and without international financial support). There is little information on their state of implementation. However, despite initial delays, Morocco is ramping up efforts to meet its ambitious renewable energy target. As such, we believe Morocco is still on track to meet its 2030 targets.

For the lower end of the current policy scenario, we start by determining the value for 2030, using the 2030 BAU minus the unconditional and conditional mitigation potentials. We then interpolate between 2021-2030, assuming Morocco could still catch up to reach the 2030 mitigation level (Morocco is already delayed on their mitigation trajectory in 2020-2021).

For the upper end of the current policy scenario, we use the same approach but deduct the unconditional mitigation potential only from the BAU trajectory. There are still uncertainties regarding the extent of climate finance Morocco will receive, and therefore the mitigation measures they will be able to put in place.

We also excluded the LULUCF related measures planned the in the agricultural in the current policies projection.

It should be noted that plans to ramp up gas and start offshore extraction are not taken into account in the policy projections. Additionally, it is unclear what impact lifetime extension of existing coal fired power plants will have on the CPP range, as there is no information on what is exactly taken into account in the BAU provided by Morocco.


## Global Warming Potentials values

Morocco previously used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). In the 2021 NDC and the other documents submitted to UNFCCC, GWP are communicated using the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) values. The CAT reports all results using AR4 GWP.


# Targets


## Target Overview

Morocco submitted its latest NDC update to the UNFCCC in July 2021, strengthening its initial pledge. The updated target includes an unconditional emissions reduction of 18.3% below BAU by 2030, up from a 17% reduction in the previous NDC. Thanks to an updated BAU scenario, this new target translates to an absolute emissions level that is 21% lower than the previous target—from 145 MtCO2e in the 2016 submission to 118 MtCO2e in the latest one (excluding LULUCF).

The conditional target was strengthened to 45% below BAU by 2030, up from a 42% reduction target in the first NDC. We estimate this would translate to an absolute emissions level of 84 MtCO2e by 2030. The CAT rates Morocco’s target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways and when rated against the fair share contribution.

Morocco is on track to meet its unconditional target by 2030. However, it will only achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented.

In December 2021, Morocco submitted its long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, in which it committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). In its LTS, Morocco also stated it will explore scenarios to achieve net zero emissions . The government intends to consider scenarios based on sectoral analysis to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. However, a concrete plan has yet to be released.

Morocco has not submitted a new NDC since COP26 despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27.On 8 November 2021, the disputed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) published an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) for Western Sahara. It should be noted that the CAT only took into account the NDC provided by the Moroccan government and does not cover the iNDC, as SADR is not a party to the UNFCCC. It remains unclear to what extent Morocco’s planned mitigation measures, in particular in the renewable energy sector, will also be implemented in the disputed Western Sahara region.


## NDC updates

Morocco’s updated NDC, submitted on 22 June 2021, strengthened its 2030 target, improving it in two ways. First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 compared to the first NDC submission, and 29% for the conditional target.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 22.07.2021 – Morocco leads the way with a new, more ambitious NDC.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Morocco will need support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Morocco has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). As of March 2023, a concrete plan and timeline have yet to be released.

Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target. We will do so once further information is communicated.


# Summary


## Overview

**Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”.**

Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC.

Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include:

- A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26
- The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector
- The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector
To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could:

- Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community
- Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement
- Stop investing in coal and fossil gas
The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration.

These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all.

The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target.

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress.

However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets.

The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a).

Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**.

In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. As of March 2023, however, the government has neither announced a specific net-zero target year nor any other more detailed information.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information will be communicated.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Morocco does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.
- **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to use international offset credit to meet its tentative net zero target.
- **Legal status** – Morocco has stated its intention to set a net-zero target in its 2021 LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Morocco provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it will provide sectoral analysis to evaluate the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality within the century.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that, under current policies, Morocco’s emissions would reach 88 – 125 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. This means that Morocco is likely to meet its unconditional target (i.e., target to be achieved without international financial support) by 2030. However, Morocco will only be able to achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented. The international community will therefore need to provide financial support to help Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts.

Renewable energy targets are driving Morocco’s current emission reduction efforts. Despite its failure to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, Morocco decided to put forward an even more ambitious plan. It currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. In December 2021, Morocco submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, where it further committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050.

Despite delays in building several key solar power plants, Morocco is ramping up efforts to increase renewable energy capacity with many projects on track to start before 2025. However, considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to keep increasing the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco is also seeking to decarbonise other key sectors of its economy, including the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector. The government also recently released a roadmap highlighting how green hydrogen could consolidate Morocco’s energy transition while supporting decarbonisation efforts in other countries. Increasing renewable energy generation will therefore be crucial to help position Morocco itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

Despite these ambitious planned policies, Morocco still relies heavily on coal and has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure, casting doubt over the country’s ability to achieve its NDC target. Continued reliance on coal and further gas expansion risks locking the country into a high-carbon pathway.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Morocco signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane represented 16% of total emissions (including LULUCF) in 2018 and is mainly concentrated in the agricultural and waste sectors (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). Morocco’s 2021 NDC does not have explicit reduction targets for non-CO2 gases. However, planned mitigation measures in the agricultural sector are expected to have an impact on overall methane emissions (see section on Agriculture).
- **Coal exit:** Morocco endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). The country still heavily relies on coal and has one of the most coal-intensive power sectors in the world, with around 600 tonnes of CO2 emitted per GWh in 2020 (World Bank, 2022).
- **100% EVs:** Morocco adopted the electric vehicle (EV) pledge at COP26. While it did not commit to the 2040 target, Morocco agreed to accelerate the proliferation and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. However, the government has yet to release a concrete EV strategy.
- **Forestry:** Morocco signed the Leaders’ declaration on forest and land use at COP26. While its 2021 NDC does not contain specific targets, the Moroccan government recently released the Forests of Morocco 2020–2030 plan (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020a). The strategy set the target to plant 50,000 hectares of new forests across the country every year until 2030.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** Morocco has not joined the “Beyond Oil & Gas” initiative to end oil and gas exploration and production. In 2022, the government has announced plans to start offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022)

## Energy supply

Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Morocco still heavily relies on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived from coal (IRENA, 2022a). The Moroccan government has until recently continued to invest in the expansion of existing coal infrastructure, with total generating capacity amounting to 4 GW in 2021 (World Bank, 2022). For example, the extension of the Jorf Lasfar Coal Park, a 2.05 GW coal capacity storage park, was commissioned in 2022 (Calik, 2022b).

Morocco has also taken steps to extend the lifetime of several coal plants. In January 2020, the Moroccan Electricity and Water Utility Company, also known as ONEE, extended its power purchasing agreement (PPA) at the same power plant by another 17 years — from 2027 to 2044 (Industry Projects & Technology, 2020).

Morocco has endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit pledge at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants. However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). Power generation needs to be decarbonised well before 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature goal. Coal, in particular, needs to be phased out from power generation worldwide by around 2030 in pathways that limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2022).

Fossil gas plays an increasing role in Morocco’s energy system. In 2017, fossil gas accounted for 18% of Morocco’s total electricity generation (IEA, 2019), and the government intends to further expand fossil gas generated power.

In 2022, the Moroccan government unveiled plans to build four LNG ports, including transport and storage facilities (Gómez, 2022). This announcement came after Algeria halted gas supply via the Maghreb–Europe pipeline, amid diplomatic tensions between the two countries (S&P Global, 2022). To make up for the shortfall, the government decided to start importing LNG from global markets via Spain. Since Morocco doesn’t have any LNG terminals, shipments are sent to Spain to be degasified, then back to Morocco via the same Maghreb–Europe pipeline (L’Opinion, 2023).

With a view to reducing its reliance on gas imports, Morocco has recently opened its the door to offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022). However, to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas exploration and production.

Morocco’s 2021 NDC also sets out plans to build additional combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, which would amount to 450 MW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a).

Morocco’s renewable energy target is the core of its current emissions reduction efforts. The country’s renewable energy capacity amounted to 3.5 GW in 2021. The government set the target to extend the share of renewable electricity capacity to 42% by 2020 and to 52% by 2030 (made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydropower) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016a, 2021a).

Morocco began renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down. While, in absolute terms, renewable energy capacity doubled between 2015 and 2020 (IRENA, 2021), it was not enough to reach the government’s 2020 target. Renewable energy only amounted to 30% of Morocco’s electricity capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2022b). This was partly due to an even higher increase in the share of non-renewable energy capacity in the same period. It should also be noted that aside from wind power, no additional renewable energy capacity was built in 2019 or 2020 (IRENA, 2022a).

However, renewable energy remains the pillar of Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts. On 21 December 2021, the Moroccan government published its Long-Term Strategy, committing to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Government of Morocco, 2021b). Morocco will need to considerably increase the rollout of renewable projects to meet its targets.

Solar power is the main pillar of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy, largely because of the country’s high solar energy potential. The 2030 National Solar Plan, which is included in the 2021 NDC, now aims to reach a total capacity equivalent to 4 GW by 2030.

The 2020 national Solar Plan initially aimed to increase installed solar power capacity (PV and CSP) to 2 GW by 2020. However, the government failed to achieve its target, with installed solar power capacity only amounting to 0.7 MW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). Despite this, the Moroccan government decided to set new, more ambitious targets.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) is at the forefront of the government’s efforts to scale up renewable energy capacity in the country (a role previously assumed by ONEE). MASEN currently oversees the roll out of several solar power projects. However, several key projects were delayed, casting doubts over Morocco’s capacity to reach the targets it set for itself in the 2030 National Solar Plan.

In May 2019, MASEN announced it had awarded the contract for the 800 MW Noor Midelt project. However, the solar plant, which was meant to be completed by 2022, will only start operating in 2024 (Bellini, 2019; Calik, 2022a).

According to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, installed solar power capacity should increase by 0.8 GW in 2023, as several projects are expected to start operations before the end of the year. On top of that, Morocco plans to add 1 GW of installed capacity in 2024 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023c).

As part of the 2030 National wind plan, Morocco currently aims to reach a total wind power capacity of 2.2 GW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). To that end, four wind farms are planned to start operating in 2023 and 2024 (Calik, 2022a). An additional 10 wind power projects are expected to start in the 2022–2025 period, with a total capacity over 900 MW (Calik, 2022a; Kingdom of Morocco, 2023a).

In a 2019 report the World Bank highlighted Morocco’s considerable offshore wind energy potential, which it estimated could amount to 200 GW (22 GW fixed and 178 GW floating) (World Bank, 2019).

In the Morocco Integrated Wind Energy Program, the government initially aimed to increase wind farm capacity from 800 MW in 2015 to 2 GW by 2020 (Government of Morocco, 2016a). Despite steady progress, Morocco did not reach its target, with the country’s installed wind power capacity only amounting to 1.4 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). However, it should be noted that wind power is the only renewable energy source in Morocco which was further expanded in 2019 and 2020, reaching a total capacity of 1435 MW in 2021 (IRENA, 2022c). This programme is assumed to be part of the current policy projections since its implementation is on track.

As of 2021, Morocco’s installed hydropower capacity totalled 1.8 GW (IRENA, 2022c). In its updated NDC, the government set the goal of installing an additional 1.1 GW of hydropower capacity by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). Three pumped storage hydropower plants are under construction, each with a capacity of 300 MW. They are expected to start operating between 2027 and 2029 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023b).

Morocco’s vast renewable energy potential makes it attractive as a potential supplier of green hydrogen (Finance News Hebdo, 2021). The government intends to invest in green hydrogen to consolidate its energy transition and support decarbonisation efforts in other countries.

In 2021, the Moroccan National Hydrogen Commission unveiled a new roadmap, which expects demand for green hydrogen to reach between 14 TWh and 30 TWh by 2030, and between 156 TWh and 307 TWh by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b). The government estimates that this would require an additional 2 GW in renewable energy sources. Morocco would therefore need to focus its efforts on increasing renewable energy generation, if it hopes to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

The roadmap estimates that development of green hydrogen could lead to between 10 MtCO2e to 20 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b).


## Industry

Morocco is one of the world’s leading exporters of phosphate, which, together with cement, accounts for more than three quarters of total emissions from the industry sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

Morocco’s Third Biennial Report submitted to the UNFCCC spells out several mitigation measures in the phosphate sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). If all these policies are implemented, cumulative avoided emission could amount to 41 MtCO2e between 2020 and 2030. These include the following:

- Covering all electricity needs of the industry with renewable energy sources and cogeneration
- Substituting 30% of the fuel oil used for phosphate drying by solar energy (starting in 2028)
- Implementing a carbon capture and utilisation project from phosphate stacks in 2024 (with a capture rate of 20% to reach 100% in 2028)

## Transport

The transport sector accounts for 38% of Morocco’s total final energy consumption (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). In recent years, the Moroccan government has sought to expand and improve its public transportation system. In November 2018, Morocco inaugurated a high-speed train line connecting the capital Rabat to Tangier and Casablanca (AFD, 2018).

Several projects are currently underway. While the Rabat Salé Tramway Company announced the finalisation of an extension in Rabat in February 2022 (TramwayRS, 2022), Casablanca Transport is currently extending two new tramway lines (Railway Pro, 2021; Moovit, 2022). The government also plans to expand the tramways in Rabat and Casablanca by 2025. Similar extensions are planned in the cities of Marrakech, Fez, Tangier and Agadir, although actual implementation has yet to start.

From January 2023, Morocco put in place Euro 6 vehicle emissions standards, which tighten limits on air pollutant emissions, to all new vehicles sold in the Moroccan market (Le Matin, 2021).

Through its National Energy Efficiency Strategy, the Moroccan government is seeking to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of its economy. Morocco currently aims for a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

The market share of electric vehicles (EV) remains extremely low, but the Moroccan government has taken steps to increase their uptake. It installed charging stations on the highway between Tangier and Agadir. An EV plant was recently built in the city of Kenitra, making Morocco the first North African country with the capacity to produce EVs (Tanchum, 2021). The government has also announced plans to build an electric battery factory in the Casablanca region (Ortiz, 2022).

Morocco’s Exemplary Administration Plan aims to have 30% of the government’s state fleet be ecological vehicles (hybrid or electric) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, the government has yet to set up concrete national targets or release an EV strategy.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is an important component of the Moroccan economy, representing 12.5% of GDP and employing 37% of its workforce (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). It is also the second largest emitting sector in Morocco, accounting for 23% of all emissions in 2018 (excluding LULUCF). The agriculture sector emitted around 18 MtCO2e in 2010 and 20 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022). The main source of emissions is agricultural land (52.5% in 2018), followed by enteric fermentation (39,6% in 2018) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

In 2020, the government set out its new agricultural policy in the Green Generation Strategy 2020-2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Agricultural, Fisheries, Rural Development, 2020), replacing the previous Morocco Green Plan. The new strategy aims to double the share of the agricultural sector in Morocco’s GDP and create 350,000 new jobs.

There is a limited number of policies targeted at climate change mitigation in this sector, as the plan mostly focuses on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The mitigation measures mostly consist of increasing plantations (e.g. of olive and citrus trees, date palms, cactus etc.), preventing soil erosion and developing solar water pumping systems (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, no information on the state of their implementation is currently available.

The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions excl. LULUCF for the period 1990–2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2022). LULUCF values up to 2000 were taken from Morocco’s First Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016b), while values after 2000 were taken from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).


## NDC and other targets

Morocco’s NDC targets apply to all sectors. In the CAT, we exclude LULUCF from the NDC target calculations. As Morocco’s new pledge only provides economy-wide business-as-usual (BAU) values, we have taken BAU LULUCF values for 2030 from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a), and deducted these from the economy-wide 2030 BAU scenario presented in the NDC. We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target.

In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a). The BAU provided by Morocco only considers mitigation measures in place before 2010, which is used as the base year.

In the two documents mentioned above, Morocco has put forward a detailed list of mitigation measures it will implement to reach its 2030 target, separated into conditional and unconditional measures (i.e., measures to be achieved with and without international financial support). There is little information on their state of implementation. However, despite initial delays, Morocco is ramping up efforts to meet its ambitious renewable energy target. As such, we believe Morocco is still on track to meet its 2030 targets.

For the lower end of the current policy scenario, we start by determining the value for 2030, using the 2030 BAU minus the unconditional and conditional mitigation potentials. We then interpolate between 2021-2030, assuming Morocco could still catch up to reach the 2030 mitigation level (Morocco is already delayed on their mitigation trajectory in 2020-2021).

For the upper end of the current policy scenario, we use the same approach but deduct the unconditional mitigation potential only from the BAU trajectory. There are still uncertainties regarding the extent of climate finance Morocco will receive, and therefore the mitigation measures they will be able to put in place.

We also excluded the LULUCF related measures planned the in the agricultural in the current policies projection.

It should be noted that plans to ramp up gas and start offshore extraction are not taken into account in the policy projections. Additionally, it is unclear what impact lifetime extension of existing coal fired power plants will have on the CPP range, as there is no information on what is exactly taken into account in the BAU provided by Morocco.


## Global Warming Potentials values

Morocco previously used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). In the 2021 NDC and the other documents submitted to UNFCCC, GWP are communicated using the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) values. The CAT reports all results using AR4 GWP.


# Targets


## Target Overview

Morocco submitted its latest NDC update to the UNFCCC in July 2021, strengthening its initial pledge. The updated target includes an unconditional emissions reduction of 18.3% below BAU by 2030, up from a 17% reduction in the previous NDC. Thanks to an updated BAU scenario, this new target translates to an absolute emissions level that is 21% lower than the previous target—from 145 MtCO2e in the 2016 submission to 118 MtCO2e in the latest one (excluding LULUCF).

The conditional target was strengthened to 45% below BAU by 2030, up from a 42% reduction target in the first NDC. We estimate this would translate to an absolute emissions level of 84 MtCO2e by 2030. The CAT rates Morocco’s target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways and when rated against the fair share contribution.

Morocco is on track to meet its unconditional target by 2030. However, it will only achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented.

In December 2021, Morocco submitted its long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, in which it committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). In its LTS, Morocco also stated it will explore scenarios to achieve net zero emissions . The government intends to consider scenarios based on sectoral analysis to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. However, a concrete plan has yet to be released.

Morocco has not submitted a new NDC since COP26 despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27.On 8 November 2021, the disputed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) published an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) for Western Sahara. It should be noted that the CAT only took into account the NDC provided by the Moroccan government and does not cover the iNDC, as SADR is not a party to the UNFCCC. It remains unclear to what extent Morocco’s planned mitigation measures, in particular in the renewable energy sector, will also be implemented in the disputed Western Sahara region.


## NDC updates

Morocco’s updated NDC, submitted on 22 June 2021, strengthened its 2030 target, improving it in two ways. First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 compared to the first NDC submission, and 29% for the conditional target.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 22.07.2021 – Morocco leads the way with a new, more ambitious NDC.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Morocco will need support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Morocco has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). As of March 2023, a concrete plan and timeline have yet to be released.

Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target. We will do so once further information is communicated.


# Summary


## Overview

**Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”.**

Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC.

Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include:

- A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26
- The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector
- The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector
To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could:

- Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community
- Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement
- Stop investing in coal and fossil gas
The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration.

These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all.

The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target.

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress.

However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets.

The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a).

Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**.

In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. As of March 2023, however, the government has neither announced a specific net-zero target year nor any other more detailed information.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information will be communicated.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Morocco does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.
- **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to use international offset credit to meet its tentative net zero target.
- **Legal status** – Morocco has stated its intention to set a net-zero target in its 2021 LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Morocco provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it will provide sectoral analysis to evaluate the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality within the century.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that, under current policies, Morocco’s emissions would reach 88 – 125 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. This means that Morocco is likely to meet its unconditional target (i.e., target to be achieved without international financial support) by 2030. However, Morocco will only be able to achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented. The international community will therefore need to provide financial support to help Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts.

Renewable energy targets are driving Morocco’s current emission reduction efforts. Despite its failure to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, Morocco decided to put forward an even more ambitious plan. It currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. In December 2021, Morocco submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, where it further committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050.

Despite delays in building several key solar power plants, Morocco is ramping up efforts to increase renewable energy capacity with many projects on track to start before 2025. However, considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to keep increasing the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco is also seeking to decarbonise other key sectors of its economy, including the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector. The government also recently released a roadmap highlighting how green hydrogen could consolidate Morocco’s energy transition while supporting decarbonisation efforts in other countries. Increasing renewable energy generation will therefore be crucial to help position Morocco itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

Despite these ambitious planned policies, Morocco still relies heavily on coal and has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure, casting doubt over the country’s ability to achieve its NDC target. Continued reliance on coal and further gas expansion risks locking the country into a high-carbon pathway.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Morocco signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane represented 16% of total emissions (including LULUCF) in 2018 and is mainly concentrated in the agricultural and waste sectors (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). Morocco’s 2021 NDC does not have explicit reduction targets for non-CO2 gases. However, planned mitigation measures in the agricultural sector are expected to have an impact on overall methane emissions (see section on Agriculture).
- **Coal exit:** Morocco endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). The country still heavily relies on coal and has one of the most coal-intensive power sectors in the world, with around 600 tonnes of CO2 emitted per GWh in 2020 (World Bank, 2022).
- **100% EVs:** Morocco adopted the electric vehicle (EV) pledge at COP26. While it did not commit to the 2040 target, Morocco agreed to accelerate the proliferation and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. However, the government has yet to release a concrete EV strategy.
- **Forestry:** Morocco signed the Leaders’ declaration on forest and land use at COP26. While its 2021 NDC does not contain specific targets, the Moroccan government recently released the Forests of Morocco 2020–2030 plan (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020a). The strategy set the target to plant 50,000 hectares of new forests across the country every year until 2030.

## Energy supply

Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Morocco still heavily relies on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived from coal (IRENA, 2022a). The Moroccan government has until recently continued to invest in the expansion of existing coal infrastructure, with total generating capacity amounting to 4 GW in 2021 (World Bank, 2022). For example, the extension of the Jorf Lasfar Coal Park, a 2.05 GW coal capacity storage park, was commissioned in 2022 (Calik, 2022b).

Morocco has also taken steps to extend the lifetime of several coal plants. In January 2020, the Moroccan Electricity and Water Utility Company, also known as ONEE, extended its power purchasing agreement (PPA) at the same power plant by another 17 years — from 2027 to 2044 (Industry Projects & Technology, 2020).

Morocco has endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit pledge at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants. However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). Power generation needs to be decarbonised well before 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature goal. Coal, in particular, needs to be phased out from power generation worldwide by around 2030 in pathways that limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2022).

Fossil gas plays an increasing role in Morocco’s energy system. In 2017, fossil gas accounted for 18% of Morocco’s total electricity generation (IEA, 2019), and the government intends to further expand fossil gas generated power.

In 2022, the Moroccan government unveiled plans to build four LNG ports, including transport and storage facilities (Gómez, 2022). This announcement came after Algeria halted gas supply via the Maghreb–Europe pipeline, amid diplomatic tensions between the two countries (S&P Global, 2022). To make up for the shortfall, the government decided to start importing LNG from global markets via Spain. Since Morocco doesn’t have any LNG terminals, shipments are sent to Spain to be degasified, then back to Morocco via the same Maghreb–Europe pipeline (L’Opinion, 2023).

With a view to reducing its reliance on gas imports, Morocco has recently opened its the door to offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022). However, to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas exploration and production.

Morocco’s 2021 NDC also sets out plans to build additional combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, which would amount to 450 MW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a).

Morocco’s renewable energy target is the core of its current emissions reduction efforts. The country’s renewable energy capacity amounted to 3.5 GW in 2021. The government set the target to extend the share of renewable electricity capacity to 42% by 2020 and to 52% by 2030 (made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydropower) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016a, 2021a).

Morocco began renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down. While, in absolute terms, renewable energy capacity doubled between 2015 and 2020 (IRENA, 2021), it was not enough to reach the government’s 2020 target. Renewable energy only amounted to 30% of Morocco’s electricity capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2022b). This was partly due to an even higher increase in the share of non-renewable energy capacity in the same period. It should also be noted that aside from wind power, no additional renewable energy capacity was built in 2019 or 2020 (IRENA, 2022a).

However, renewable energy remains the pillar of Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts. On 21 December 2021, the Moroccan government published its Long-Term Strategy, committing to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Government of Morocco, 2021b). Morocco will need to considerably increase the rollout of renewable projects to meet its targets.

Solar power is the main pillar of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy, largely because of the country’s high solar energy potential. The 2030 National Solar Plan, which is included in the 2021 NDC, now aims to reach a total capacity equivalent to 4 GW by 2030.

The 2020 national Solar Plan initially aimed to increase installed solar power capacity (PV and CSP) to 2 GW by 2020. However, the government failed to achieve its target, with installed solar power capacity only amounting to 0.7 MW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). Despite this, the Moroccan government decided to set new, more ambitious targets.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) is at the forefront of the government’s efforts to scale up renewable energy capacity in the country (a role previously assumed by ONEE). MASEN currently oversees the roll out of several solar power projects. However, several key projects were delayed, casting doubts over Morocco’s capacity to reach the targets it set for itself in the 2030 National Solar Plan.

In May 2019, MASEN announced it had awarded the contract for the 800 MW Noor Midelt project. However, the solar plant, which was meant to be completed by 2022, will only start operating in 2024 (Bellini, 2019; Calik, 2022a).

According to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, installed solar power capacity should increase by 0.8 GW in 2023, as several projects are expected to start operations before the end of the year. On top of that, Morocco plans to add 1 GW of installed capacity in 2024 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023c).

As part of the 2030 National wind plan, Morocco currently aims to reach a total wind power capacity of 2.2 GW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). To that end, four wind farms are planned to start operating in 2023 and 2024 (Calik, 2022a). An additional 10 wind power projects are expected to start in the 2022–2025 period, with a total capacity over 900 MW (Calik, 2022a; Kingdom of Morocco, 2023a).

In a 2019 report the World Bank highlighted Morocco’s considerable offshore wind energy potential, which it estimated could amount to 200 GW (22 GW fixed and 178 GW floating) (World Bank, 2019).

In the Morocco Integrated Wind Energy Program, the government initially aimed to increase wind farm capacity from 800 MW in 2015 to 2 GW by 2020 (Government of Morocco, 2016a). Despite steady progress, Morocco did not reach its target, with the country’s installed wind power capacity only amounting to 1.4 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). However, it should be noted that wind power is the only renewable energy source in Morocco which was further expanded in 2019 and 2020, reaching a total capacity of 1435 MW in 2021 (IRENA, 2022c). This programme is assumed to be part of the current policy projections since its implementation is on track.

As of 2021, Morocco’s installed hydropower capacity totalled 1.8 GW (IRENA, 2022c). In its updated NDC, the government set the goal of installing an additional 1.1 GW of hydropower capacity by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). Three pumped storage hydropower plants are under construction, each with a capacity of 300 MW. They are expected to start operating between 2027 and 2029 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023b).

Morocco’s vast renewable energy potential makes it attractive as a potential supplier of green hydrogen (Finance News Hebdo, 2021). The government intends to invest in green hydrogen to consolidate its energy transition and support decarbonisation efforts in other countries.

In 2021, the Moroccan National Hydrogen Commission unveiled a new roadmap, which expects demand for green hydrogen to reach between 14 TWh and 30 TWh by 2030, and between 156 TWh and 307 TWh by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b). The government estimates that this would require an additional 2 GW in renewable energy sources. Morocco would therefore need to focus its efforts on increasing renewable energy generation, if it hopes to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

The roadmap estimates that development of green hydrogen could lead to between 10 MtCO2e to 20 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b).


## Industry

Morocco is one of the world’s leading exporters of phosphate, which, together with cement, accounts for more than three quarters of total emissions from the industry sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

Morocco’s Third Biennial Report submitted to the UNFCCC spells out several mitigation measures in the phosphate sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). If all these policies are implemented, cumulative avoided emission could amount to 41 MtCO2e between 2020 and 2030. These include the following:

- Covering all electricity needs of the industry with renewable energy sources and cogeneration
- Substituting 30% of the fuel oil used for phosphate drying by solar energy (starting in 2028)
- Implementing a carbon capture and utilisation project from phosphate stacks in 2024 (with a capture rate of 20% to reach 100% in 2028)

## Transport

The transport sector accounts for 38% of Morocco’s total final energy consumption (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). In recent years, the Moroccan government has sought to expand and improve its public transportation system. In November 2018, Morocco inaugurated a high-speed train line connecting the capital Rabat to Tangier and Casablanca (AFD, 2018).

Several projects are currently underway. While the Rabat Salé Tramway Company announced the finalisation of an extension in Rabat in February 2022 (TramwayRS, 2022), Casablanca Transport is currently extending two new tramway lines (Railway Pro, 2021; Moovit, 2022). The government also plans to expand the tramways in Rabat and Casablanca by 2025. Similar extensions are planned in the cities of Marrakech, Fez, Tangier and Agadir, although actual implementation has yet to start.

From January 2023, Morocco put in place Euro 6 vehicle emissions standards, which tighten limits on air pollutant emissions, to all new vehicles sold in the Moroccan market (Le Matin, 2021).

Through its National Energy Efficiency Strategy, the Moroccan government is seeking to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of its economy. Morocco currently aims for a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

The market share of electric vehicles (EV) remains extremely low, but the Moroccan government has taken steps to increase their uptake. It installed charging stations on the highway between Tangier and Agadir. An EV plant was recently built in the city of Kenitra, making Morocco the first North African country with the capacity to produce EVs (Tanchum, 2021). The government has also announced plans to build an electric battery factory in the Casablanca region (Ortiz, 2022).

Morocco’s Exemplary Administration Plan aims to have 30% of the government’s state fleet be ecological vehicles (hybrid or electric) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, the government has yet to set up concrete national targets or release an EV strategy.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is an important component of the Moroccan economy, representing 12.5% of GDP and employing 37% of its workforce (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). It is also the second largest emitting sector in Morocco, accounting for 23% of all emissions in 2018 (excluding LULUCF). The agriculture sector emitted around 18 MtCO2e in 2010 and 20 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022). The main source of emissions is agricultural land (52.5% in 2018), followed by enteric fermentation (39,6% in 2018) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

In 2020, the government set out its new agricultural policy in the Green Generation Strategy 2020-2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Agricultural, Fisheries, Rural Development, 2020), replacing the previous Morocco Green Plan. The new strategy aims to double the share of the agricultural sector in Morocco’s GDP and create 350,000 new jobs.

There is a limited number of policies targeted at climate change mitigation in this sector, as the plan mostly focuses on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The mitigation measures mostly consist of increasing plantations (e.g. of olive and citrus trees, date palms, cactus etc.), preventing soil erosion and developing solar water pumping systems (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, no information on the state of their implementation is currently available.

The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions excl. LULUCF for the period 1990–2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2022). LULUCF values up to 2000 were taken from Morocco’s First Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016b), while values after 2000 were taken from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).


## NDC and other targets

Morocco’s NDC targets apply to all sectors. In the CAT, we exclude LULUCF from the NDC target calculations. As Morocco’s new pledge only provides economy-wide business-as-usual (BAU) values, we have taken BAU LULUCF values for 2030 from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a), and deducted these from the economy-wide 2030 BAU scenario presented in the NDC. We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target.

In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a). The BAU provided by Morocco only considers mitigation measures in place before 2010, which is used as the base year.

In the two documents mentioned above, Morocco has put forward a detailed list of mitigation measures it will implement to reach its 2030 target, separated into conditional and unconditional measures (i.e., measures to be achieved with and without international financial support). There is little information on their state of implementation. However, despite initial delays, Morocco is ramping up efforts to meet its ambitious renewable energy target. As such, we believe Morocco is still on track to meet its 2030 targets.

For the lower end of the current policy scenario, we start by determining the value for 2030, using the 2030 BAU minus the unconditional and conditional mitigation potentials. We then interpolate between 2021-2030, assuming Morocco could still catch up to reach the 2030 mitigation level (Morocco is already delayed on their mitigation trajectory in 2020-2021).

For the upper end of the current policy scenario, we use the same approach but deduct the unconditional mitigation potential only from the BAU trajectory. There are still uncertainties regarding the extent of climate finance Morocco will receive, and therefore the mitigation measures they will be able to put in place.

We also excluded the LULUCF related measures planned the in the agricultural in the current policies projection.

It should be noted that plans to ramp up gas and start offshore extraction are not taken into account in the policy projections. Additionally, it is unclear what impact lifetime extension of existing coal fired power plants will have on the CPP range, as there is no information on what is exactly taken into account in the BAU provided by Morocco.


## Global Warming Potentials values

Morocco previously used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). In the 2021 NDC and the other documents submitted to UNFCCC, GWP are communicated using the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) values. The CAT reports all results using AR4 GWP.


# Targets


## Target Overview

Morocco submitted its latest NDC update to the UNFCCC in July 2021, strengthening its initial pledge. The updated target includes an unconditional emissions reduction of 18.3% below BAU by 2030, up from a 17% reduction in the previous NDC. Thanks to an updated BAU scenario, this new target translates to an absolute emissions level that is 21% lower than the previous target—from 145 MtCO2e in the 2016 submission to 118 MtCO2e in the latest one (excluding LULUCF).

The conditional target was strengthened to 45% below BAU by 2030, up from a 42% reduction target in the first NDC. We estimate this would translate to an absolute emissions level of 84 MtCO2e by 2030. The CAT rates Morocco’s target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways and when rated against the fair share contribution.

Morocco is on track to meet its unconditional target by 2030. However, it will only achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented.

In December 2021, Morocco submitted its long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, in which it committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). In its LTS, Morocco also stated it will explore scenarios to achieve net zero emissions . The government intends to consider scenarios based on sectoral analysis to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. However, a concrete plan has yet to be released.

Morocco has not submitted a new NDC since COP26 despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27.On 8 November 2021, the disputed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) published an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) for Western Sahara. It should be noted that the CAT only took into account the NDC provided by the Moroccan government and does not cover the iNDC, as SADR is not a party to the UNFCCC. It remains unclear to what extent Morocco’s planned mitigation measures, in particular in the renewable energy sector, will also be implemented in the disputed Western Sahara region.


## NDC updates

Morocco’s updated NDC, submitted on 22 June 2021, strengthened its 2030 target, improving it in two ways. First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 compared to the first NDC submission, and 29% for the conditional target.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 22.07.2021 – Morocco leads the way with a new, more ambitious NDC.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Morocco will need support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Morocco has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). As of March 2023, a concrete plan and timeline have yet to be released.

Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target. We will do so once further information is communicated.


# Summary


## Overview

**Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”.**

Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC.

Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include:

- A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26
- The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector
- The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector
To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could:

- Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community
- Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement
- Stop investing in coal and fossil gas
The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration.

These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all.

The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target.

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress.

However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets.

The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a).

Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**.

In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. As of March 2023, however, the government has neither announced a specific net-zero target year nor any other more detailed information.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information will be communicated.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Morocco does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.
- **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to use international offset credit to meet its tentative net zero target.
- **Legal status** – Morocco has stated its intention to set a net-zero target in its 2021 LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Morocco provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures. However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it will provide sectoral analysis to evaluate the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality within the century.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Morocco provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that, under current policies, Morocco’s emissions would reach 88 – 125 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. This means that Morocco is likely to meet its unconditional target (i.e., target to be achieved without international financial support) by 2030. However, Morocco will only be able to achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented. The international community will therefore need to provide financial support to help Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts.

Renewable energy targets are driving Morocco’s current emission reduction efforts. Despite its failure to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, Morocco decided to put forward an even more ambitious plan. It currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. In December 2021, Morocco submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, where it further committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050.

Despite delays in building several key solar power plants, Morocco is ramping up efforts to increase renewable energy capacity with many projects on track to start before 2025. However, considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to keep increasing the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target.

Morocco is also seeking to decarbonise other key sectors of its economy, including the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector. The government also recently released a roadmap highlighting how green hydrogen could consolidate Morocco’s energy transition while supporting decarbonisation efforts in other countries. Increasing renewable energy generation will therefore be crucial to help position Morocco itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

Despite these ambitious planned policies, Morocco still relies heavily on coal and has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure, casting doubt over the country’s ability to achieve its NDC target. Continued reliance on coal and further gas expansion risks locking the country into a high-carbon pathway.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Morocco signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane represented 16% of total emissions (including LULUCF) in 2018 and is mainly concentrated in the agricultural and waste sectors (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). Morocco’s 2021 NDC does not have explicit reduction targets for non-CO2 gases. However, planned mitigation measures in the agricultural sector are expected to have an impact on overall methane emissions (see section on Agriculture).
- **Coal exit:** Morocco endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). The country still heavily relies on coal and has one of the most coal-intensive power sectors in the world, with around 600 tonnes of CO2 emitted per GWh in 2020 (World Bank, 2022).
- **100% EVs:** Morocco adopted the electric vehicle (EV) pledge at COP26. While it did not commit to the 2040 target, Morocco agreed to accelerate the proliferation and adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. However, the government has yet to release a concrete EV strategy.
- **Forestry:** Morocco signed the Leaders’ declaration on forest and land use at COP26. While its 2021 NDC does not contain specific targets, the Moroccan government recently released the Forests of Morocco 2020–2030 plan (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020a). The strategy set the target to plant 50,000 hectares of new forests across the country every year until 2030.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** Morocco has not joined the “Beyond Oil & Gas” initiative to end oil and gas exploration and production. In 2022, the government has announced plans to start offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022)

## Energy supply

Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Morocco still heavily relies on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived from coal (IRENA, 2022a). The Moroccan government has until recently continued to invest in the expansion of existing coal infrastructure, with total generating capacity amounting to 4 GW in 2021 (World Bank, 2022). For example, the extension of the Jorf Lasfar Coal Park, a 2.05 GW coal capacity storage park, was commissioned in 2022 (Calik, 2022b).

Morocco has also taken steps to extend the lifetime of several coal plants. In January 2020, the Moroccan Electricity and Water Utility Company, also known as ONEE, extended its power purchasing agreement (PPA) at the same power plant by another 17 years — from 2027 to 2044 (Industry Projects & Technology, 2020).

Morocco has endorsed clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the coal exit pledge at COP26, agreeing to cease permit issuance or construction of new coal-fired plants. However, it has not committed to the coal phase-out by 2040 (clause 2). Power generation needs to be decarbonised well before 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature goal. Coal, in particular, needs to be phased out from power generation worldwide by around 2030 in pathways that limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2022).

Fossil gas plays an increasing role in Morocco’s energy system. In 2017, fossil gas accounted for 18% of Morocco’s total electricity generation (IEA, 2019), and the government intends to further expand fossil gas generated power.

In 2022, the Moroccan government unveiled plans to build four LNG ports, including transport and storage facilities (Gómez, 2022). This announcement came after Algeria halted gas supply via the Maghreb–Europe pipeline, amid diplomatic tensions between the two countries (S&P Global, 2022). To make up for the shortfall, the government decided to start importing LNG from global markets via Spain. Since Morocco doesn’t have any LNG terminals, shipments are sent to Spain to be degasified, then back to Morocco via the same Maghreb–Europe pipeline (L’Opinion, 2023).

With a view to reducing its reliance on gas imports, Morocco has recently opened its the door to offshore fossil gas exploration (Maroc Diplomatique, 2022). However, to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas exploration and production.

Morocco’s 2021 NDC also sets out plans to build additional combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, which would amount to 450 MW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a).

Morocco’s renewable energy target is the core of its current emissions reduction efforts. The country’s renewable energy capacity amounted to 3.5 GW in 2021. The government set the target to extend the share of renewable electricity capacity to 42% by 2020 and to 52% by 2030 (made up of 20% solar, 20% wind and 12% hydropower) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016a, 2021a).

Morocco began renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down. While, in absolute terms, renewable energy capacity doubled between 2015 and 2020 (IRENA, 2021), it was not enough to reach the government’s 2020 target. Renewable energy only amounted to 30% of Morocco’s electricity capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2022b). This was partly due to an even higher increase in the share of non-renewable energy capacity in the same period. It should also be noted that aside from wind power, no additional renewable energy capacity was built in 2019 or 2020 (IRENA, 2022a).

However, renewable energy remains the pillar of Morocco’s decarbonisation efforts. On 21 December 2021, the Moroccan government published its Long-Term Strategy, committing to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Government of Morocco, 2021b). Morocco will need to considerably increase the rollout of renewable projects to meet its targets.

Solar power is the main pillar of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy, largely because of the country’s high solar energy potential. The 2030 National Solar Plan, which is included in the 2021 NDC, now aims to reach a total capacity equivalent to 4 GW by 2030.

The 2020 national Solar Plan initially aimed to increase installed solar power capacity (PV and CSP) to 2 GW by 2020. However, the government failed to achieve its target, with installed solar power capacity only amounting to 0.7 MW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). Despite this, the Moroccan government decided to set new, more ambitious targets.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) is at the forefront of the government’s efforts to scale up renewable energy capacity in the country (a role previously assumed by ONEE). MASEN currently oversees the roll out of several solar power projects. However, several key projects were delayed, casting doubts over Morocco’s capacity to reach the targets it set for itself in the 2030 National Solar Plan.

In May 2019, MASEN announced it had awarded the contract for the 800 MW Noor Midelt project. However, the solar plant, which was meant to be completed by 2022, will only start operating in 2024 (Bellini, 2019; Calik, 2022a).

According to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, installed solar power capacity should increase by 0.8 GW in 2023, as several projects are expected to start operations before the end of the year. On top of that, Morocco plans to add 1 GW of installed capacity in 2024 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023c).

As part of the 2030 National wind plan, Morocco currently aims to reach a total wind power capacity of 2.2 GW by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). To that end, four wind farms are planned to start operating in 2023 and 2024 (Calik, 2022a). An additional 10 wind power projects are expected to start in the 2022–2025 period, with a total capacity over 900 MW (Calik, 2022a; Kingdom of Morocco, 2023a).

In a 2019 report the World Bank highlighted Morocco’s considerable offshore wind energy potential, which it estimated could amount to 200 GW (22 GW fixed and 178 GW floating) (World Bank, 2019).

In the Morocco Integrated Wind Energy Program, the government initially aimed to increase wind farm capacity from 800 MW in 2015 to 2 GW by 2020 (Government of Morocco, 2016a). Despite steady progress, Morocco did not reach its target, with the country’s installed wind power capacity only amounting to 1.4 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022c). However, it should be noted that wind power is the only renewable energy source in Morocco which was further expanded in 2019 and 2020, reaching a total capacity of 1435 MW in 2021 (IRENA, 2022c). This programme is assumed to be part of the current policy projections since its implementation is on track.

As of 2021, Morocco’s installed hydropower capacity totalled 1.8 GW (IRENA, 2022c). In its updated NDC, the government set the goal of installing an additional 1.1 GW of hydropower capacity by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). Three pumped storage hydropower plants are under construction, each with a capacity of 300 MW. They are expected to start operating between 2027 and 2029 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2023b).

Morocco’s vast renewable energy potential makes it attractive as a potential supplier of green hydrogen (Finance News Hebdo, 2021). The government intends to invest in green hydrogen to consolidate its energy transition and support decarbonisation efforts in other countries.

In 2021, the Moroccan National Hydrogen Commission unveiled a new roadmap, which expects demand for green hydrogen to reach between 14 TWh and 30 TWh by 2030, and between 156 TWh and 307 TWh by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b). The government estimates that this would require an additional 2 GW in renewable energy sources. Morocco would therefore need to focus its efforts on increasing renewable energy generation, if it hopes to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.

The roadmap estimates that development of green hydrogen could lead to between 10 MtCO2e to 20 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021b).


## Industry

Morocco is one of the world’s leading exporters of phosphate, which, together with cement, accounts for more than three quarters of total emissions from the industry sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

Morocco’s Third Biennial Report submitted to the UNFCCC spells out several mitigation measures in the phosphate sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). If all these policies are implemented, cumulative avoided emission could amount to 41 MtCO2e between 2020 and 2030. These include the following:

- Covering all electricity needs of the industry with renewable energy sources and cogeneration
- Substituting 30% of the fuel oil used for phosphate drying by solar energy (starting in 2028)
- Implementing a carbon capture and utilisation project from phosphate stacks in 2024 (with a capture rate of 20% to reach 100% in 2028)

## Transport

The transport sector accounts for 38% of Morocco’s total final energy consumption (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b). In recent years, the Moroccan government has sought to expand and improve its public transportation system. In November 2018, Morocco inaugurated a high-speed train line connecting the capital Rabat to Tangier and Casablanca (AFD, 2018).

Several projects are currently underway. While the Rabat Salé Tramway Company announced the finalisation of an extension in Rabat in February 2022 (TramwayRS, 2022), Casablanca Transport is currently extending two new tramway lines (Railway Pro, 2021; Moovit, 2022). The government also plans to expand the tramways in Rabat and Casablanca by 2025. Similar extensions are planned in the cities of Marrakech, Fez, Tangier and Agadir, although actual implementation has yet to start.

From January 2023, Morocco put in place Euro 6 vehicle emissions standards, which tighten limits on air pollutant emissions, to all new vehicles sold in the Moroccan market (Le Matin, 2021).

Through its National Energy Efficiency Strategy, the Moroccan government is seeking to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of its economy. Morocco currently aims for a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

The market share of electric vehicles (EV) remains extremely low, but the Moroccan government has taken steps to increase their uptake. It installed charging stations on the highway between Tangier and Agadir. An EV plant was recently built in the city of Kenitra, making Morocco the first North African country with the capacity to produce EVs (Tanchum, 2021). The government has also announced plans to build an electric battery factory in the Casablanca region (Ortiz, 2022).

Morocco’s Exemplary Administration Plan aims to have 30% of the government’s state fleet be ecological vehicles (hybrid or electric) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, the government has yet to set up concrete national targets or release an EV strategy.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is an important component of the Moroccan economy, representing 12.5% of GDP and employing 37% of its workforce (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). It is also the second largest emitting sector in Morocco, accounting for 23% of all emissions in 2018 (excluding LULUCF). The agriculture sector emitted around 18 MtCO2e in 2010 and 20 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022). The main source of emissions is agricultural land (52.5% in 2018), followed by enteric fermentation (39,6% in 2018) (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b).

In 2020, the government set out its new agricultural policy in the Green Generation Strategy 2020-2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Agricultural, Fisheries, Rural Development, 2020), replacing the previous Morocco Green Plan. The new strategy aims to double the share of the agricultural sector in Morocco’s GDP and create 350,000 new jobs.

There is a limited number of policies targeted at climate change mitigation in this sector, as the plan mostly focuses on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The mitigation measures mostly consist of increasing plantations (e.g. of olive and citrus trees, date palms, cactus etc.), preventing soil erosion and developing solar water pumping systems (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021a). However, no information on the state of their implementation is currently available.

The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions excl. LULUCF for the period 1990–2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2022). LULUCF values up to 2000 were taken from Morocco’s First Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2016b), while values after 2000 were taken from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).


## NDC and other targets

Morocco’s NDC targets apply to all sectors. In the CAT, we exclude LULUCF from the NDC target calculations. As Morocco’s new pledge only provides economy-wide business-as-usual (BAU) values, we have taken BAU LULUCF values for 2030 from the Fourth National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a), and deducted these from the economy-wide 2030 BAU scenario presented in the NDC. We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target.

In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a). The BAU provided by Morocco only considers mitigation measures in place before 2010, which is used as the base year.

In the two documents mentioned above, Morocco has put forward a detailed list of mitigation measures it will implement to reach its 2030 target, separated into conditional and unconditional measures (i.e., measures to be achieved with and without international financial support). There is little information on their state of implementation. However, despite initial delays, Morocco is ramping up efforts to meet its ambitious renewable energy target. As such, we believe Morocco is still on track to meet its 2030 targets.

For the lower end of the current policy scenario, we start by determining the value for 2030, using the 2030 BAU minus the unconditional and conditional mitigation potentials. We then interpolate between 2021-2030, assuming Morocco could still catch up to reach the 2030 mitigation level (Morocco is already delayed on their mitigation trajectory in 2020-2021).

For the upper end of the current policy scenario, we use the same approach but deduct the unconditional mitigation potential only from the BAU trajectory. There are still uncertainties regarding the extent of climate finance Morocco will receive, and therefore the mitigation measures they will be able to put in place.

We also excluded the LULUCF related measures planned the in the agricultural in the current policies projection.

It should be noted that plans to ramp up gas and start offshore extraction are not taken into account in the policy projections. Additionally, it is unclear what impact lifetime extension of existing coal fired power plants will have on the CPP range, as there is no information on what is exactly taken into account in the BAU provided by Morocco.


## Global Warming Potentials values

Morocco previously used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). In the 2021 NDC and the other documents submitted to UNFCCC, GWP are communicated using the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) values. The CAT reports all results using AR4 GWP.


# Targets


## Target Overview

Morocco submitted its latest NDC update to the UNFCCC in July 2021, strengthening its initial pledge. The updated target includes an unconditional emissions reduction of 18.3% below BAU by 2030, up from a 17% reduction in the previous NDC. Thanks to an updated BAU scenario, this new target translates to an absolute emissions level that is 21% lower than the previous target—from 145 MtCO2e in the 2016 submission to 118 MtCO2e in the latest one (excluding LULUCF).

The conditional target was strengthened to 45% below BAU by 2030, up from a 42% reduction target in the first NDC. We estimate this would translate to an absolute emissions level of 84 MtCO2e by 2030. The CAT rates Morocco’s target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways and when rated against the fair share contribution.

Morocco is on track to meet its unconditional target by 2030. However, it will only achieve its conditional target if all planned policies are implemented.

In December 2021, Morocco submitted its long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, in which it committed to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 80% by 2050 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). In its LTS, Morocco also stated it will explore scenarios to achieve net zero emissions . The government intends to consider scenarios based on sectoral analysis to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. However, a concrete plan has yet to be released.

Morocco has not submitted a new NDC since COP26 despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27.On 8 November 2021, the disputed Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) published an indicative Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) for Western Sahara. It should be noted that the CAT only took into account the NDC provided by the Moroccan government and does not cover the iNDC, as SADR is not a party to the UNFCCC. It remains unclear to what extent Morocco’s planned mitigation measures, in particular in the renewable energy sector, will also be implemented in the disputed Western Sahara region.


## NDC updates

Morocco’s updated NDC, submitted on 22 June 2021, strengthened its 2030 target, improving it in two ways. First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 compared to the first NDC submission, and 29% for the conditional target.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 22.07.2021 – Morocco leads the way with a new, more ambitious NDC.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Morocco will need support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Morocco has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). As of March 2023, a concrete plan and timeline have yet to be released.

Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate Morocco’s net zero target. We will do so once further information is communicated.
