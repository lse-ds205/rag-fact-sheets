# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The Philippines has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies, using its own resources, to close the gap between its fair share and current policies, but will also need international support to implement policies for 1.5°C compatibility.


## Policy overview

Emissions are expected to continue to increase throughout the decade, after a short drop due to the impacts of the pandemic. We estimate that emissions will reach 340-357 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF) under current policies. The Philippines is therefore on track to meet and exceed its unconditional target (384 MtCO2e) without taking additional measures, but is far off track from its ambitious conditional target (96 MtCO2e).

Historically, the energy sector has driven emissions growth in the Philippines. In October 2020, then Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi announced a moratorium on new coal fired power plants, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020b).

The Philippines Energy Plan (PEP) (2020-2040), published in 2021, sets out the government’s current plans for the sector. It includes an additional 2.6 GW of coal power to be added by 2025, but much of the former coal pipeline has now been replaced by fossil gas (see the Energy Supply section below for details).

The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on updating the PEP and will expand the time horizon from 2040 to 2050 (Power Philippines News, 2023c). The DOE also plans to integrate hydrogen and ammonia into the energy roadmap and explore harnessing its 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential (Power Philippines News, 2023a). The updated Plan is expected later this year.

The Philippines is also considering whether to revive its nuclear power program, which the CAT does not view as a viable solution to the climate crisis due to its many downsides.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** The Philippines signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane accounted for 83.5 MtCO2e or 33% of emissions excluding LULUCF in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Agriculture accounts for the largest share of methane (61%), followed by waste (24%) and energy (14%). Methane gas coverage is included in the Philippines NDC target, but no explicit methane reduction target is given (Philippines Government, 2021). With methane accounting for 82.5 MtCO2e in 2020 (the pledge reference year), the Philippines would need reduce methane emissions to 58 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet the target.
- **Coal exit:** The Philippines signed the coal exit at COP26, but did not agree to all aspects of the pledge, including stopping issuance of permits for new unabated coal fired power generation projects, despite already having a national coal power moratorium in place (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). Coal is not mentioned in the Philippines’ updated NDC. It continues to play a significant role in the Philippines’ energy mix (see energy section for further details).
- **100% EVs:** The Philippines did not sign the EV pledge at COP26, but it has started to put the regulatory framework in place to support EV uptake in the country. It is considering adopting a 2040 EV stock target of 50%.
- **Forestry:** The Philippines signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The forestry pledge is not mentioned in the NDC, however the NDC target does not include LULUCF, and therefore the Philippines will be relying on real emissions reductions from emissions intensive sectors of the economy.
- **Beyond oil & gas:** The Philippines has not signed up to the Alliance. The Philippines will be reliant on gas imports as three LNG terminals will open in early 2023 (Reuters, 2022a). In 2020, fossil gas represented 19% of power generation (Department of Energy, 2022).

## Energy supply

Security of energy supply is a key issue for the Philippines. Approximately half of the country’s total primary energy supply relies on coal and oil imports (Department of Energy, 2022a). The Philippines has plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023 (Reuters, 2022b). Fossil gas import infrastructure creates more vulnerability to global market price fluctuations, and places the country at particular risk of price increases during the global energy crisis. Fossil gas investment seems misplaced considering the cheaper, cleaner, and domestically sourced alternative that renewable energy can provide.

There are ongoing climate and environmental challenges, such as earthquakes and typhoons that damage power infrastructure, and hydropower supply can be taxed in a longer dry season as the result of effects of El Niño (Rivas, 2019b, 2019a). These challenges are compounded when ensuring power supply over the three power grids across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, and another 132 isolated grids (Fuentes et al., 2020).

Transporting fossil fuels also poses risks. In February, an oil tanker sank off the country's southwest coast, causing significant harm to the lives and livelihoods of residents and the region’s biodiversity (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023). There have been several significant oil spills in the country in the last few decades. Local groups are concerned that the country's fossil gas expansion plans – both in terms of new power plants and the LNG terminals needed to import the fuel to run them – will increase the risk of this type of disaster and further environmental destruction (Cabico, 2023).

Long-term plans to increase renewables can help address these challenges by increasing the indigenous share of energy, and decentralising and diversifying the Philippines’ power mix (Ahmed & Logarta, 2017; Bertheau et al., 2019; Domingo, 2019; Vemuri & Bohn, 2018). These measures can enhance the system’s reliability, and reduce emissions (Cervantes, 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018). If the Philippines couples low carbon development with its energy efficiency goals, it can ensure a more robust power supply for its population.

**Gas**The Philippines plans to meet some of its growing energy demand by significantly increasing its reliance on fossil gas power and build out its LNG infrastructure. As its domestic supply of fossil gas will soon be depleted, it will be reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and undermining its energy security. Fossil gas is not a ‘bridging fuel’ for the transition. It will continue the Philippines’ energy dependence on fossil fuels and risks locking in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure that can become a barrier to moving to zero emissions power (Ahmed, 2020). Analysis indicates that the Philippines needs to phase out fossil gas power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compliant.

About one fifth of the Philippines’ electricity comes from fossil gas. In absolute terms, it plans to almost double the amount generated by 2030, with an additional 150-300% increase by 2040. Fossil gas’ share of the electricity mix will essentially remain constant over the next decade, as demand grows, and will rise to between 27-40% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). The PEP 2020-2040 plans to add an additional 15-21 GW installed capacity of fossil gas by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Compared to the previous 2018-2040 Philippines Energy Plan, fossil gas power generation will increase by 50-100% in 2030. In essence, the Philippines has switched much of its anticipated future coal power with fossil gas.

The Philippines is running out of its domestic supply of fossil gas and thus has begun to build out its LNG import infrastructure to address this shortfall. The country’s sole gas field, Malampaya, will be depleted in the next few years (Power Philippines News, 2023b). The DOE has approved projects to construct seven LNG terminals, three of which are due to begin operations in 2023 (Power Philippines News, 2023b; Reuters, 2022b). The proposed capacity exceeds what is needed and is unlikely to lower electricity costs as expensive coal is replaced with expensive gas (Reynolds, 2022). This rapid scale up of LNG import infrastructure could create USD 14 bn in stranded asset risks (Reynolds, 2021). Many LNG projects have been delayed at an advanced stage of project development, remaining offline due to regulatory delays and face high market risks as renewable energy technology is dispatched (Reynolds, 2021).

**Coal**Coal dominates the Philippines power mix at present and under current plans would continue to play a significant, though slowly diminishing, role until 2040 and beyond, notwithstanding the moratorium on new coal power plants. This continued reliance on coal power poses adverse economic and security risks for the country, in addition to its devasting environmental harm. Analysis suggests that the Philippines needs to phase out coal power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compatible.

Coal represented 57% of the electricity generation mix in 2020. Under current plans, its share will decrease to 45% in 2030 and fall to 23-25% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Yet, as total power generation will grow during this period, the absolute level of coal power generation (and thus emissions) will rise to 2030 and then essentially remain flat or slowly start to fall until 2040.

The Philippines adopted a moratorium on new coal power plants in 2020, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020). Its current plans include an additional 2.6 GW of installed capacity by 2025, but foresees no further additions (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines reliance on coal is a major energy security issue. Around 70% of Philippines coal supply is imported, mainly (97%) from Indonesia (PhilStar, 2022a). In January 2022, Indonesia banned coal exports for the month to secure its own energy supply. The Philippines Foreign Secretary appealed to Indonesia to lift the ban. The ban sent global coal prices higher during the global north’s winter when energy peaks (PhilStar, 2022a)

Power bills continue to increase due to the high reliance on imported coal for power generation and increasing global coal prices (PhilStar, 2022b). The operation of large, inflexible, coal power plants has not shown it can reliably deliver power supply: between March 2019 and September 2021, four major coal power plants registered 14 to 25 outages each, often leading to power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices (Dalusung III & Manansala, 2021). Analysis shows that variable renewable energy can be more reliable and cost effective than coal (Manansala & Lois Tan, 2021).

**Renewables**In the last few years, the Philippines has reinvigorated its policy support for renewable energy, but much greater support is needed for the country to be able to decarbonise its power sector and reverse its slow historic growth trends.

The Philippines fell behind its peers in renewable energy generation in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the Philippines increased its non-hydro renewable energy capacity by just 1.72 GW (Department of Energy, 2022a). This is in stark contrast with many other Asian countries (see chart below comparing Philippines, Indonesia, China, Japan across all renewable energy generation).


### Share of renewable electricity generation

Under the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040, the government aims to reach 35% renewable energy in power generation by 2030 and 50% by 2040. The 2030 target is consistent with both the reference (REF) scenario and clean energy scenario (CES) in the PEP 2020-2040 and equates to 66-68 TWh of renewable energy in 2030, but only the clean energy scenario is consistent with the 2040 target. In 2020, renewables represented 21% of power generation.

In 2021, the Philippines launched its Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), largely as a successor to its Feed-In-Tariff system, to further support the expansion of renewable energy supply (Department of Energy, 2023a). It successfully auctioned 2 GW of renewable capacity in 2022 to be installed between 2023-2025 (Bellini, 2022). Its first auction of 2023 will run from March to June for 11.6 GW of various types of solar power, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy to be installed between 2024-2026 (Crismundo, 2023c). Another auction is planned for the end of 2023 that will include geothermal and hydro power (Crismundo, 2023b). The 13.6 GW that has or is being auctioned to date is roughly in line with the amount of capacity the Philippines had planned to add under its PEP 2020-2040, though it contains significantly more onshore wind than envisaged under that plan.

In May 2022, the World Bank released an offshore wind roadmap for the Philippines (World Bank, 2022). It explored two scenarios – one largely consistent with the country’s current energy plan (PEP 2020-2040) and a high growth scenario. Under the latter scenario, the Philippines could supply 14% of its power needs in 2040 with offshore wind alone and reach 20 GW of installed capacity. For reference, the current clean energy scenario in the PEP envisages just under 12 GW of all types of wind power in 2040. The high growth scenario resulted in greater cost reductions and more jobs than the scenario consistent with the government’s current plans.

Significant upgrades are needed to the transmission network to support this level of offshore wind power. The World Bank also noted that limitations on foreign ownership of RE projects posed a barrier to securing international financing.

The government has started working on its regulatory framework to support offshore wind and is considering it, along with possible green hydrogen production, as part of the energy plan update due to be released later this year (Power Philippines News, 2022, 2023a). In December 2022, the Department of Energy rescinded the limitations on foreign ownership of renewable energy projects, paving the way to greater outside investment (Department of Energy, 2022b).

**Nuclear**The Philippines is considering whether to revive its nuclear power programme. The Bataan Nuclear Power plant was built in the 1980s but was never brought online; instead it was shelved in the aftermath of Chernobyl (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). President Marcos Jr., whose father commissioned the plant during his Presidency, is considering reviving the plant (ABS-CBN News, 2022). Costs to revive the plant range from one to several billion USD (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). The Department of Energy is also considering new reactors, especially small modular reactors with capacities of 50 MW to 300 MW (Cruz, 2023; IAEA, 2022; Mercurio, 2022).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as a solution to the climate crisis due to its inherent risks (accidents, proliferation, etc), high and increasing costs compared to renewable energy alternatives, long construction times, incompatibility with intermittent RE generation, and its vulnerability to environmental and climate extreme events. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, such as typhoons that hit the country every year, and located in the Ring of Fire, exposing it to seismic activity.


## Transport

The Philippines’ transport sector is the country’s third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport accounts for 90% of the transport sector’s final energy consumption, followed by 8% water transport, 2% domestic air travel, <1% railways (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines has started to take important steps to boost its EV market. In 2022, it passed the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) which seeks to create an enabling environment for the development of the national EV industry (Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA), 2022). In January 2023, it issued Executive Order (EO) No. 12 which removes import duties on several types of EVs and suspended taxes on charging and distribution components for the next five years aiming to make EVs more accessible to Filipinos (Philstar, 2023; Executive Order No. 12, s. 2023, 2023; Tresvalles, 2023).

The EV Act includes a stock target for corporate and government fleets of at least 5% initially, gradually increasing to 10%, but does not include a timeline for achieving these goals. The government is expected to flesh out the details of this target and introduce others for all EVs in the Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development (Crismundo, 2023a). The government is considering a 50% EV stock target by 2040, meaning half of all vehicles in circulation will be electric by that time (Velasco, 2023). The Philippines currently has only fractions of a percent of EV in either sales or total stock (Department of Energy, 2023b).

While these developments to support EV uptake in the Philippines are positive, they must be coupled with the rapid decarbonisation of the country’s power sector to achieve the full climate benefits.

Globally, all new passenger vehicles sold should be electric by 2035 and EVs share of the total light duty vehicle stock should be between 65-90% by 2040 to be 1.5°C compatible.

The ‘Build, Build, Build’ programme targets infrastructure development, especially roads and urban mobility. Some noteworthy projects are Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in Cebu and improvements in the BRT system in Manilla (Republic of the Philippines, 2020). Investments in public transport are nonetheless lacking in many major urban centres (Chang et al., 2021). The country’s first subway - in Manila - is expected to partially open in 2025, and be fully operational by 2028 (International Railway Journal, 2022). Higher investments in public infrastructure would support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and lead to air pollution co-benefits.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. National inventory data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000, shrinking to 37 MtCO2e by 2010 (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017). This difference is partly attributed to changes in the definition of forests and the correction of methodological errors. Government projections show that the net sink is expected to decrease further over this decade, eventually turning into a small source (CCC, 2022).

Commodity-driven deforestation is the dominant driver of tree cover loss in the Philippines (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

The Philippines Development Plan 2017-2022 includes strategies to rehabilitate and restore degraded natural resources and protect the fragile ecosystems while improving the welfare of resource-dependent communities (NEDA, 2017b). Some strategies include:

- Complete delineation of final forest limits including production and high value conservation areas as protection forest.
- Reverse the loss of forest cover through sustained rehabilitation of degraded forestlands including critical watersheds and strengthened protection of remaining natural forests.
- Enhance management of Protected Areas and strengthen sustainable management through the issuance of appropriate tenure and management arrangement.
- Strengthen research and development on forest, watershed and biodiversity.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

The historical GHG emissions between 1990 and 2021 are taken from the PRIMAP database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).

For the LULUCF sector, the historical GHG emissions data is taken from UNFCCC database as officially reported by the country for years 1994 and 2000, and 2010 emissions were taken from the government website (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017).


## NDC and other targets

The updated NDC target is based on a cumulative BAU of 3,340.3 MtCO2e for the period of 2020-2030; however, the update does not include any details on how this BAU was calculated. An annual sector by sector breakdown was subsequently published by the Climate Change Commission (CCC, 2022). We use this information as the basis of our calculations.

GWP valuesThe NDC update and CCC document do not mention the Global Warming Potential values used. The CCC has used GWP from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in past stakeholder consultations and so we assume that that is the basis upon which these NDC calculations have been prepared (Climate Change Commission, 2020).

LULUCFThe NDC update and CCC document to not explicitly discuss the role of the land sector in the NDC target. The 3,340.3 MtCO2e cumulative BAU does include LULUCF, the details for which are provided in the CCC’s document. The NDC update describes the target sectoral coverage as ‘agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy’. We take this statement to mean that efforts in the land sector do not fall within the scope of the Philippines’ target. According to the CCC’s figures, the land use represents a small net sink in 2020 (-24 MtCO2e), which will shrink over the course of the decade to become a small source of emissions in 2030 (3.8 MtCO2e).

Target quantificationWe apply the target reductions to the 2030 BAU value provided in the CCC’s document to calculate 2030 emissions including LULUCF. As the CAT excludes LULUCF from its analysis and the Philippines will not rely on LULUCF measures to achieve its NDC target, we subtract the LULUCF BAU emissions (3.8 MtCO2e) to derive the target value excluding LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

We derive our current policies projection from two principle sources: the 8th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook and the new Philippines Energy Plan 2020-2040.

The lower end of the range is based on the APEC reference scenario (APEC, 2022). This scenario is based on recent trends and current policies, however it is guided by an older Philippines Energy Plan 2018-2040 as well as the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the “Build Build Build” Program with energy supply and demand continuing to increase. The APEC reference scenario follows recent trends in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

APEC scenarios only include energy related CO2 data. To calculate remaining GHG emissions, the CAT has combined the APEC scenario with non-CO2 energy data, estimated using a 5-year historical trend, and using the growth rates for non-CO2 data from the US EPA (2019). All projections data was harmonised with the latest historical year.

The upper end of the range is based on the Philippines Energy Plan (2020-2040) reference scenario (Department of Energy, 2022). The PEP 2020-2040 provides emissions for the energy sector, which we add to non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 emissions using the same approach as the lower end (described above).

The PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario includes the current biofuels blending (2% biodiesel, 10% bioethanol) until 2040, 5% electric vehicles uptake by 2040 and current energy efficiency and conservation efforts maintained to 2040.

Both the PEP and APEC scenarios account for the impact of COVID-19.

The current policies and action emissions range accounts for the coal moratorium under the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario. However, there is still an additional 2.6 GW of coal capacity of additional coal capacity added by 2025 in this scenario. Given the uncertainty of the global energy crisis, the CAT accounts for some uncertainty over the moratorium dates.

The APEC reference scenario does not assume coal capacity is capped, and therefore does not anticipate the coal moratorium is maintained. APEC also produce a Carbon Neutral scenario, which does account for the coal moratorium, but the impacts are only seen by 2030. The CAT uses the APEC reference scenario to 2030 and takes the same assumption as the Carbon Neutral scenario that additional capacity may continue to 2030. Other moratoriums have been lifted in the past. The Department of Energy had a moratorium in oil and gas activities in the West Philippines sea, which was lifted for energy security reasons (APEC, 2022).

The PEP 2020-2040 includes a clean energy scenario (CES) based on clean energy targets, so this is not considered under the CAT current policy and actions trajectory or planned policies. However, when applying the same calculations as applied to the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario as mentioned above, the CES scenario falls within the CAT current policies and action range.

For reference, the clean energy scenario assumes a 35% and 50% share of renewable energy in power generation in 2030 and 2040 respectively. It includes a 5% blending for biodiesel from 2022, a 1.5% increase in fossil gas consumption in transport and industry, a 10% penetration of EVs by 2040, 5% energy savings in oil products and electricity by 2040 and 12% reduction in GHG emissions for the NDC.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Please see the NDC section for the assumptions made in calculating that figure.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The Philippines has submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below a cumulative business as usual (BAU) pathway for 2020-2030 (Philippines Government, 2021). Most of this commitment is conditional on international support. A small fraction, 2.71% of the 75% targeted emissions avoidance, is unconditional. The 2021 NDC also refers to an aspirational target to peak emissions by 2030 (Philippines Government, 2021).

The Philippines unconditional target is not ambitious and will not drive real world emissions reductions. The target level, excluding LULUCF, is 8% - 13% above where we project the country’s emissions to be under current policies in 2030. In other words, the Philippines will meet and exceed this target without taking further action. We rate this target against the Philippines’ fair share contribution to achieving the 1.5°C limit and consider it to be “Insufficient”. Following how the Philippines has chosen to express its NDC, an unconditional target of around 34% below BAU (incl. LULUCF) would be consistent with its 1.5°C fair share contribution.

By contrast, the Philippines’ conditional target is ambitious and we rate it as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’ borders and for which the Philippines will need international support to achieve.

The NDC notes that mitigation actions will strengthen the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity. In addition to mitigation actions, research finds that building up adaptive capacity and resilience is crucial for countries vulnerable to climate change, such as the Philippines (Monsod et al., 2021). The scope of the CAT rating does not cover adaptation efforts.


## NDC Updates

The Philippines submitted an updated target in April 2021 (Philippines Government, 2021). Some key information for understanding the nature of the target is missing from both the first NDC and the update, which makes assessing any increase in ambition difficult. We have relied on subsequent material published by the Philippines’ Climate Change Commission to aid our analysis (see Assumptions tab for the full details).

The Philippines updated its conditional target from 70% below an undisclosed business as usual (BAU) emissions trajectory to 75% below a defined cumulative 2020-2030 BAU emissions trajectory of 3,340.3 MtCO2e. The CAT estimates that the updated conditional target equates to 96 MtCO2e in 2030 excl. LULUCF. This target falls within the lower end of the range that the CAT had derived for the first NDC, using our own BAU assumptions.

The updated target is “1.5°C global least cost” compatible when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the country’s borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve this target. It is not on track to achieve this target based on current policies and will need to adopt further measures with international support.

In a positive development, for the first time, the Philippines Government has set an unconditional target in its NDC update. A small fraction, 2.71% of its 75% below BAU target, is unconditional. However, the unconditional target is well above where the country’s emissions are expected to be in 2030 under current policies. As it will not drive real world emission reductions, we do not consider it to have strengthened the country’s ambition and thus classify it as such on our climate target tracker page.

The CAT updated its rating methodology in September 2021. Prior to that date, we only rated government's target against their fair share contribution. Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C.

Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality. Our rating of the Philippines’ first NDC, which only included a conditional target, followed this approach. This target fell within the “1.5°C compatible” range of our former rating system, but was downgraded to “2°C compatible” because of its conditionality. Under the new rating system, conditional targets from developing countries are assessed against the level of reductions needed within their borders, with international support.

As noted above, the Philippines’ updated conditional NDC target is rated as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible based on our updated rating methodology. Unconditional targets continue to be rated against a fair share contribution. We rate the Philippines’ new unconditional target as “Insufficient”. The target would need to be strengthened to around a 34% reduction from BAU, from its 2.71% level, to represent a fair contribution. Country targets are rated as a package – we combine the two target ratings by averaging.

The final element of the NDC update is an aspirational goal to peak emissions by 2030. However, to achieve its conditional target, the Philippines will need to peak emissions as soon as possible and then start cutting them. It will need international support to adopt such measures.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

The Philippines’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve, and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’s border.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve.

The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO2e or below in 2030.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Since our last assessment, for the Philippines' fair share contribution we have changed both what we are rating and the rating itself. Previously, we rated the Philippines as “2°C compatible”, but this rating was given under our old rating system and in relation to its conditional target (the only one it had at the time). The conditional target actually fell in the “1.5°C compatible” range but was downgraded due to its conditionality (see NDC update section above for further details). The Philippines adopted an unconditional target in its updated NDC. We rate this target against a fair share contribution and find it to be “Insufficient”.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

The Philippines does not have a net zero or long-term target.


## 2020 target

The Philippines did not set a 2020 target.


# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.

For further information on the targets the Philippines has adopted, see the Targets tab.


## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The Philippines has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies, using its own resources, to close the gap between its fair share and current policies, but will also need international support to implement policies for 1.5°C compatibility.


## Policy overview

Emissions are expected to continue to increase throughout the decade, after a short drop due to the impacts of the pandemic. We estimate that emissions will reach 340-357 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF) under current policies. The Philippines is therefore on track to meet and exceed its unconditional target (384 MtCO2e) without taking additional measures, but is far off track from its ambitious conditional target (96 MtCO2e).

Historically, the energy sector has driven emissions growth in the Philippines. In October 2020, then Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi announced a moratorium on new coal fired power plants, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020b).

The Philippines Energy Plan (PEP) (2020-2040), published in 2021, sets out the government’s current plans for the sector. It includes an additional 2.6 GW of coal power to be added by 2025, but much of the former coal pipeline has now been replaced by fossil gas (see the Energy Supply section below for details).

The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on updating the PEP and will expand the time horizon from 2040 to 2050 (Power Philippines News, 2023c). The DOE also plans to integrate hydrogen and ammonia into the energy roadmap and explore harnessing its 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential (Power Philippines News, 2023a). The updated Plan is expected later this year.

The Philippines is also considering whether to revive its nuclear power program, which the CAT does not view as a viable solution to the climate crisis due to its many downsides.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** The Philippines signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane accounted for 83.5 MtCO2e or 33% of emissions excluding LULUCF in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Agriculture accounts for the largest share of methane (61%), followed by waste (24%) and energy (14%). Methane gas coverage is included in the Philippines NDC target, but no explicit methane reduction target is given (Philippines Government, 2021). With methane accounting for 82.5 MtCO2e in 2020 (the pledge reference year), the Philippines would need reduce methane emissions to 58 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet the target.
- **Coal exit:** The Philippines signed the coal exit at COP26, but did not agree to all aspects of the pledge, including stopping issuance of permits for new unabated coal fired power generation projects, despite already having a national coal power moratorium in place (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). Coal is not mentioned in the Philippines’ updated NDC. It continues to play a significant role in the Philippines’ energy mix (see energy section for further details).
- **100% EVs:** The Philippines did not sign the EV pledge at COP26, but it has started to put the regulatory framework in place to support EV uptake in the country. It is considering adopting a 2040 EV stock target of 50%.
- **Forestry:** The Philippines signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The forestry pledge is not mentioned in the NDC, however the NDC target does not include LULUCF, and therefore the Philippines will be relying on real emissions reductions from emissions intensive sectors of the economy.
- **Beyond oil & gas:** The Philippines has not signed up to the Alliance. The Philippines will be reliant on gas imports as three LNG terminals will open in early 2023 (Reuters, 2022a). In 2020, fossil gas represented 19% of power generation (Department of Energy, 2022).

## Energy supply

Security of energy supply is a key issue for the Philippines. Approximately half of the country’s total primary energy supply relies on coal and oil imports (Department of Energy, 2022a). The Philippines has plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023 (Reuters, 2022b). Fossil gas import infrastructure creates more vulnerability to global market price fluctuations, and places the country at particular risk of price increases during the global energy crisis. Fossil gas investment seems misplaced considering the cheaper, cleaner, and domestically sourced alternative that renewable energy can provide.

There are ongoing climate and environmental challenges, such as earthquakes and typhoons that damage power infrastructure, and hydropower supply can be taxed in a longer dry season as the result of effects of El Niño (Rivas, 2019b, 2019a). These challenges are compounded when ensuring power supply over the three power grids across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, and another 132 isolated grids (Fuentes et al., 2020).

Transporting fossil fuels also poses risks. In February, an oil tanker sank off the country's southwest coast, causing significant harm to the lives and livelihoods of residents and the region’s biodiversity (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023). There have been several significant oil spills in the country in the last few decades. Local groups are concerned that the country's fossil gas expansion plans – both in terms of new power plants and the LNG terminals needed to import the fuel to run them – will increase the risk of this type of disaster and further environmental destruction (Cabico, 2023).

Long-term plans to increase renewables can help address these challenges by increasing the indigenous share of energy, and decentralising and diversifying the Philippines’ power mix (Ahmed & Logarta, 2017; Bertheau et al., 2019; Domingo, 2019; Vemuri & Bohn, 2018). These measures can enhance the system’s reliability, and reduce emissions (Cervantes, 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018). If the Philippines couples low carbon development with its energy efficiency goals, it can ensure a more robust power supply for its population.

**Gas**The Philippines plans to meet some of its growing energy demand by significantly increasing its reliance on fossil gas power and build out its LNG infrastructure. As its domestic supply of fossil gas will soon be depleted, it will be reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and undermining its energy security. Fossil gas is not a ‘bridging fuel’ for the transition. It will continue the Philippines’ energy dependence on fossil fuels and risks locking in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure that can become a barrier to moving to zero emissions power (Ahmed, 2020). Analysis indicates that the Philippines needs to phase out fossil gas power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compliant.

About one fifth of the Philippines’ electricity comes from fossil gas. In absolute terms, it plans to almost double the amount generated by 2030, with an additional 150-300% increase by 2040. Fossil gas’ share of the electricity mix will essentially remain constant over the next decade, as demand grows, and will rise to between 27-40% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). The PEP 2020-2040 plans to add an additional 15-21 GW installed capacity of fossil gas by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Compared to the previous 2018-2040 Philippines Energy Plan, fossil gas power generation will increase by 50-100% in 2030. In essence, the Philippines has switched much of its anticipated future coal power with fossil gas.

The Philippines is running out of its domestic supply of fossil gas and thus has begun to build out its LNG import infrastructure to address this shortfall. The country’s sole gas field, Malampaya, will be depleted in the next few years (Power Philippines News, 2023b). The DOE has approved projects to construct seven LNG terminals, three of which are due to begin operations in 2023 (Power Philippines News, 2023b; Reuters, 2022b). The proposed capacity exceeds what is needed and is unlikely to lower electricity costs as expensive coal is replaced with expensive gas (Reynolds, 2022). This rapid scale up of LNG import infrastructure could create USD 14 bn in stranded asset risks (Reynolds, 2021). Many LNG projects have been delayed at an advanced stage of project development, remaining offline due to regulatory delays and face high market risks as renewable energy technology is dispatched (Reynolds, 2021).

**Coal**Coal dominates the Philippines power mix at present and under current plans would continue to play a significant, though slowly diminishing, role until 2040 and beyond, notwithstanding the moratorium on new coal power plants. This continued reliance on coal power poses adverse economic and security risks for the country, in addition to its devasting environmental harm. Analysis suggests that the Philippines needs to phase out coal power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compatible.

Coal represented 57% of the electricity generation mix in 2020. Under current plans, its share will decrease to 45% in 2030 and fall to 23-25% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Yet, as total power generation will grow during this period, the absolute level of coal power generation (and thus emissions) will rise to 2030 and then essentially remain flat or slowly start to fall until 2040.

The Philippines adopted a moratorium on new coal power plants in 2020, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020). Its current plans include an additional 2.6 GW of installed capacity by 2025, but foresees no further additions (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines reliance on coal is a major energy security issue. Around 70% of Philippines coal supply is imported, mainly (97%) from Indonesia (PhilStar, 2022a). In January 2022, Indonesia banned coal exports for the month to secure its own energy supply. The Philippines Foreign Secretary appealed to Indonesia to lift the ban. The ban sent global coal prices higher during the global north’s winter when energy peaks (PhilStar, 2022a)

Power bills continue to increase due to the high reliance on imported coal for power generation and increasing global coal prices (PhilStar, 2022b). The operation of large, inflexible, coal power plants has not shown it can reliably deliver power supply: between March 2019 and September 2021, four major coal power plants registered 14 to 25 outages each, often leading to power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices (Dalusung III & Manansala, 2021). Analysis shows that variable renewable energy can be more reliable and cost effective than coal (Manansala & Lois Tan, 2021).

**Renewables**In the last few years, the Philippines has reinvigorated its policy support for renewable energy, but much greater support is needed for the country to be able to decarbonise its power sector and reverse its slow historic growth trends.

The Philippines fell behind its peers in renewable energy generation in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the Philippines increased its non-hydro renewable energy capacity by just 1.72 GW (Department of Energy, 2022a). This is in stark contrast with many other Asian countries (see chart below comparing Philippines, Indonesia, China, Japan across all renewable energy generation).


### Share of renewable electricity generation

Under the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040, the government aims to reach 35% renewable energy in power generation by 2030 and 50% by 2040. The 2030 target is consistent with both the reference (REF) scenario and clean energy scenario (CES) in the PEP 2020-2040 and equates to 66-68 TWh of renewable energy in 2030, but only the clean energy scenario is consistent with the 2040 target. In 2020, renewables represented 21% of power generation.

In 2021, the Philippines launched its Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), largely as a successor to its Feed-In-Tariff system, to further support the expansion of renewable energy supply (Department of Energy, 2023a). It successfully auctioned 2 GW of renewable capacity in 2022 to be installed between 2023-2025 (Bellini, 2022). Its first auction of 2023 will run from March to June for 11.6 GW of various types of solar power, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy to be installed between 2024-2026 (Crismundo, 2023c). Another auction is planned for the end of 2023 that will include geothermal and hydro power (Crismundo, 2023b). The 13.6 GW that has or is being auctioned to date is roughly in line with the amount of capacity the Philippines had planned to add under its PEP 2020-2040, though it contains significantly more onshore wind than envisaged under that plan.

In May 2022, the World Bank released an offshore wind roadmap for the Philippines (World Bank, 2022). It explored two scenarios – one largely consistent with the country’s current energy plan (PEP 2020-2040) and a high growth scenario. Under the latter scenario, the Philippines could supply 14% of its power needs in 2040 with offshore wind alone and reach 20 GW of installed capacity. For reference, the current clean energy scenario in the PEP envisages just under 12 GW of all types of wind power in 2040. The high growth scenario resulted in greater cost reductions and more jobs than the scenario consistent with the government’s current plans.

Significant upgrades are needed to the transmission network to support this level of offshore wind power. The World Bank also noted that limitations on foreign ownership of RE projects posed a barrier to securing international financing.

The government has started working on its regulatory framework to support offshore wind and is considering it, along with possible green hydrogen production, as part of the energy plan update due to be released later this year (Power Philippines News, 2022, 2023a). In December 2022, the Department of Energy rescinded the limitations on foreign ownership of renewable energy projects, paving the way to greater outside investment (Department of Energy, 2022b).

**Nuclear**The Philippines is considering whether to revive its nuclear power programme. The Bataan Nuclear Power plant was built in the 1980s but was never brought online; instead it was shelved in the aftermath of Chernobyl (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). President Marcos Jr., whose father commissioned the plant during his Presidency, is considering reviving the plant (ABS-CBN News, 2022). Costs to revive the plant range from one to several billion USD (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). The Department of Energy is also considering new reactors, especially small modular reactors with capacities of 50 MW to 300 MW (Cruz, 2023; IAEA, 2022; Mercurio, 2022).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as a solution to the climate crisis due to its inherent risks (accidents, proliferation, etc), high and increasing costs compared to renewable energy alternatives, long construction times, incompatibility with intermittent RE generation, and its vulnerability to environmental and climate extreme events. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, such as typhoons that hit the country every year, and located in the Ring of Fire, exposing it to seismic activity.


## Transport

The Philippines’ transport sector is the country’s third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport accounts for 90% of the transport sector’s final energy consumption, followed by 8% water transport, 2% domestic air travel, <1% railways (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines has started to take important steps to boost its EV market. In 2022, it passed the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) which seeks to create an enabling environment for the development of the national EV industry (Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA), 2022). In January 2023, it issued Executive Order (EO) No. 12 which removes import duties on several types of EVs and suspended taxes on charging and distribution components for the next five years aiming to make EVs more accessible to Filipinos (Philstar, 2023; Executive Order No. 12, s. 2023, 2023; Tresvalles, 2023).

The EV Act includes a stock target for corporate and government fleets of at least 5% initially, gradually increasing to 10%, but does not include a timeline for achieving these goals. The government is expected to flesh out the details of this target and introduce others for all EVs in the Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development (Crismundo, 2023a). The government is considering a 50% EV stock target by 2040, meaning half of all vehicles in circulation will be electric by that time (Velasco, 2023). The Philippines currently has only fractions of a percent of EV in either sales or total stock (Department of Energy, 2023b).

While these developments to support EV uptake in the Philippines are positive, they must be coupled with the rapid decarbonisation of the country’s power sector to achieve the full climate benefits.

Globally, all new passenger vehicles sold should be electric by 2035 and EVs share of the total light duty vehicle stock should be between 65-90% by 2040 to be 1.5°C compatible.

The ‘Build, Build, Build’ programme targets infrastructure development, especially roads and urban mobility. Some noteworthy projects are Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in Cebu and improvements in the BRT system in Manilla (Republic of the Philippines, 2020). Investments in public transport are nonetheless lacking in many major urban centres (Chang et al., 2021). The country’s first subway - in Manila - is expected to partially open in 2025, and be fully operational by 2028 (International Railway Journal, 2022). Higher investments in public infrastructure would support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and lead to air pollution co-benefits.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. National inventory data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000, shrinking to 37 MtCO2e by 2010 (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017). This difference is partly attributed to changes in the definition of forests and the correction of methodological errors. Government projections show that the net sink is expected to decrease further over this decade, eventually turning into a small source (CCC, 2022).

Commodity-driven deforestation is the dominant driver of tree cover loss in the Philippines (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

The Philippines Development Plan 2017-2022 includes strategies to rehabilitate and restore degraded natural resources and protect the fragile ecosystems while improving the welfare of resource-dependent communities (NEDA, 2017b). Some strategies include:

- Complete delineation of final forest limits including production and high value conservation areas as protection forest.
- Reverse the loss of forest cover through sustained rehabilitation of degraded forestlands including critical watersheds and strengthened protection of remaining natural forests.
- Enhance management of Protected Areas and strengthen sustainable management through the issuance of appropriate tenure and management arrangement.
- Strengthen research and development on forest, watershed and biodiversity.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

The historical GHG emissions between 1990 and 2021 are taken from the PRIMAP database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).

For the LULUCF sector, the historical GHG emissions data is taken from UNFCCC database as officially reported by the country for years 1994 and 2000, and 2010 emissions were taken from the government website (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017).


## NDC and other targets

The updated NDC target is based on a cumulative BAU of 3,340.3 MtCO2e for the period of 2020-2030; however, the update does not include any details on how this BAU was calculated. An annual sector by sector breakdown was subsequently published by the Climate Change Commission (CCC, 2022). We use this information as the basis of our calculations.

GWP valuesThe NDC update and CCC document do not mention the Global Warming Potential values used. The CCC has used GWP from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in past stakeholder consultations and so we assume that that is the basis upon which these NDC calculations have been prepared (Climate Change Commission, 2020).

LULUCFThe NDC update and CCC document to not explicitly discuss the role of the land sector in the NDC target. The 3,340.3 MtCO2e cumulative BAU does include LULUCF, the details for which are provided in the CCC’s document. The NDC update describes the target sectoral coverage as ‘agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy’. We take this statement to mean that efforts in the land sector do not fall within the scope of the Philippines’ target. According to the CCC’s figures, the land use represents a small net sink in 2020 (-24 MtCO2e), which will shrink over the course of the decade to become a small source of emissions in 2030 (3.8 MtCO2e).

Target quantificationWe apply the target reductions to the 2030 BAU value provided in the CCC’s document to calculate 2030 emissions including LULUCF. As the CAT excludes LULUCF from its analysis and the Philippines will not rely on LULUCF measures to achieve its NDC target, we subtract the LULUCF BAU emissions (3.8 MtCO2e) to derive the target value excluding LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

We derive our current policies projection from two principle sources: the 8th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook and the new Philippines Energy Plan 2020-2040.

The lower end of the range is based on the APEC reference scenario (APEC, 2022). This scenario is based on recent trends and current policies, however it is guided by an older Philippines Energy Plan 2018-2040 as well as the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the “Build Build Build” Program with energy supply and demand continuing to increase. The APEC reference scenario follows recent trends in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

APEC scenarios only include energy related CO2 data. To calculate remaining GHG emissions, the CAT has combined the APEC scenario with non-CO2 energy data, estimated using a 5-year historical trend, and using the growth rates for non-CO2 data from the US EPA (2019). All projections data was harmonised with the latest historical year.

The upper end of the range is based on the Philippines Energy Plan (2020-2040) reference scenario (Department of Energy, 2022). The PEP 2020-2040 provides emissions for the energy sector, which we add to non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 emissions using the same approach as the lower end (described above).

The PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario includes the current biofuels blending (2% biodiesel, 10% bioethanol) until 2040, 5% electric vehicles uptake by 2040 and current energy efficiency and conservation efforts maintained to 2040.

Both the PEP and APEC scenarios account for the impact of COVID-19.

The current policies and action emissions range accounts for the coal moratorium under the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario. However, there is still an additional 2.6 GW of coal capacity of additional coal capacity added by 2025 in this scenario. Given the uncertainty of the global energy crisis, the CAT accounts for some uncertainty over the moratorium dates.

The APEC reference scenario does not assume coal capacity is capped, and therefore does not anticipate the coal moratorium is maintained. APEC also produce a Carbon Neutral scenario, which does account for the coal moratorium, but the impacts are only seen by 2030. The CAT uses the APEC reference scenario to 2030 and takes the same assumption as the Carbon Neutral scenario that additional capacity may continue to 2030. Other moratoriums have been lifted in the past. The Department of Energy had a moratorium in oil and gas activities in the West Philippines sea, which was lifted for energy security reasons (APEC, 2022).

The PEP 2020-2040 includes a clean energy scenario (CES) based on clean energy targets, so this is not considered under the CAT current policy and actions trajectory or planned policies. However, when applying the same calculations as applied to the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario as mentioned above, the CES scenario falls within the CAT current policies and action range.

For reference, the clean energy scenario assumes a 35% and 50% share of renewable energy in power generation in 2030 and 2040 respectively. It includes a 5% blending for biodiesel from 2022, a 1.5% increase in fossil gas consumption in transport and industry, a 10% penetration of EVs by 2040, 5% energy savings in oil products and electricity by 2040 and 12% reduction in GHG emissions for the NDC.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Please see the NDC section for the assumptions made in calculating that figure.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The Philippines has submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below a cumulative business as usual (BAU) pathway for 2020-2030 (Philippines Government, 2021). Most of this commitment is conditional on international support. A small fraction, 2.71% of the 75% targeted emissions avoidance, is unconditional. The 2021 NDC also refers to an aspirational target to peak emissions by 2030 (Philippines Government, 2021).

The Philippines unconditional target is not ambitious and will not drive real world emissions reductions. The target level, excluding LULUCF, is 8% - 13% above where we project the country’s emissions to be under current policies in 2030. In other words, the Philippines will meet and exceed this target without taking further action. We rate this target against the Philippines’ fair share contribution to achieving the 1.5°C limit and consider it to be “Insufficient”. Following how the Philippines has chosen to express its NDC, an unconditional target of around 34% below BAU (incl. LULUCF) would be consistent with its 1.5°C fair share contribution.

By contrast, the Philippines’ conditional target is ambitious and we rate it as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’ borders and for which the Philippines will need international support to achieve.

The NDC notes that mitigation actions will strengthen the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity. In addition to mitigation actions, research finds that building up adaptive capacity and resilience is crucial for countries vulnerable to climate change, such as the Philippines (Monsod et al., 2021). The scope of the CAT rating does not cover adaptation efforts.


## NDC Updates

The Philippines submitted an updated target in April 2021 (Philippines Government, 2021). Some key information for understanding the nature of the target is missing from both the first NDC and the update, which makes assessing any increase in ambition difficult. We have relied on subsequent material published by the Philippines’ Climate Change Commission to aid our analysis (see Assumptions tab for the full details).

The Philippines updated its conditional target from 70% below an undisclosed business as usual (BAU) emissions trajectory to 75% below a defined cumulative 2020-2030 BAU emissions trajectory of 3,340.3 MtCO2e. The CAT estimates that the updated conditional target equates to 96 MtCO2e in 2030 excl. LULUCF. This target falls within the lower end of the range that the CAT had derived for the first NDC, using our own BAU assumptions.

The updated target is “1.5°C global least cost” compatible when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the country’s borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve this target. It is not on track to achieve this target based on current policies and will need to adopt further measures with international support.

In a positive development, for the first time, the Philippines Government has set an unconditional target in its NDC update. A small fraction, 2.71% of its 75% below BAU target, is unconditional. However, the unconditional target is well above where the country’s emissions are expected to be in 2030 under current policies. As it will not drive real world emission reductions, we do not consider it to have strengthened the country’s ambition and thus classify it as such on our climate target tracker page.

The CAT updated its rating methodology in September 2021. Prior to that date, we only rated government's target against their fair share contribution. Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C.

Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality. Our rating of the Philippines’ first NDC, which only included a conditional target, followed this approach. This target fell within the “1.5°C compatible” range of our former rating system, but was downgraded to “2°C compatible” because of its conditionality. Under the new rating system, conditional targets from developing countries are assessed against the level of reductions needed within their borders, with international support.

As noted above, the Philippines’ updated conditional NDC target is rated as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible based on our updated rating methodology. Unconditional targets continue to be rated against a fair share contribution. We rate the Philippines’ new unconditional target as “Insufficient”. The target would need to be strengthened to around a 34% reduction from BAU, from its 2.71% level, to represent a fair contribution. Country targets are rated as a package – we combine the two target ratings by averaging.

The final element of the NDC update is an aspirational goal to peak emissions by 2030. However, to achieve its conditional target, the Philippines will need to peak emissions as soon as possible and then start cutting them. It will need international support to adopt such measures.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

The Philippines’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve, and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’s border.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve.

The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO2e or below in 2030.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Since our last assessment, for the Philippines' fair share contribution we have changed both what we are rating and the rating itself. Previously, we rated the Philippines as “2°C compatible”, but this rating was given under our old rating system and in relation to its conditional target (the only one it had at the time). The conditional target actually fell in the “1.5°C compatible” range but was downgraded due to its conditionality (see NDC update section above for further details). The Philippines adopted an unconditional target in its updated NDC. We rate this target against a fair share contribution and find it to be “Insufficient”.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

The Philippines does not have a net zero or long-term target.


## 2020 target

The Philippines did not set a 2020 target.


# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The Philippines has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies, using its own resources, to close the gap between its fair share and current policies, but will also need international support to implement policies for 1.5°C compatibility.


## Policy overview

Emissions are expected to continue to increase throughout the decade, after a short drop due to the impacts of the pandemic. We estimate that emissions will reach 340-357 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF) under current policies. The Philippines is therefore on track to meet and exceed its unconditional target (384 MtCO2e) without taking additional measures, but is far off track from its ambitious conditional target (96 MtCO2e).

Historically, the energy sector has driven emissions growth in the Philippines. In October 2020, then Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi announced a moratorium on new coal fired power plants, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020b).

The Philippines Energy Plan (PEP) (2020-2040), published in 2021, sets out the government’s current plans for the sector. It includes an additional 2.6 GW of coal power to be added by 2025, but much of the former coal pipeline has now been replaced by fossil gas (see the Energy Supply section below for details).

The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on updating the PEP and will expand the time horizon from 2040 to 2050 (Power Philippines News, 2023c). The DOE also plans to integrate hydrogen and ammonia into the energy roadmap and explore harnessing its 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential (Power Philippines News, 2023a). The updated Plan is expected later this year.

The Philippines is also considering whether to revive its nuclear power program, which the CAT does not view as a viable solution to the climate crisis due to its many downsides.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** The Philippines signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane accounted for 83.5 MtCO2e or 33% of emissions excluding LULUCF in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Agriculture accounts for the largest share of methane (61%), followed by waste (24%) and energy (14%). Methane gas coverage is included in the Philippines NDC target, but no explicit methane reduction target is given (Philippines Government, 2021). With methane accounting for 82.5 MtCO2e in 2020 (the pledge reference year), the Philippines would need reduce methane emissions to 58 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet the target.
- **Coal exit:** The Philippines signed the coal exit at COP26, but did not agree to all aspects of the pledge, including stopping issuance of permits for new unabated coal fired power generation projects, despite already having a national coal power moratorium in place (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). Coal is not mentioned in the Philippines’ updated NDC. It continues to play a significant role in the Philippines’ energy mix (see energy section for further details).
- **100% EVs:** The Philippines did not sign the EV pledge at COP26, but it has started to put the regulatory framework in place to support EV uptake in the country. It is considering adopting a 2040 EV stock target of 50%.
- **Forestry:** The Philippines signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The forestry pledge is not mentioned in the NDC, however the NDC target does not include LULUCF, and therefore the Philippines will be relying on real emissions reductions from emissions intensive sectors of the economy.
- **Beyond oil & gas:** The Philippines has not signed up to the Alliance. The Philippines will be reliant on gas imports as three LNG terminals will open in early 2023 (Reuters, 2022a). In 2020, fossil gas represented 19% of power generation (Department of Energy, 2022).

## Energy supply

Security of energy supply is a key issue for the Philippines. Approximately half of the country’s total primary energy supply relies on coal and oil imports (Department of Energy, 2022a). The Philippines has plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023 (Reuters, 2022b). Fossil gas import infrastructure creates more vulnerability to global market price fluctuations, and places the country at particular risk of price increases during the global energy crisis. Fossil gas investment seems misplaced considering the cheaper, cleaner, and domestically sourced alternative that renewable energy can provide.

There are ongoing climate and environmental challenges, such as earthquakes and typhoons that damage power infrastructure, and hydropower supply can be taxed in a longer dry season as the result of effects of El Niño (Rivas, 2019b, 2019a). These challenges are compounded when ensuring power supply over the three power grids across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, and another 132 isolated grids (Fuentes et al., 2020).

Transporting fossil fuels also poses risks. In February, an oil tanker sank off the country's southwest coast, causing significant harm to the lives and livelihoods of residents and the region’s biodiversity (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023). There have been several significant oil spills in the country in the last few decades. Local groups are concerned that the country's fossil gas expansion plans – both in terms of new power plants and the LNG terminals needed to import the fuel to run them – will increase the risk of this type of disaster and further environmental destruction (Cabico, 2023).

Long-term plans to increase renewables can help address these challenges by increasing the indigenous share of energy, and decentralising and diversifying the Philippines’ power mix (Ahmed & Logarta, 2017; Bertheau et al., 2019; Domingo, 2019; Vemuri & Bohn, 2018). These measures can enhance the system’s reliability, and reduce emissions (Cervantes, 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018). If the Philippines couples low carbon development with its energy efficiency goals, it can ensure a more robust power supply for its population.

**Gas**The Philippines plans to meet some of its growing energy demand by significantly increasing its reliance on fossil gas power and build out its LNG infrastructure. As its domestic supply of fossil gas will soon be depleted, it will be reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and undermining its energy security. Fossil gas is not a ‘bridging fuel’ for the transition. It will continue the Philippines’ energy dependence on fossil fuels and risks locking in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure that can become a barrier to moving to zero emissions power (Ahmed, 2020). Analysis indicates that the Philippines needs to phase out fossil gas power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compliant.

About one fifth of the Philippines’ electricity comes from fossil gas. In absolute terms, it plans to almost double the amount generated by 2030, with an additional 150-300% increase by 2040. Fossil gas’ share of the electricity mix will essentially remain constant over the next decade, as demand grows, and will rise to between 27-40% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). The PEP 2020-2040 plans to add an additional 15-21 GW installed capacity of fossil gas by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Compared to the previous 2018-2040 Philippines Energy Plan, fossil gas power generation will increase by 50-100% in 2030. In essence, the Philippines has switched much of its anticipated future coal power with fossil gas.

The Philippines is running out of its domestic supply of fossil gas and thus has begun to build out its LNG import infrastructure to address this shortfall. The country’s sole gas field, Malampaya, will be depleted in the next few years (Power Philippines News, 2023b). The DOE has approved projects to construct seven LNG terminals, three of which are due to begin operations in 2023 (Power Philippines News, 2023b; Reuters, 2022b). The proposed capacity exceeds what is needed and is unlikely to lower electricity costs as expensive coal is replaced with expensive gas (Reynolds, 2022). This rapid scale up of LNG import infrastructure could create USD 14 bn in stranded asset risks (Reynolds, 2021). Many LNG projects have been delayed at an advanced stage of project development, remaining offline due to regulatory delays and face high market risks as renewable energy technology is dispatched (Reynolds, 2021).

**Coal**Coal dominates the Philippines power mix at present and under current plans would continue to play a significant, though slowly diminishing, role until 2040 and beyond, notwithstanding the moratorium on new coal power plants. This continued reliance on coal power poses adverse economic and security risks for the country, in addition to its devasting environmental harm. Analysis suggests that the Philippines needs to phase out coal power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compatible.

Coal represented 57% of the electricity generation mix in 2020. Under current plans, its share will decrease to 45% in 2030 and fall to 23-25% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Yet, as total power generation will grow during this period, the absolute level of coal power generation (and thus emissions) will rise to 2030 and then essentially remain flat or slowly start to fall until 2040.

The Philippines adopted a moratorium on new coal power plants in 2020, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020). Its current plans include an additional 2.6 GW of installed capacity by 2025, but foresees no further additions (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines reliance on coal is a major energy security issue. Around 70% of Philippines coal supply is imported, mainly (97%) from Indonesia (PhilStar, 2022a). In January 2022, Indonesia banned coal exports for the month to secure its own energy supply. The Philippines Foreign Secretary appealed to Indonesia to lift the ban. The ban sent global coal prices higher during the global north’s winter when energy peaks (PhilStar, 2022a)

Power bills continue to increase due to the high reliance on imported coal for power generation and increasing global coal prices (PhilStar, 2022b). The operation of large, inflexible, coal power plants has not shown it can reliably deliver power supply: between March 2019 and September 2021, four major coal power plants registered 14 to 25 outages each, often leading to power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices (Dalusung III & Manansala, 2021). Analysis shows that variable renewable energy can be more reliable and cost effective than coal (Manansala & Lois Tan, 2021).

**Renewables**In the last few years, the Philippines has reinvigorated its policy support for renewable energy, but much greater support is needed for the country to be able to decarbonise its power sector and reverse its slow historic growth trends.

The Philippines fell behind its peers in renewable energy generation in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the Philippines increased its non-hydro renewable energy capacity by just 1.72 GW (Department of Energy, 2022a). This is in stark contrast with many other Asian countries (see chart below comparing Philippines, Indonesia, China, Japan across all renewable energy generation).


### Share of renewable electricity generation

Under the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040, the government aims to reach 35% renewable energy in power generation by 2030 and 50% by 2040. The 2030 target is consistent with both the reference (REF) scenario and clean energy scenario (CES) in the PEP 2020-2040 and equates to 66-68 TWh of renewable energy in 2030, but only the clean energy scenario is consistent with the 2040 target. In 2020, renewables represented 21% of power generation.

In 2021, the Philippines launched its Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), largely as a successor to its Feed-In-Tariff system, to further support the expansion of renewable energy supply (Department of Energy, 2023a). It successfully auctioned 2 GW of renewable capacity in 2022 to be installed between 2023-2025 (Bellini, 2022). Its first auction of 2023 will run from March to June for 11.6 GW of various types of solar power, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy to be installed between 2024-2026 (Crismundo, 2023c). Another auction is planned for the end of 2023 that will include geothermal and hydro power (Crismundo, 2023b). The 13.6 GW that has or is being auctioned to date is roughly in line with the amount of capacity the Philippines had planned to add under its PEP 2020-2040, though it contains significantly more onshore wind than envisaged under that plan.

In May 2022, the World Bank released an offshore wind roadmap for the Philippines (World Bank, 2022). It explored two scenarios – one largely consistent with the country’s current energy plan (PEP 2020-2040) and a high growth scenario. Under the latter scenario, the Philippines could supply 14% of its power needs in 2040 with offshore wind alone and reach 20 GW of installed capacity. For reference, the current clean energy scenario in the PEP envisages just under 12 GW of all types of wind power in 2040. The high growth scenario resulted in greater cost reductions and more jobs than the scenario consistent with the government’s current plans.

Significant upgrades are needed to the transmission network to support this level of offshore wind power. The World Bank also noted that limitations on foreign ownership of RE projects posed a barrier to securing international financing.

The government has started working on its regulatory framework to support offshore wind and is considering it, along with possible green hydrogen production, as part of the energy plan update due to be released later this year (Power Philippines News, 2022, 2023a). In December 2022, the Department of Energy rescinded the limitations on foreign ownership of renewable energy projects, paving the way to greater outside investment (Department of Energy, 2022b).

**Nuclear**The Philippines is considering whether to revive its nuclear power programme. The Bataan Nuclear Power plant was built in the 1980s but was never brought online; instead it was shelved in the aftermath of Chernobyl (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). President Marcos Jr., whose father commissioned the plant during his Presidency, is considering reviving the plant (ABS-CBN News, 2022). Costs to revive the plant range from one to several billion USD (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). The Department of Energy is also considering new reactors, especially small modular reactors with capacities of 50 MW to 300 MW (Cruz, 2023; IAEA, 2022; Mercurio, 2022).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as a solution to the climate crisis due to its inherent risks (accidents, proliferation, etc), high and increasing costs compared to renewable energy alternatives, long construction times, incompatibility with intermittent RE generation, and its vulnerability to environmental and climate extreme events. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, such as typhoons that hit the country every year, and located in the Ring of Fire, exposing it to seismic activity.


## Transport

The Philippines’ transport sector is the country’s third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport accounts for 90% of the transport sector’s final energy consumption, followed by 8% water transport, 2% domestic air travel, <1% railways (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines has started to take important steps to boost its EV market. In 2022, it passed the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) which seeks to create an enabling environment for the development of the national EV industry (Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA), 2022). In January 2023, it issued Executive Order (EO) No. 12 which removes import duties on several types of EVs and suspended taxes on charging and distribution components for the next five years aiming to make EVs more accessible to Filipinos (Philstar, 2023; Executive Order No. 12, s. 2023, 2023; Tresvalles, 2023).

The EV Act includes a stock target for corporate and government fleets of at least 5% initially, gradually increasing to 10%, but does not include a timeline for achieving these goals. The government is expected to flesh out the details of this target and introduce others for all EVs in the Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development (Crismundo, 2023a). The government is considering a 50% EV stock target by 2040, meaning half of all vehicles in circulation will be electric by that time (Velasco, 2023). The Philippines currently has only fractions of a percent of EV in either sales or total stock (Department of Energy, 2023b).

While these developments to support EV uptake in the Philippines are positive, they must be coupled with the rapid decarbonisation of the country’s power sector to achieve the full climate benefits.

Globally, all new passenger vehicles sold should be electric by 2035 and EVs share of the total light duty vehicle stock should be between 65-90% by 2040 to be 1.5°C compatible.

The ‘Build, Build, Build’ programme targets infrastructure development, especially roads and urban mobility. Some noteworthy projects are Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in Cebu and improvements in the BRT system in Manilla (Republic of the Philippines, 2020). Investments in public transport are nonetheless lacking in many major urban centres (Chang et al., 2021). The country’s first subway - in Manila - is expected to partially open in 2025, and be fully operational by 2028 (International Railway Journal, 2022). Higher investments in public infrastructure would support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and lead to air pollution co-benefits.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. National inventory data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000, shrinking to 37 MtCO2e by 2010 (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017). This difference is partly attributed to changes in the definition of forests and the correction of methodological errors. Government projections show that the net sink is expected to decrease further over this decade, eventually turning into a small source (CCC, 2022).

Commodity-driven deforestation is the dominant driver of tree cover loss in the Philippines (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

The Philippines Development Plan 2017-2022 includes strategies to rehabilitate and restore degraded natural resources and protect the fragile ecosystems while improving the welfare of resource-dependent communities (NEDA, 2017b). Some strategies include:

- Complete delineation of final forest limits including production and high value conservation areas as protection forest.
- Reverse the loss of forest cover through sustained rehabilitation of degraded forestlands including critical watersheds and strengthened protection of remaining natural forests.
- Enhance management of Protected Areas and strengthen sustainable management through the issuance of appropriate tenure and management arrangement.
- Strengthen research and development on forest, watershed and biodiversity.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

The historical GHG emissions between 1990 and 2021 are taken from the PRIMAP database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).

For the LULUCF sector, the historical GHG emissions data is taken from UNFCCC database as officially reported by the country for years 1994 and 2000, and 2010 emissions were taken from the government website (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017).


## NDC and other targets

The updated NDC target is based on a cumulative BAU of 3,340.3 MtCO2e for the period of 2020-2030; however, the update does not include any details on how this BAU was calculated. An annual sector by sector breakdown was subsequently published by the Climate Change Commission (CCC, 2022). We use this information as the basis of our calculations.

GWP valuesThe NDC update and CCC document do not mention the Global Warming Potential values used. The CCC has used GWP from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in past stakeholder consultations and so we assume that that is the basis upon which these NDC calculations have been prepared (Climate Change Commission, 2020).

LULUCFThe NDC update and CCC document to not explicitly discuss the role of the land sector in the NDC target. The 3,340.3 MtCO2e cumulative BAU does include LULUCF, the details for which are provided in the CCC’s document. The NDC update describes the target sectoral coverage as ‘agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy’. We take this statement to mean that efforts in the land sector do not fall within the scope of the Philippines’ target. According to the CCC’s figures, the land use represents a small net sink in 2020 (-24 MtCO2e), which will shrink over the course of the decade to become a small source of emissions in 2030 (3.8 MtCO2e).

Target quantificationWe apply the target reductions to the 2030 BAU value provided in the CCC’s document to calculate 2030 emissions including LULUCF. As the CAT excludes LULUCF from its analysis and the Philippines will not rely on LULUCF measures to achieve its NDC target, we subtract the LULUCF BAU emissions (3.8 MtCO2e) to derive the target value excluding LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

We derive our current policies projection from two principle sources: the 8th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook and the new Philippines Energy Plan 2020-2040.

The lower end of the range is based on the APEC reference scenario (APEC, 2022). This scenario is based on recent trends and current policies, however it is guided by an older Philippines Energy Plan 2018-2040 as well as the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the “Build Build Build” Program with energy supply and demand continuing to increase. The APEC reference scenario follows recent trends in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

APEC scenarios only include energy related CO2 data. To calculate remaining GHG emissions, the CAT has combined the APEC scenario with non-CO2 energy data, estimated using a 5-year historical trend, and using the growth rates for non-CO2 data from the US EPA (2019). All projections data was harmonised with the latest historical year.

The upper end of the range is based on the Philippines Energy Plan (2020-2040) reference scenario (Department of Energy, 2022). The PEP 2020-2040 provides emissions for the energy sector, which we add to non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 emissions using the same approach as the lower end (described above).

The PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario includes the current biofuels blending (2% biodiesel, 10% bioethanol) until 2040, 5% electric vehicles uptake by 2040 and current energy efficiency and conservation efforts maintained to 2040.

Both the PEP and APEC scenarios account for the impact of COVID-19.

The current policies and action emissions range accounts for the coal moratorium under the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario. However, there is still an additional 2.6 GW of coal capacity of additional coal capacity added by 2025 in this scenario. Given the uncertainty of the global energy crisis, the CAT accounts for some uncertainty over the moratorium dates.

The APEC reference scenario does not assume coal capacity is capped, and therefore does not anticipate the coal moratorium is maintained. APEC also produce a Carbon Neutral scenario, which does account for the coal moratorium, but the impacts are only seen by 2030. The CAT uses the APEC reference scenario to 2030 and takes the same assumption as the Carbon Neutral scenario that additional capacity may continue to 2030. Other moratoriums have been lifted in the past. The Department of Energy had a moratorium in oil and gas activities in the West Philippines sea, which was lifted for energy security reasons (APEC, 2022).

The PEP 2020-2040 includes a clean energy scenario (CES) based on clean energy targets, so this is not considered under the CAT current policy and actions trajectory or planned policies. However, when applying the same calculations as applied to the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario as mentioned above, the CES scenario falls within the CAT current policies and action range.

For reference, the clean energy scenario assumes a 35% and 50% share of renewable energy in power generation in 2030 and 2040 respectively. It includes a 5% blending for biodiesel from 2022, a 1.5% increase in fossil gas consumption in transport and industry, a 10% penetration of EVs by 2040, 5% energy savings in oil products and electricity by 2040 and 12% reduction in GHG emissions for the NDC.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Please see the NDC section for the assumptions made in calculating that figure.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The Philippines has submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below a cumulative business as usual (BAU) pathway for 2020-2030 (Philippines Government, 2021). Most of this commitment is conditional on international support. A small fraction, 2.71% of the 75% targeted emissions avoidance, is unconditional. The 2021 NDC also refers to an aspirational target to peak emissions by 2030 (Philippines Government, 2021).

The Philippines unconditional target is not ambitious and will not drive real world emissions reductions. The target level, excluding LULUCF, is 8% - 13% above where we project the country’s emissions to be under current policies in 2030. In other words, the Philippines will meet and exceed this target without taking further action. We rate this target against the Philippines’ fair share contribution to achieving the 1.5°C limit and consider it to be “Insufficient”. Following how the Philippines has chosen to express its NDC, an unconditional target of around 34% below BAU (incl. LULUCF) would be consistent with its 1.5°C fair share contribution.

By contrast, the Philippines’ conditional target is ambitious and we rate it as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’ borders and for which the Philippines will need international support to achieve.

The NDC notes that mitigation actions will strengthen the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity. In addition to mitigation actions, research finds that building up adaptive capacity and resilience is crucial for countries vulnerable to climate change, such as the Philippines (Monsod et al., 2021). The scope of the CAT rating does not cover adaptation efforts.


## NDC Updates

The Philippines submitted an updated target in April 2021 (Philippines Government, 2021). Some key information for understanding the nature of the target is missing from both the first NDC and the update, which makes assessing any increase in ambition difficult. We have relied on subsequent material published by the Philippines’ Climate Change Commission to aid our analysis (see Assumptions tab for the full details).

The Philippines updated its conditional target from 70% below an undisclosed business as usual (BAU) emissions trajectory to 75% below a defined cumulative 2020-2030 BAU emissions trajectory of 3,340.3 MtCO2e. The CAT estimates that the updated conditional target equates to 96 MtCO2e in 2030 excl. LULUCF. This target falls within the lower end of the range that the CAT had derived for the first NDC, using our own BAU assumptions.

The updated target is “1.5°C global least cost” compatible when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the country’s borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve this target. It is not on track to achieve this target based on current policies and will need to adopt further measures with international support.

In a positive development, for the first time, the Philippines Government has set an unconditional target in its NDC update. A small fraction, 2.71% of its 75% below BAU target, is unconditional. However, the unconditional target is well above where the country’s emissions are expected to be in 2030 under current policies. As it will not drive real world emission reductions, we do not consider it to have strengthened the country’s ambition and thus classify it as such on our climate target tracker page.

The CAT updated its rating methodology in September 2021. Prior to that date, we only rated government's target against their fair share contribution. Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C.

Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality. Our rating of the Philippines’ first NDC, which only included a conditional target, followed this approach. This target fell within the “1.5°C compatible” range of our former rating system, but was downgraded to “2°C compatible” because of its conditionality. Under the new rating system, conditional targets from developing countries are assessed against the level of reductions needed within their borders, with international support.

As noted above, the Philippines’ updated conditional NDC target is rated as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible based on our updated rating methodology. Unconditional targets continue to be rated against a fair share contribution. We rate the Philippines’ new unconditional target as “Insufficient”. The target would need to be strengthened to around a 34% reduction from BAU, from its 2.71% level, to represent a fair contribution. Country targets are rated as a package – we combine the two target ratings by averaging.

The final element of the NDC update is an aspirational goal to peak emissions by 2030. However, to achieve its conditional target, the Philippines will need to peak emissions as soon as possible and then start cutting them. It will need international support to adopt such measures.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

The Philippines’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve, and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’s border.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve.

The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO2e or below in 2030.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Since our last assessment, for the Philippines' fair share contribution we have changed both what we are rating and the rating itself. Previously, we rated the Philippines as “2°C compatible”, but this rating was given under our old rating system and in relation to its conditional target (the only one it had at the time). The conditional target actually fell in the “1.5°C compatible” range but was downgraded due to its conditionality (see NDC update section above for further details). The Philippines adopted an unconditional target in its updated NDC. We rate this target against a fair share contribution and find it to be “Insufficient”.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

The Philippines does not have a net zero or long-term target.


## 2020 target

The Philippines did not set a 2020 target.


# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.

For further information on the targets the Philippines has adopted, see the Targets tab.


## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The Philippines has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies, using its own resources, to close the gap between its fair share and current policies, but will also need international support to implement policies for 1.5°C compatibility.


## Policy overview

Emissions are expected to continue to increase throughout the decade, after a short drop due to the impacts of the pandemic. We estimate that emissions will reach 340-357 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF) under current policies. The Philippines is therefore on track to meet and exceed its unconditional target (384 MtCO2e) without taking additional measures, but is far off track from its ambitious conditional target (96 MtCO2e).

Historically, the energy sector has driven emissions growth in the Philippines. In October 2020, then Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi announced a moratorium on new coal fired power plants, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020b).

The Philippines Energy Plan (PEP) (2020-2040), published in 2021, sets out the government’s current plans for the sector. It includes an additional 2.6 GW of coal power to be added by 2025, but much of the former coal pipeline has now been replaced by fossil gas (see the Energy Supply section below for details).

The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on updating the PEP and will expand the time horizon from 2040 to 2050 (Power Philippines News, 2023c). The DOE also plans to integrate hydrogen and ammonia into the energy roadmap and explore harnessing its 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential (Power Philippines News, 2023a). The updated Plan is expected later this year.

The Philippines is also considering whether to revive its nuclear power program, which the CAT does not view as a viable solution to the climate crisis due to its many downsides.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** The Philippines signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane accounted for 83.5 MtCO2e or 33% of emissions excluding LULUCF in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Agriculture accounts for the largest share of methane (61%), followed by waste (24%) and energy (14%). Methane gas coverage is included in the Philippines NDC target, but no explicit methane reduction target is given (Philippines Government, 2021). With methane accounting for 82.5 MtCO2e in 2020 (the pledge reference year), the Philippines would need reduce methane emissions to 58 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet the target.
- **Coal exit:** The Philippines signed the coal exit at COP26, but did not agree to all aspects of the pledge, including stopping issuance of permits for new unabated coal fired power generation projects, despite already having a national coal power moratorium in place (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). Coal is not mentioned in the Philippines’ updated NDC. It continues to play a significant role in the Philippines’ energy mix (see energy section for further details).
- **100% EVs:** The Philippines did not sign the EV pledge at COP26, but it has started to put the regulatory framework in place to support EV uptake in the country. It is considering adopting a 2040 EV stock target of 50%.
- **Forestry:** The Philippines signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The forestry pledge is not mentioned in the NDC, however the NDC target does not include LULUCF, and therefore the Philippines will be relying on real emissions reductions from emissions intensive sectors of the economy.
- **Beyond oil & gas:** The Philippines has not signed up to the Alliance. The Philippines will be reliant on gas imports as three LNG terminals will open in early 2023 (Reuters, 2022a). In 2020, fossil gas represented 19% of power generation (Department of Energy, 2022).

## Energy supply

Security of energy supply is a key issue for the Philippines. Approximately half of the country’s total primary energy supply relies on coal and oil imports (Department of Energy, 2022a). The Philippines has plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023 (Reuters, 2022b). Fossil gas import infrastructure creates more vulnerability to global market price fluctuations, and places the country at particular risk of price increases during the global energy crisis. Fossil gas investment seems misplaced considering the cheaper, cleaner, and domestically sourced alternative that renewable energy can provide.

There are ongoing climate and environmental challenges, such as earthquakes and typhoons that damage power infrastructure, and hydropower supply can be taxed in a longer dry season as the result of effects of El Niño (Rivas, 2019b, 2019a). These challenges are compounded when ensuring power supply over the three power grids across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, and another 132 isolated grids (Fuentes et al., 2020).

Transporting fossil fuels also poses risks. In February, an oil tanker sank off the country's southwest coast, causing significant harm to the lives and livelihoods of residents and the region’s biodiversity (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023). There have been several significant oil spills in the country in the last few decades. Local groups are concerned that the country's fossil gas expansion plans – both in terms of new power plants and the LNG terminals needed to import the fuel to run them – will increase the risk of this type of disaster and further environmental destruction (Cabico, 2023).

Long-term plans to increase renewables can help address these challenges by increasing the indigenous share of energy, and decentralising and diversifying the Philippines’ power mix (Ahmed & Logarta, 2017; Bertheau et al., 2019; Domingo, 2019; Vemuri & Bohn, 2018). These measures can enhance the system’s reliability, and reduce emissions (Cervantes, 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018). If the Philippines couples low carbon development with its energy efficiency goals, it can ensure a more robust power supply for its population.

**Gas**The Philippines plans to meet some of its growing energy demand by significantly increasing its reliance on fossil gas power and build out its LNG infrastructure. As its domestic supply of fossil gas will soon be depleted, it will be reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and undermining its energy security. Fossil gas is not a ‘bridging fuel’ for the transition. It will continue the Philippines’ energy dependence on fossil fuels and risks locking in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure that can become a barrier to moving to zero emissions power (Ahmed, 2020). Analysis indicates that the Philippines needs to phase out fossil gas power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compliant.

About one fifth of the Philippines’ electricity comes from fossil gas. In absolute terms, it plans to almost double the amount generated by 2030, with an additional 150-300% increase by 2040. Fossil gas’ share of the electricity mix will essentially remain constant over the next decade, as demand grows, and will rise to between 27-40% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). The PEP 2020-2040 plans to add an additional 15-21 GW installed capacity of fossil gas by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Compared to the previous 2018-2040 Philippines Energy Plan, fossil gas power generation will increase by 50-100% in 2030. In essence, the Philippines has switched much of its anticipated future coal power with fossil gas.

The Philippines is running out of its domestic supply of fossil gas and thus has begun to build out its LNG import infrastructure to address this shortfall. The country’s sole gas field, Malampaya, will be depleted in the next few years (Power Philippines News, 2023b). The DOE has approved projects to construct seven LNG terminals, three of which are due to begin operations in 2023 (Power Philippines News, 2023b; Reuters, 2022b). The proposed capacity exceeds what is needed and is unlikely to lower electricity costs as expensive coal is replaced with expensive gas (Reynolds, 2022). This rapid scale up of LNG import infrastructure could create USD 14 bn in stranded asset risks (Reynolds, 2021). Many LNG projects have been delayed at an advanced stage of project development, remaining offline due to regulatory delays and face high market risks as renewable energy technology is dispatched (Reynolds, 2021).

**Coal**Coal dominates the Philippines power mix at present and under current plans would continue to play a significant, though slowly diminishing, role until 2040 and beyond, notwithstanding the moratorium on new coal power plants. This continued reliance on coal power poses adverse economic and security risks for the country, in addition to its devasting environmental harm. Analysis suggests that the Philippines needs to phase out coal power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compatible.

Coal represented 57% of the electricity generation mix in 2020. Under current plans, its share will decrease to 45% in 2030 and fall to 23-25% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Yet, as total power generation will grow during this period, the absolute level of coal power generation (and thus emissions) will rise to 2030 and then essentially remain flat or slowly start to fall until 2040.

The Philippines adopted a moratorium on new coal power plants in 2020, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020). Its current plans include an additional 2.6 GW of installed capacity by 2025, but foresees no further additions (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines reliance on coal is a major energy security issue. Around 70% of Philippines coal supply is imported, mainly (97%) from Indonesia (PhilStar, 2022a). In January 2022, Indonesia banned coal exports for the month to secure its own energy supply. The Philippines Foreign Secretary appealed to Indonesia to lift the ban. The ban sent global coal prices higher during the global north’s winter when energy peaks (PhilStar, 2022a)

Power bills continue to increase due to the high reliance on imported coal for power generation and increasing global coal prices (PhilStar, 2022b). The operation of large, inflexible, coal power plants has not shown it can reliably deliver power supply: between March 2019 and September 2021, four major coal power plants registered 14 to 25 outages each, often leading to power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices (Dalusung III & Manansala, 2021). Analysis shows that variable renewable energy can be more reliable and cost effective than coal (Manansala & Lois Tan, 2021).

**Renewables**In the last few years, the Philippines has reinvigorated its policy support for renewable energy, but much greater support is needed for the country to be able to decarbonise its power sector and reverse its slow historic growth trends.

The Philippines fell behind its peers in renewable energy generation in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the Philippines increased its non-hydro renewable energy capacity by just 1.72 GW (Department of Energy, 2022a). This is in stark contrast with many other Asian countries (see chart below comparing Philippines, Indonesia, China, Japan across all renewable energy generation).


### Share of renewable electricity generation

Under the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040, the government aims to reach 35% renewable energy in power generation by 2030 and 50% by 2040. The 2030 target is consistent with both the reference (REF) scenario and clean energy scenario (CES) in the PEP 2020-2040 and equates to 66-68 TWh of renewable energy in 2030, but only the clean energy scenario is consistent with the 2040 target. In 2020, renewables represented 21% of power generation.

In 2021, the Philippines launched its Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), largely as a successor to its Feed-In-Tariff system, to further support the expansion of renewable energy supply (Department of Energy, 2023a). It successfully auctioned 2 GW of renewable capacity in 2022 to be installed between 2023-2025 (Bellini, 2022). Its first auction of 2023 will run from March to June for 11.6 GW of various types of solar power, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy to be installed between 2024-2026 (Crismundo, 2023c). Another auction is planned for the end of 2023 that will include geothermal and hydro power (Crismundo, 2023b). The 13.6 GW that has or is being auctioned to date is roughly in line with the amount of capacity the Philippines had planned to add under its PEP 2020-2040, though it contains significantly more onshore wind than envisaged under that plan.

In May 2022, the World Bank released an offshore wind roadmap for the Philippines (World Bank, 2022). It explored two scenarios – one largely consistent with the country’s current energy plan (PEP 2020-2040) and a high growth scenario. Under the latter scenario, the Philippines could supply 14% of its power needs in 2040 with offshore wind alone and reach 20 GW of installed capacity. For reference, the current clean energy scenario in the PEP envisages just under 12 GW of all types of wind power in 2040. The high growth scenario resulted in greater cost reductions and more jobs than the scenario consistent with the government’s current plans.

Significant upgrades are needed to the transmission network to support this level of offshore wind power. The World Bank also noted that limitations on foreign ownership of RE projects posed a barrier to securing international financing.

The government has started working on its regulatory framework to support offshore wind and is considering it, along with possible green hydrogen production, as part of the energy plan update due to be released later this year (Power Philippines News, 2022, 2023a). In December 2022, the Department of Energy rescinded the limitations on foreign ownership of renewable energy projects, paving the way to greater outside investment (Department of Energy, 2022b).

**Nuclear**The Philippines is considering whether to revive its nuclear power programme. The Bataan Nuclear Power plant was built in the 1980s but was never brought online; instead it was shelved in the aftermath of Chernobyl (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). President Marcos Jr., whose father commissioned the plant during his Presidency, is considering reviving the plant (ABS-CBN News, 2022). Costs to revive the plant range from one to several billion USD (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). The Department of Energy is also considering new reactors, especially small modular reactors with capacities of 50 MW to 300 MW (Cruz, 2023; IAEA, 2022; Mercurio, 2022).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as a solution to the climate crisis due to its inherent risks (accidents, proliferation, etc), high and increasing costs compared to renewable energy alternatives, long construction times, incompatibility with intermittent RE generation, and its vulnerability to environmental and climate extreme events. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, such as typhoons that hit the country every year, and located in the Ring of Fire, exposing it to seismic activity.


## Transport

The Philippines’ transport sector is the country’s third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport accounts for 90% of the transport sector’s final energy consumption, followed by 8% water transport, 2% domestic air travel, <1% railways (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines has started to take important steps to boost its EV market. In 2022, it passed the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) which seeks to create an enabling environment for the development of the national EV industry (Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA), 2022). In January 2023, it issued Executive Order (EO) No. 12 which removes import duties on several types of EVs and suspended taxes on charging and distribution components for the next five years aiming to make EVs more accessible to Filipinos (Philstar, 2023; Executive Order No. 12, s. 2023, 2023; Tresvalles, 2023).

The EV Act includes a stock target for corporate and government fleets of at least 5% initially, gradually increasing to 10%, but does not include a timeline for achieving these goals. The government is expected to flesh out the details of this target and introduce others for all EVs in the Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development (Crismundo, 2023a). The government is considering a 50% EV stock target by 2040, meaning half of all vehicles in circulation will be electric by that time (Velasco, 2023). The Philippines currently has only fractions of a percent of EV in either sales or total stock (Department of Energy, 2023b).

While these developments to support EV uptake in the Philippines are positive, they must be coupled with the rapid decarbonisation of the country’s power sector to achieve the full climate benefits.

Globally, all new passenger vehicles sold should be electric by 2035 and EVs share of the total light duty vehicle stock should be between 65-90% by 2040 to be 1.5°C compatible.

The ‘Build, Build, Build’ programme targets infrastructure development, especially roads and urban mobility. Some noteworthy projects are Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in Cebu and improvements in the BRT system in Manilla (Republic of the Philippines, 2020). Investments in public transport are nonetheless lacking in many major urban centres (Chang et al., 2021). The country’s first subway - in Manila - is expected to partially open in 2025, and be fully operational by 2028 (International Railway Journal, 2022). Higher investments in public infrastructure would support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and lead to air pollution co-benefits.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. National inventory data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000, shrinking to 37 MtCO2e by 2010 (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017). This difference is partly attributed to changes in the definition of forests and the correction of methodological errors. Government projections show that the net sink is expected to decrease further over this decade, eventually turning into a small source (CCC, 2022).

Commodity-driven deforestation is the dominant driver of tree cover loss in the Philippines (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

The Philippines Development Plan 2017-2022 includes strategies to rehabilitate and restore degraded natural resources and protect the fragile ecosystems while improving the welfare of resource-dependent communities (NEDA, 2017b). Some strategies include:

- Complete delineation of final forest limits including production and high value conservation areas as protection forest.
- Reverse the loss of forest cover through sustained rehabilitation of degraded forestlands including critical watersheds and strengthened protection of remaining natural forests.
- Enhance management of Protected Areas and strengthen sustainable management through the issuance of appropriate tenure and management arrangement.
- Strengthen research and development on forest, watershed and biodiversity.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

The historical GHG emissions between 1990 and 2021 are taken from the PRIMAP database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).

For the LULUCF sector, the historical GHG emissions data is taken from UNFCCC database as officially reported by the country for years 1994 and 2000, and 2010 emissions were taken from the government website (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017).


## NDC and other targets

The updated NDC target is based on a cumulative BAU of 3,340.3 MtCO2e for the period of 2020-2030; however, the update does not include any details on how this BAU was calculated. An annual sector by sector breakdown was subsequently published by the Climate Change Commission (CCC, 2022). We use this information as the basis of our calculations.

GWP valuesThe NDC update and CCC document do not mention the Global Warming Potential values used. The CCC has used GWP from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in past stakeholder consultations and so we assume that that is the basis upon which these NDC calculations have been prepared (Climate Change Commission, 2020).

LULUCFThe NDC update and CCC document to not explicitly discuss the role of the land sector in the NDC target. The 3,340.3 MtCO2e cumulative BAU does include LULUCF, the details for which are provided in the CCC’s document. The NDC update describes the target sectoral coverage as ‘agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy’. We take this statement to mean that efforts in the land sector do not fall within the scope of the Philippines’ target. According to the CCC’s figures, the land use represents a small net sink in 2020 (-24 MtCO2e), which will shrink over the course of the decade to become a small source of emissions in 2030 (3.8 MtCO2e).

Target quantificationWe apply the target reductions to the 2030 BAU value provided in the CCC’s document to calculate 2030 emissions including LULUCF. As the CAT excludes LULUCF from its analysis and the Philippines will not rely on LULUCF measures to achieve its NDC target, we subtract the LULUCF BAU emissions (3.8 MtCO2e) to derive the target value excluding LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

We derive our current policies projection from two principle sources: the 8th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook and the new Philippines Energy Plan 2020-2040.

The lower end of the range is based on the APEC reference scenario (APEC, 2022). This scenario is based on recent trends and current policies, however it is guided by an older Philippines Energy Plan 2018-2040 as well as the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the “Build Build Build” Program with energy supply and demand continuing to increase. The APEC reference scenario follows recent trends in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

APEC scenarios only include energy related CO2 data. To calculate remaining GHG emissions, the CAT has combined the APEC scenario with non-CO2 energy data, estimated using a 5-year historical trend, and using the growth rates for non-CO2 data from the US EPA (2019). All projections data was harmonised with the latest historical year.

The upper end of the range is based on the Philippines Energy Plan (2020-2040) reference scenario (Department of Energy, 2022). The PEP 2020-2040 provides emissions for the energy sector, which we add to non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 emissions using the same approach as the lower end (described above).

The PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario includes the current biofuels blending (2% biodiesel, 10% bioethanol) until 2040, 5% electric vehicles uptake by 2040 and current energy efficiency and conservation efforts maintained to 2040.

Both the PEP and APEC scenarios account for the impact of COVID-19.

The current policies and action emissions range accounts for the coal moratorium under the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario. However, there is still an additional 2.6 GW of coal capacity of additional coal capacity added by 2025 in this scenario. Given the uncertainty of the global energy crisis, the CAT accounts for some uncertainty over the moratorium dates.

The APEC reference scenario does not assume coal capacity is capped, and therefore does not anticipate the coal moratorium is maintained. APEC also produce a Carbon Neutral scenario, which does account for the coal moratorium, but the impacts are only seen by 2030. The CAT uses the APEC reference scenario to 2030 and takes the same assumption as the Carbon Neutral scenario that additional capacity may continue to 2030. Other moratoriums have been lifted in the past. The Department of Energy had a moratorium in oil and gas activities in the West Philippines sea, which was lifted for energy security reasons (APEC, 2022).

The PEP 2020-2040 includes a clean energy scenario (CES) based on clean energy targets, so this is not considered under the CAT current policy and actions trajectory or planned policies. However, when applying the same calculations as applied to the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario as mentioned above, the CES scenario falls within the CAT current policies and action range.

For reference, the clean energy scenario assumes a 35% and 50% share of renewable energy in power generation in 2030 and 2040 respectively. It includes a 5% blending for biodiesel from 2022, a 1.5% increase in fossil gas consumption in transport and industry, a 10% penetration of EVs by 2040, 5% energy savings in oil products and electricity by 2040 and 12% reduction in GHG emissions for the NDC.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Please see the NDC section for the assumptions made in calculating that figure.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The Philippines has submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below a cumulative business as usual (BAU) pathway for 2020-2030 (Philippines Government, 2021). Most of this commitment is conditional on international support. A small fraction, 2.71% of the 75% targeted emissions avoidance, is unconditional. The 2021 NDC also refers to an aspirational target to peak emissions by 2030 (Philippines Government, 2021).

The Philippines unconditional target is not ambitious and will not drive real world emissions reductions. The target level, excluding LULUCF, is 8% - 13% above where we project the country’s emissions to be under current policies in 2030. In other words, the Philippines will meet and exceed this target without taking further action. We rate this target against the Philippines’ fair share contribution to achieving the 1.5°C limit and consider it to be “Insufficient”. Following how the Philippines has chosen to express its NDC, an unconditional target of around 34% below BAU (incl. LULUCF) would be consistent with its 1.5°C fair share contribution.

By contrast, the Philippines’ conditional target is ambitious and we rate it as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’ borders and for which the Philippines will need international support to achieve.

The NDC notes that mitigation actions will strengthen the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity. In addition to mitigation actions, research finds that building up adaptive capacity and resilience is crucial for countries vulnerable to climate change, such as the Philippines (Monsod et al., 2021). The scope of the CAT rating does not cover adaptation efforts.


## NDC Updates

The Philippines submitted an updated target in April 2021 (Philippines Government, 2021). Some key information for understanding the nature of the target is missing from both the first NDC and the update, which makes assessing any increase in ambition difficult. We have relied on subsequent material published by the Philippines’ Climate Change Commission to aid our analysis (see Assumptions tab for the full details).

The Philippines updated its conditional target from 70% below an undisclosed business as usual (BAU) emissions trajectory to 75% below a defined cumulative 2020-2030 BAU emissions trajectory of 3,340.3 MtCO2e. The CAT estimates that the updated conditional target equates to 96 MtCO2e in 2030 excl. LULUCF. This target falls within the lower end of the range that the CAT had derived for the first NDC, using our own BAU assumptions.

The updated target is “1.5°C global least cost” compatible when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the country’s borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve this target. It is not on track to achieve this target based on current policies and will need to adopt further measures with international support.

In a positive development, for the first time, the Philippines Government has set an unconditional target in its NDC update. A small fraction, 2.71% of its 75% below BAU target, is unconditional. However, the unconditional target is well above where the country’s emissions are expected to be in 2030 under current policies. As it will not drive real world emission reductions, we do not consider it to have strengthened the country’s ambition and thus classify it as such on our climate target tracker page.

The CAT updated its rating methodology in September 2021. Prior to that date, we only rated government's target against their fair share contribution. Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C.

Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality. Our rating of the Philippines’ first NDC, which only included a conditional target, followed this approach. This target fell within the “1.5°C compatible” range of our former rating system, but was downgraded to “2°C compatible” because of its conditionality. Under the new rating system, conditional targets from developing countries are assessed against the level of reductions needed within their borders, with international support.

As noted above, the Philippines’ updated conditional NDC target is rated as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible based on our updated rating methodology. Unconditional targets continue to be rated against a fair share contribution. We rate the Philippines’ new unconditional target as “Insufficient”. The target would need to be strengthened to around a 34% reduction from BAU, from its 2.71% level, to represent a fair contribution. Country targets are rated as a package – we combine the two target ratings by averaging.

The final element of the NDC update is an aspirational goal to peak emissions by 2030. However, to achieve its conditional target, the Philippines will need to peak emissions as soon as possible and then start cutting them. It will need international support to adopt such measures.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

The Philippines’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve, and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’s border.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve.

The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO2e or below in 2030.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Since our last assessment, for the Philippines' fair share contribution we have changed both what we are rating and the rating itself. Previously, we rated the Philippines as “2°C compatible”, but this rating was given under our old rating system and in relation to its conditional target (the only one it had at the time). The conditional target actually fell in the “1.5°C compatible” range but was downgraded due to its conditionality (see NDC update section above for further details). The Philippines adopted an unconditional target in its updated NDC. We rate this target against a fair share contribution and find it to be “Insufficient”.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

The Philippines does not have a net zero or long-term target.


## 2020 target

The Philippines did not set a 2020 target.


# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.

For further information on the targets the Philippines has adopted, see the Targets tab.


## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The Philippines has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies, using its own resources, to close the gap between its fair share and current policies, but will also need international support to implement policies for 1.5°C compatibility.


## Policy overview

Emissions are expected to continue to increase throughout the decade, after a short drop due to the impacts of the pandemic. We estimate that emissions will reach 340-357 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF) under current policies. The Philippines is therefore on track to meet and exceed its unconditional target (384 MtCO2e) without taking additional measures, but is far off track from its ambitious conditional target (96 MtCO2e).

Historically, the energy sector has driven emissions growth in the Philippines. In October 2020, then Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi announced a moratorium on new coal fired power plants, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020b).

The Philippines Energy Plan (PEP) (2020-2040), published in 2021, sets out the government’s current plans for the sector. It includes an additional 2.6 GW of coal power to be added by 2025, but much of the former coal pipeline has now been replaced by fossil gas (see the Energy Supply section below for details).

The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on updating the PEP and will expand the time horizon from 2040 to 2050 (Power Philippines News, 2023c). The DOE also plans to integrate hydrogen and ammonia into the energy roadmap and explore harnessing its 178 GW of technical offshore wind potential (Power Philippines News, 2023a). The updated Plan is expected later this year.

The Philippines is also considering whether to revive its nuclear power program, which the CAT does not view as a viable solution to the climate crisis due to its many downsides.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** The Philippines signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane accounted for 83.5 MtCO2e or 33% of emissions excluding LULUCF in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Agriculture accounts for the largest share of methane (61%), followed by waste (24%) and energy (14%). Methane gas coverage is included in the Philippines NDC target, but no explicit methane reduction target is given (Philippines Government, 2021). With methane accounting for 82.5 MtCO2e in 2020 (the pledge reference year), the Philippines would need reduce methane emissions to 58 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet the target.
- **Coal exit:** The Philippines signed the coal exit at COP26, but did not agree to all aspects of the pledge, including stopping issuance of permits for new unabated coal fired power generation projects, despite already having a national coal power moratorium in place (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021). Coal is not mentioned in the Philippines’ updated NDC. It continues to play a significant role in the Philippines’ energy mix (see energy section for further details).
- **100% EVs:** The Philippines did not sign the EV pledge at COP26, but it has started to put the regulatory framework in place to support EV uptake in the country. It is considering adopting a 2040 EV stock target of 50%.
- **Forestry:** The Philippines signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The forestry pledge is not mentioned in the NDC, however the NDC target does not include LULUCF, and therefore the Philippines will be relying on real emissions reductions from emissions intensive sectors of the economy.
- **Beyond oil & gas:** The Philippines has not signed up to the Alliance. The Philippines will be reliant on gas imports as three LNG terminals will open in early 2023 (Reuters, 2022a). In 2020, fossil gas represented 19% of power generation (Department of Energy, 2022).

## Energy supply

Security of energy supply is a key issue for the Philippines. Approximately half of the country’s total primary energy supply relies on coal and oil imports (Department of Energy, 2022a). The Philippines has plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023 (Reuters, 2022b). Fossil gas import infrastructure creates more vulnerability to global market price fluctuations, and places the country at particular risk of price increases during the global energy crisis. Fossil gas investment seems misplaced considering the cheaper, cleaner, and domestically sourced alternative that renewable energy can provide.

There are ongoing climate and environmental challenges, such as earthquakes and typhoons that damage power infrastructure, and hydropower supply can be taxed in a longer dry season as the result of effects of El Niño (Rivas, 2019b, 2019a). These challenges are compounded when ensuring power supply over the three power grids across Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, and another 132 isolated grids (Fuentes et al., 2020).

Transporting fossil fuels also poses risks. In February, an oil tanker sank off the country's southwest coast, causing significant harm to the lives and livelihoods of residents and the region’s biodiversity (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023). There have been several significant oil spills in the country in the last few decades. Local groups are concerned that the country's fossil gas expansion plans – both in terms of new power plants and the LNG terminals needed to import the fuel to run them – will increase the risk of this type of disaster and further environmental destruction (Cabico, 2023).

Long-term plans to increase renewables can help address these challenges by increasing the indigenous share of energy, and decentralising and diversifying the Philippines’ power mix (Ahmed & Logarta, 2017; Bertheau et al., 2019; Domingo, 2019; Vemuri & Bohn, 2018). These measures can enhance the system’s reliability, and reduce emissions (Cervantes, 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018). If the Philippines couples low carbon development with its energy efficiency goals, it can ensure a more robust power supply for its population.

**Gas**The Philippines plans to meet some of its growing energy demand by significantly increasing its reliance on fossil gas power and build out its LNG infrastructure. As its domestic supply of fossil gas will soon be depleted, it will be reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and undermining its energy security. Fossil gas is not a ‘bridging fuel’ for the transition. It will continue the Philippines’ energy dependence on fossil fuels and risks locking in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure that can become a barrier to moving to zero emissions power (Ahmed, 2020). Analysis indicates that the Philippines needs to phase out fossil gas power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compliant.

About one fifth of the Philippines’ electricity comes from fossil gas. In absolute terms, it plans to almost double the amount generated by 2030, with an additional 150-300% increase by 2040. Fossil gas’ share of the electricity mix will essentially remain constant over the next decade, as demand grows, and will rise to between 27-40% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). The PEP 2020-2040 plans to add an additional 15-21 GW installed capacity of fossil gas by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Compared to the previous 2018-2040 Philippines Energy Plan, fossil gas power generation will increase by 50-100% in 2030. In essence, the Philippines has switched much of its anticipated future coal power with fossil gas.

The Philippines is running out of its domestic supply of fossil gas and thus has begun to build out its LNG import infrastructure to address this shortfall. The country’s sole gas field, Malampaya, will be depleted in the next few years (Power Philippines News, 2023b). The DOE has approved projects to construct seven LNG terminals, three of which are due to begin operations in 2023 (Power Philippines News, 2023b; Reuters, 2022b). The proposed capacity exceeds what is needed and is unlikely to lower electricity costs as expensive coal is replaced with expensive gas (Reynolds, 2022). This rapid scale up of LNG import infrastructure could create USD 14 bn in stranded asset risks (Reynolds, 2021). Many LNG projects have been delayed at an advanced stage of project development, remaining offline due to regulatory delays and face high market risks as renewable energy technology is dispatched (Reynolds, 2021).

**Coal**Coal dominates the Philippines power mix at present and under current plans would continue to play a significant, though slowly diminishing, role until 2040 and beyond, notwithstanding the moratorium on new coal power plants. This continued reliance on coal power poses adverse economic and security risks for the country, in addition to its devasting environmental harm. Analysis suggests that the Philippines needs to phase out coal power by 2035 to be 1.5°C compatible.

Coal represented 57% of the electricity generation mix in 2020. Under current plans, its share will decrease to 45% in 2030 and fall to 23-25% by 2040 (Department of Energy, 2022a). Yet, as total power generation will grow during this period, the absolute level of coal power generation (and thus emissions) will rise to 2030 and then essentially remain flat or slowly start to fall until 2040.

The Philippines adopted a moratorium on new coal power plants in 2020, but allowed those already under development to proceed (Department of Energy, 2020). Its current plans include an additional 2.6 GW of installed capacity by 2025, but foresees no further additions (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines reliance on coal is a major energy security issue. Around 70% of Philippines coal supply is imported, mainly (97%) from Indonesia (PhilStar, 2022a). In January 2022, Indonesia banned coal exports for the month to secure its own energy supply. The Philippines Foreign Secretary appealed to Indonesia to lift the ban. The ban sent global coal prices higher during the global north’s winter when energy peaks (PhilStar, 2022a)

Power bills continue to increase due to the high reliance on imported coal for power generation and increasing global coal prices (PhilStar, 2022b). The operation of large, inflexible, coal power plants has not shown it can reliably deliver power supply: between March 2019 and September 2021, four major coal power plants registered 14 to 25 outages each, often leading to power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices (Dalusung III & Manansala, 2021). Analysis shows that variable renewable energy can be more reliable and cost effective than coal (Manansala & Lois Tan, 2021).

**Renewables**In the last few years, the Philippines has reinvigorated its policy support for renewable energy, but much greater support is needed for the country to be able to decarbonise its power sector and reverse its slow historic growth trends.

The Philippines fell behind its peers in renewable energy generation in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the Philippines increased its non-hydro renewable energy capacity by just 1.72 GW (Department of Energy, 2022a). This is in stark contrast with many other Asian countries (see chart below comparing Philippines, Indonesia, China, Japan across all renewable energy generation).


### Share of renewable electricity generation

Under the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040, the government aims to reach 35% renewable energy in power generation by 2030 and 50% by 2040. The 2030 target is consistent with both the reference (REF) scenario and clean energy scenario (CES) in the PEP 2020-2040 and equates to 66-68 TWh of renewable energy in 2030, but only the clean energy scenario is consistent with the 2040 target. In 2020, renewables represented 21% of power generation.

In 2021, the Philippines launched its Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), largely as a successor to its Feed-In-Tariff system, to further support the expansion of renewable energy supply (Department of Energy, 2023a). It successfully auctioned 2 GW of renewable capacity in 2022 to be installed between 2023-2025 (Bellini, 2022). Its first auction of 2023 will run from March to June for 11.6 GW of various types of solar power, onshore wind, biomass and waste-to-energy to be installed between 2024-2026 (Crismundo, 2023c). Another auction is planned for the end of 2023 that will include geothermal and hydro power (Crismundo, 2023b). The 13.6 GW that has or is being auctioned to date is roughly in line with the amount of capacity the Philippines had planned to add under its PEP 2020-2040, though it contains significantly more onshore wind than envisaged under that plan.

In May 2022, the World Bank released an offshore wind roadmap for the Philippines (World Bank, 2022). It explored two scenarios – one largely consistent with the country’s current energy plan (PEP 2020-2040) and a high growth scenario. Under the latter scenario, the Philippines could supply 14% of its power needs in 2040 with offshore wind alone and reach 20 GW of installed capacity. For reference, the current clean energy scenario in the PEP envisages just under 12 GW of all types of wind power in 2040. The high growth scenario resulted in greater cost reductions and more jobs than the scenario consistent with the government’s current plans.

Significant upgrades are needed to the transmission network to support this level of offshore wind power. The World Bank also noted that limitations on foreign ownership of RE projects posed a barrier to securing international financing.

The government has started working on its regulatory framework to support offshore wind and is considering it, along with possible green hydrogen production, as part of the energy plan update due to be released later this year (Power Philippines News, 2022, 2023a). In December 2022, the Department of Energy rescinded the limitations on foreign ownership of renewable energy projects, paving the way to greater outside investment (Department of Energy, 2022b).

**Nuclear**The Philippines is considering whether to revive its nuclear power programme. The Bataan Nuclear Power plant was built in the 1980s but was never brought online; instead it was shelved in the aftermath of Chernobyl (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). President Marcos Jr., whose father commissioned the plant during his Presidency, is considering reviving the plant (ABS-CBN News, 2022). Costs to revive the plant range from one to several billion USD (Crismundo, 2022; Wingfield-Hayes, 2023). The Department of Energy is also considering new reactors, especially small modular reactors with capacities of 50 MW to 300 MW (Cruz, 2023; IAEA, 2022; Mercurio, 2022).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as a solution to the climate crisis due to its inherent risks (accidents, proliferation, etc), high and increasing costs compared to renewable energy alternatives, long construction times, incompatibility with intermittent RE generation, and its vulnerability to environmental and climate extreme events. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, such as typhoons that hit the country every year, and located in the Ring of Fire, exposing it to seismic activity.


## Transport

The Philippines’ transport sector is the country’s third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport accounts for 90% of the transport sector’s final energy consumption, followed by 8% water transport, 2% domestic air travel, <1% railways (Department of Energy, 2022a).

The Philippines has started to take important steps to boost its EV market. In 2022, it passed the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) which seeks to create an enabling environment for the development of the national EV industry (Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA), 2022). In January 2023, it issued Executive Order (EO) No. 12 which removes import duties on several types of EVs and suspended taxes on charging and distribution components for the next five years aiming to make EVs more accessible to Filipinos (Philstar, 2023; Executive Order No. 12, s. 2023, 2023; Tresvalles, 2023).

The EV Act includes a stock target for corporate and government fleets of at least 5% initially, gradually increasing to 10%, but does not include a timeline for achieving these goals. The government is expected to flesh out the details of this target and introduce others for all EVs in the Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development (Crismundo, 2023a). The government is considering a 50% EV stock target by 2040, meaning half of all vehicles in circulation will be electric by that time (Velasco, 2023). The Philippines currently has only fractions of a percent of EV in either sales or total stock (Department of Energy, 2023b).

While these developments to support EV uptake in the Philippines are positive, they must be coupled with the rapid decarbonisation of the country’s power sector to achieve the full climate benefits.

Globally, all new passenger vehicles sold should be electric by 2035 and EVs share of the total light duty vehicle stock should be between 65-90% by 2040 to be 1.5°C compatible.

The ‘Build, Build, Build’ programme targets infrastructure development, especially roads and urban mobility. Some noteworthy projects are Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in Cebu and improvements in the BRT system in Manilla (Republic of the Philippines, 2020). Investments in public transport are nonetheless lacking in many major urban centres (Chang et al., 2021). The country’s first subway - in Manila - is expected to partially open in 2025, and be fully operational by 2028 (International Railway Journal, 2022). Higher investments in public infrastructure would support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and lead to air pollution co-benefits.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. National inventory data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000, shrinking to 37 MtCO2e by 2010 (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017). This difference is partly attributed to changes in the definition of forests and the correction of methodological errors. Government projections show that the net sink is expected to decrease further over this decade, eventually turning into a small source (CCC, 2022).

Commodity-driven deforestation is the dominant driver of tree cover loss in the Philippines (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

The Philippines Development Plan 2017-2022 includes strategies to rehabilitate and restore degraded natural resources and protect the fragile ecosystems while improving the welfare of resource-dependent communities (NEDA, 2017b). Some strategies include:

- Complete delineation of final forest limits including production and high value conservation areas as protection forest.
- Reverse the loss of forest cover through sustained rehabilitation of degraded forestlands including critical watersheds and strengthened protection of remaining natural forests.
- Enhance management of Protected Areas and strengthen sustainable management through the issuance of appropriate tenure and management arrangement.
- Strengthen research and development on forest, watershed and biodiversity.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

The historical GHG emissions between 1990 and 2021 are taken from the PRIMAP database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).

For the LULUCF sector, the historical GHG emissions data is taken from UNFCCC database as officially reported by the country for years 1994 and 2000, and 2010 emissions were taken from the government website (NICCDIES, 2021; UNFCCC, 2017).


## NDC and other targets

The updated NDC target is based on a cumulative BAU of 3,340.3 MtCO2e for the period of 2020-2030; however, the update does not include any details on how this BAU was calculated. An annual sector by sector breakdown was subsequently published by the Climate Change Commission (CCC, 2022). We use this information as the basis of our calculations.

GWP valuesThe NDC update and CCC document do not mention the Global Warming Potential values used. The CCC has used GWP from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in past stakeholder consultations and so we assume that that is the basis upon which these NDC calculations have been prepared (Climate Change Commission, 2020).

LULUCFThe NDC update and CCC document to not explicitly discuss the role of the land sector in the NDC target. The 3,340.3 MtCO2e cumulative BAU does include LULUCF, the details for which are provided in the CCC’s document. The NDC update describes the target sectoral coverage as ‘agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy’. We take this statement to mean that efforts in the land sector do not fall within the scope of the Philippines’ target. According to the CCC’s figures, the land use represents a small net sink in 2020 (-24 MtCO2e), which will shrink over the course of the decade to become a small source of emissions in 2030 (3.8 MtCO2e).

Target quantificationWe apply the target reductions to the 2030 BAU value provided in the CCC’s document to calculate 2030 emissions including LULUCF. As the CAT excludes LULUCF from its analysis and the Philippines will not rely on LULUCF measures to achieve its NDC target, we subtract the LULUCF BAU emissions (3.8 MtCO2e) to derive the target value excluding LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

We derive our current policies projection from two principle sources: the 8th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook and the new Philippines Energy Plan 2020-2040.

The lower end of the range is based on the APEC reference scenario (APEC, 2022). This scenario is based on recent trends and current policies, however it is guided by an older Philippines Energy Plan 2018-2040 as well as the AmBisyon Natin 2040 and the “Build Build Build” Program with energy supply and demand continuing to increase. The APEC reference scenario follows recent trends in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

APEC scenarios only include energy related CO2 data. To calculate remaining GHG emissions, the CAT has combined the APEC scenario with non-CO2 energy data, estimated using a 5-year historical trend, and using the growth rates for non-CO2 data from the US EPA (2019). All projections data was harmonised with the latest historical year.

The upper end of the range is based on the Philippines Energy Plan (2020-2040) reference scenario (Department of Energy, 2022). The PEP 2020-2040 provides emissions for the energy sector, which we add to non-energy CO2 and non-CO2 emissions using the same approach as the lower end (described above).

The PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario includes the current biofuels blending (2% biodiesel, 10% bioethanol) until 2040, 5% electric vehicles uptake by 2040 and current energy efficiency and conservation efforts maintained to 2040.

Both the PEP and APEC scenarios account for the impact of COVID-19.

The current policies and action emissions range accounts for the coal moratorium under the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario. However, there is still an additional 2.6 GW of coal capacity of additional coal capacity added by 2025 in this scenario. Given the uncertainty of the global energy crisis, the CAT accounts for some uncertainty over the moratorium dates.

The APEC reference scenario does not assume coal capacity is capped, and therefore does not anticipate the coal moratorium is maintained. APEC also produce a Carbon Neutral scenario, which does account for the coal moratorium, but the impacts are only seen by 2030. The CAT uses the APEC reference scenario to 2030 and takes the same assumption as the Carbon Neutral scenario that additional capacity may continue to 2030. Other moratoriums have been lifted in the past. The Department of Energy had a moratorium in oil and gas activities in the West Philippines sea, which was lifted for energy security reasons (APEC, 2022).

The PEP 2020-2040 includes a clean energy scenario (CES) based on clean energy targets, so this is not considered under the CAT current policy and actions trajectory or planned policies. However, when applying the same calculations as applied to the PEP 2020-2040 reference scenario as mentioned above, the CES scenario falls within the CAT current policies and action range.

For reference, the clean energy scenario assumes a 35% and 50% share of renewable energy in power generation in 2030 and 2040 respectively. It includes a 5% blending for biodiesel from 2022, a 1.5% increase in fossil gas consumption in transport and industry, a 10% penetration of EVs by 2040, 5% energy savings in oil products and electricity by 2040 and 12% reduction in GHG emissions for the NDC.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Please see the NDC section for the assumptions made in calculating that figure.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The Philippines has submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below a cumulative business as usual (BAU) pathway for 2020-2030 (Philippines Government, 2021). Most of this commitment is conditional on international support. A small fraction, 2.71% of the 75% targeted emissions avoidance, is unconditional. The 2021 NDC also refers to an aspirational target to peak emissions by 2030 (Philippines Government, 2021).

The Philippines unconditional target is not ambitious and will not drive real world emissions reductions. The target level, excluding LULUCF, is 8% - 13% above where we project the country’s emissions to be under current policies in 2030. In other words, the Philippines will meet and exceed this target without taking further action. We rate this target against the Philippines’ fair share contribution to achieving the 1.5°C limit and consider it to be “Insufficient”. Following how the Philippines has chosen to express its NDC, an unconditional target of around 34% below BAU (incl. LULUCF) would be consistent with its 1.5°C fair share contribution.

By contrast, the Philippines’ conditional target is ambitious and we rate it as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’ borders and for which the Philippines will need international support to achieve.

The NDC notes that mitigation actions will strengthen the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity. In addition to mitigation actions, research finds that building up adaptive capacity and resilience is crucial for countries vulnerable to climate change, such as the Philippines (Monsod et al., 2021). The scope of the CAT rating does not cover adaptation efforts.


## NDC Updates

The Philippines submitted an updated target in April 2021 (Philippines Government, 2021). Some key information for understanding the nature of the target is missing from both the first NDC and the update, which makes assessing any increase in ambition difficult. We have relied on subsequent material published by the Philippines’ Climate Change Commission to aid our analysis (see Assumptions tab for the full details).

The Philippines updated its conditional target from 70% below an undisclosed business as usual (BAU) emissions trajectory to 75% below a defined cumulative 2020-2030 BAU emissions trajectory of 3,340.3 MtCO2e. The CAT estimates that the updated conditional target equates to 96 MtCO2e in 2030 excl. LULUCF. This target falls within the lower end of the range that the CAT had derived for the first NDC, using our own BAU assumptions.

The updated target is “1.5°C global least cost” compatible when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the country’s borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve this target. It is not on track to achieve this target based on current policies and will need to adopt further measures with international support.

In a positive development, for the first time, the Philippines Government has set an unconditional target in its NDC update. A small fraction, 2.71% of its 75% below BAU target, is unconditional. However, the unconditional target is well above where the country’s emissions are expected to be in 2030 under current policies. As it will not drive real world emission reductions, we do not consider it to have strengthened the country’s ambition and thus classify it as such on our climate target tracker page.

The CAT updated its rating methodology in September 2021. Prior to that date, we only rated government's target against their fair share contribution. Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C.

Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality. Our rating of the Philippines’ first NDC, which only included a conditional target, followed this approach. This target fell within the “1.5°C compatible” range of our former rating system, but was downgraded to “2°C compatible” because of its conditionality. Under the new rating system, conditional targets from developing countries are assessed against the level of reductions needed within their borders, with international support.

As noted above, the Philippines’ updated conditional NDC target is rated as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible based on our updated rating methodology. Unconditional targets continue to be rated against a fair share contribution. We rate the Philippines’ new unconditional target as “Insufficient”. The target would need to be strengthened to around a 34% reduction from BAU, from its 2.71% level, to represent a fair contribution. Country targets are rated as a package – we combine the two target ratings by averaging.

The final element of the NDC update is an aspirational goal to peak emissions by 2030. However, to achieve its conditional target, the Philippines will need to peak emissions as soon as possible and then start cutting them. It will need international support to adopt such measures.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Philippines will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

The Philippines’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve, and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within the Philippines’s border.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve.

The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO2e or below in 2030.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Since our last assessment, for the Philippines' fair share contribution we have changed both what we are rating and the rating itself. Previously, we rated the Philippines as “2°C compatible”, but this rating was given under our old rating system and in relation to its conditional target (the only one it had at the time). The conditional target actually fell in the “1.5°C compatible” range but was downgraded due to its conditionality (see NDC update section above for further details). The Philippines adopted an unconditional target in its updated NDC. We rate this target against a fair share contribution and find it to be “Insufficient”.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

The Philippines does not have a net zero or long-term target.


## 2020 target

The Philippines did not set a 2020 target.


# Summary


## Overview

**The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall.**

On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts.

Recent developments in the Philippines include:

- Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security.
- A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future.
- Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year.
- Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development.
The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan.

The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”**.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support.

We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so.

Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.

The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).

Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target.

The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.

We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

The Philippines does not have a net zero target.
