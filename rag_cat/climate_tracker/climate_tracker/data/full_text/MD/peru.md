# Summary


## Overview

**Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and** **has changed his ministerial cabinet five times****, adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall.**

**The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project.**

**However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a** **study from the IEA****, any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.**

**The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.**

**COP26 called for** **more ambitious NDCs**** to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account.**

The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share.

Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share.

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels).

In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset. This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate Peru’s unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together.

Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**

The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). As of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not yet submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Peru’s net zero target given the preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Peru provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Peru provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The Peruvian government stated its intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as part of its updated NDC in 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). The government is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy which is to include a net zero emissions target by 2050 and is expected to be approved by the government latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). The 2050 target year has so far been emphasized and referred to on different occasions by the Ministry of Environment (El Peruano, 2021). However, as of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Peru provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Peru provides no information on its intention to the planning of how to reach the net zero targets.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Peru provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Peru has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. According to our calculations, national emissions dropped 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions growth is rapidly picking up and Peru’s emissions level (excl. LULUCF) is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels again in 2030. Since July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s has changed his government’s ministerial cabinet five times, adding to the feeling of political instability in the country and slowing down policy development overall.

Our analysis shows that Peru could reach its unconditional NDC target under current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to their fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to implement policies that are fully in line with decarbonisation.

## Policy overview

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have increased by 90% from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2021). According to our calculations, national emissions experienced a 6% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 levels as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions quickly bounced back in 2021, leading to similar emissions levels as those we had estimated before the pandemic, despite the initial drop. We estimate emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). Under current policy projections, Peru will overachieve its unconditional 2030 target, but will need to implement further, more ambitious policies in order to reach its conditional target.

In July 2021, Pedro Castillo, a public-school teacher and union leader from rural Peru, assumed the presidency of the country, against all odds. One year on, Castillo faces corruption allegations, a 70% disapproval rating and strong and organised opposition in congress. So far, Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts, changed his cabinet of ministers for a fifth time, and is now dealing with national strikes in response to the increasing costs of fuel, fertiliser and food linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, the feeling of political instability and low trust in the current government led to very slow progress in advancing climate policy (Giardino, 2022).

In the energy sector, the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite continued investments in fossil fuels. Early this year, the government agreed the country’s first green hydrogen project, in the south of the country, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).

At the same time, in July 2022, the government approved the license contract for the oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset (Peru Energia, 2022a). According a study from the IEA, new investments in oil and gas are incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These new investments not only risk stranded assets for the country in the future but its at odds with the Climate Change National Strategy currently under development, which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, this comes after what was labelled as the worst environmental disaster on the country’s coastline in January this year when an underwater oil pipeline owned by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, caused a spill of over 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean. The spill took place north of the capital, Lima, but wind and currents spread it until it covered over 100 km2, polluting three protected marine reserves, several beaches and killing fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Collyns, 2022). The company now faces a $4.5 billion civil lawsuit for environmental damage and harm to locals and consumers (Reuters, 2022).

In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 was the year with the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.

Other relevant developments include the approval of the regulation of the framework law on climate change at the end of 2019, which makes Peru’s NDC pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020). In July 2020, the government established a high-level climate change committee, including members of 13 ministries, which will inform the setting of climate related targets and report to the UNFCCC on progress (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020d).

In October 2021, Peru and Switzerland signed a carbon credit agreement where Switzerland will finance emission reduction projects designed to contribute to sustainable development in Peru, while the emissions reductions would count towards the Swiss NDC (Climate Home News, 2020). To ensure environmental integrity, both Peru and Switzerland would have to put in place robust accounting systems so that the reductions are only counted once. Although the main rules and oversight provisions for such transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were initially agreed at COP26, the details for their implementation still need to be worked out. While no progress has been reported on this deal so far, the agreement has been criticised for posing a risk for Peru’s mitigation in the long-term, as achieving further mitigation reductions in the future will become more difficult (NewClimate Institute, 2021).

Peru was hit particularly hit by the pandemic. The country’s per capita fatality rate was one of the highest in the world and it also led to one of Peru’s worst economic crises, with a reported 11% drop in its GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2022; KfW Development Bank, 2020).

The government estimates that national emissions in 2020 were ~1.6 MtCO2e lower than in 2019 due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown, the lower electricity consumption in the production and commerce sectors and the cancellation of internal flights (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c). Based on our calculations (using IMF growth rate, see assumptions section), we estimate a difference of ~6 MtCO2e between 2019 and 2020 for the entire energy sector.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, four sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9%—or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Peru signed the methane pledge at COP26. According to the latest emissions inventory, methane emissions in Peru represent about 32 MtCO2e or 15% of total emissions (incl. LULUCF), with 50% coming from agriculture. The energy sector contributes to 28% of the country’s methane emissions, and the waste sector with the remaining 22% (INGEI, 2021). Although the new NDC indicates it covers all gases and sectors, the methane pledge is not explicitly referenced, nor does it include any specific action on methane emissions. Reducing 30% of current methane emissions could roughly translate into an 8 MtCO2e reduction by 2030 which could potentially lead to lower emissions level than that under the unconditional NDC.
- **Forestry:** Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use at COP26. However, that same year, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rates in the last two decades (see forestry section below for more details). In the past, Peru also endorsed other initiatives linked to reducing deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests (signed in 2014).

## Energy supply

In 2019, the energy sector emitted ~34 MtCO2e (excluding emissions from the transport sector), it represented 34% of total emissions and is the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Policies that aim to mitigate these emissions include the policy for ‘promotion of investment for the generation of electricity from renewable energy’, which builds on the National Strategy on Climate Change and prioritises renewable energy generation as a matter of national interest and public necessity.

In 2019, renewables accounted for 24% of Peru’s total primary energy supply (TPES). Over 50% of this share came from biofuels and waste and just over 40% comes from hydro; wind and solar contribute only 4% to the overall share of renewables (IEA, 2019). Oil and gas made up 73% of the supply in the same year, and increase compared to a 64% share in 2010. In terms of electricity generation, in 2020, 58% of the country’s power came from hydro, a significant increase from a share of 49% in 2015. Solar and wind added up to a 5% contribution, compared to a 1% share in 2015. The other important source of electricity is natural gas with a share of 35% in 2020 (IEA, 2019).

The share of renewables in TPES and in electricity generation has been steadily increasing over the years in response to the four renewable energy auctions held since 2009 (El Comercio, 2017). In January 2022, the government announced it would offer two more auctions on solar and wind, totalling around 2000 MW capacity (Energia Estrategica, 2022).

The government continues to expand oil and gas exploration and extraction. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves, producing approximately 10,500 barrels/day (Peru Energia, 2022a).

In March 2022, the vice-Ministry of Electricity signed an agreement to promote the development of green hydrogen in the country. Now the first green hydrogen project is planned for the southern coast of the country, with a pilot phase expected to produce up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day, requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. According to the green hydrogen roadmap, the hydrogen industry has the potential to create up to 94,000 jobs in the country by 2050 (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector emitted ~20 MtCO2e, which represent 19% of Peru’s total national emissions (excl. LULUCF) and 36% of the country’s energy-related emissions; it is the largest contributor to the sector’s emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Peru was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, especially in its first year when the government implemented a strict lockdown period which included the complete immobilisation of the population for weeks. The government now estimates that emissions from the transport sector in 2020 were ~0.6 MtCO2e lower due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c).

To help mitigate the rapid increase in transport emissions, Peru has implemented a range of policies over the years, plus some additional developments in the context of the pandemic:

- In 2020, the government approved a decree that sets tax incentives to promote the acquisition of hybrid or electric vehicles by an accelerated depreciation of up to 50% per year (Decreto Legislativo Que Establece Un Régimen Especial de Depreciación y Modifica Plazos de Depreciación, 2020; PLATFORM for REDESIGN, 2020)
- In the same year, the government approved by law the National Programme for Sustainable Urban Transport, which supports the development of cycling infrastructure, referred to as low-emissions and low-risk mode of transport (Decreto Supremo Que Crea El Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano Sostenible, 2019).
- Full implementation of the second phase of the Lima Metro Network (Line 2) is expected to be completed by 2024 (Andina, 2020)
- COFIGAS Programme, which supports the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas, which estimates that about 274,000 vehicles were converted to gas since the start of the program until end of 2018 (COFIDE, 2019)
- An emissions standards Decree (updated in 2017) which establishes maximum permissible limits of atmospheric emissions for vehicles and mandates that as of 1 April 2018, vehicle emission standards will be Euro 4/IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 (Government of Peru, 2017; UNEP, 2017).

## Buildings

Cities across the country have been rapidly and disorderly growing over the last decade, paying little to no attention to climate-friendly construction guidelines. In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019).

In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no. 009-2017-EM) and in 2015, a Sustainable Construction Code to improve technical criteria for the design and construction of public and private buildings was approved (Supreme Decree no. 015-2015-VIVIENDA).

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years.

Although the government had been reporting lower annual deforestation rates since 2016, this remains a critical problem in Peru. This decreasing deforestation trend reported between 2016 and 2019 was attributed to the work done under the National Forest Conservation Program, which was extended for ten more years and has set the target of protecting 10 million forest hectares by 2030. According to the government, this would reduce current deforestation rates by 30% (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020e).

However, in 2020, Peru reached its highest deforestation rate in 20 years. According to the National Forest Programme, the country lost 203,000 hectares of forest in 2020; over 50,000 hectares more than the previous year (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, although migration back to rural areas as a result of the economic crisis linked to the pandemic also played a role.

At COP26, Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use alongside over 145 other countries. The Declaration on Forests and Land Use aims to stop deforestation, as well as promote the conservation, protection and sustainable management of forests (UN Climate Change Conference 2021, 2021). While many celebrated the announcement, others seemed less optimistic of the potential impacts, while also highlighting the reluctance of some of the Declaration’s donors to take a harder line on the extractive and agricultural industries that have historically been the biggest threats to their societies (Mongabay, 2021).

Forests cover over two thirds of the national territory, Peru hosts about 740,000 square kilometres of forests, including the largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil (World Bank, 2021). In Peru, land use and forestry is the main source of emissions, with a share of almost 53% reported for 2016 (INGEI, 2021). To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, the rate of deforestation worldwide needs to decline 70% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, compared to 2018 levels (State of climate action 2021).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2019 are taken from PRIMAPhist (Gütschow et al., 2021).

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied the following approach: For the energy and industry sectors, we assumed a directly proportional development of these sectors’ emissions with GDP growth rates from IMF for 2020–2021. For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.

The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).


## NDC and other targets

The pledge for 2030 is based on the latest NDC submission document from December 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). Peru’s submission covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The previous NDC covered only CO2, CH4 and N2O, for all sectors.

An absolute emissions level, including LULUCF, is provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional and conditional targets. To distinguish emissions reductions that are attributable to the LULUCF sector, the CAT assumes that the share of LULUCF mitigation efforts will be the same as it was in the first NDC submission, for both unconditional and conditional targets.

The assessment of Peru’s first NDC considers the mitigation split presented in the roadmap for NDC implementation (Government of Peru, 2018). According to the technical background document of the first NDC, for the unconditional target, 76% of the 20% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained from measures in the LULUCF sector. For the conditional target, 69% of the 30% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained in the LULUCF sector.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections for total energy-related CO2 emissions is based on the BAU scenario from the 7th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2019). APEC’s BAU scenario assumes that electricity generation will grow by 69% until 2050 due to rapid economic growth, while electricity capacity will increase by 48%. Peru’s generation mix remains dominated by hydropower and gas-fired generation, with wind and solar power together accounting for 6.7% in 2050. This scenario assumes that Peru becomes a net natural gas importer around 2039 as demand rises rapidly and domestic natural gas production declines with the depletion of the Camisea field.

The APEC scenarios use historical energy and CO2 data derived from IEA Energy Balances of non-OECD countries and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The harmonisation of APEC energy-related CO2 with historical data from PRIMAP-hist results in about a 6 MtCO2e decrease in emissions projections for 2030.

Non-CO2 emissions were taken directly from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 and 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Other CO2 emissions were estimated based on their share in the last inventory with data until 2016 (INGEI, 2021) and their expected contribution under BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020a). Data was interpolated linearly in between years and harmonised with historical data.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target overview

In its NDC, Peru sets an unconditional target to not exceed an emissions level of 208.8 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). The CAT excluded emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target and converted it to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GWP values (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2030 target of up to 122.7 MtCO2e in 2030. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” compared to Peru’s fair share.

The NDC also includes a conditional target to limit emissions to 179.0 MtCO2e by 2030. Once again, the CAT excluded LULUCF emissions from the target and converted the SAR GWP values to AR4, resulting in a target of 107.7 MtCO2e by 2030. This represents a 15 MtCO2e reduction below the unconditional target (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to what is needed to happen domestically, will international support. Peru’s NDC states an intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but it is still in the process of developing its long-term strategy.


## NDC updates

On December 18, 2020 Peru submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC that represents progress beyond its previous submission but that is still incompatible with limiting global warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, let alone with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The regulation of the framework law on climate change (approved at the end of 2019), makes Peru’s Paris Agreement pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020).

With its new target, Peru commits to limiting emissions to about 123 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, according to our calculations. This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target.

Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). This represents a step forward compared to the first submission, leading to an 8% lower emissions level by 2030 and increasing the target format’s strength from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. No further details have been provided for the conditional target (e.g., sectoral contributions to the target), making it difficult to assess.

The new NDC provides fewer details than the previous one in terms of the expected emissions reduction contribution of each sector and, more importantly, of the LULUCF sector (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). In general, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its climate targets as much as possible, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land.

Additionally, the new NDC states that Peru will update its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. The updated strategy, its objectives and main indicators are currently undergoing public consultation (as of August, 2022) and the final document is expected to be approved by the government by, at the latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a, 2022b).

According to our calculations, the new unconditional NDC target could be reached with the implementation of current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. This highlights a missed opportunity for Peru to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable but ambitious targets that are aligned with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

The increase in mitigation ambition of the new NDC is not enough to improve Peru’s rating. The CAT rates both Peru’s unconditional and conditional targets, as “Insufficient”.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 18.12.2020 “Peru’s updated NDC with an absolute emissions reduction target for 2030 and a net zero target for 2050"

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Peru will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Peru has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (unconditional), and one that requires international support (conditional). We rate the unconditional target against Peru’s fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share ’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate Peru’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. This update will be based on a Technical Study commissioned to explore pathways to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. No further details have been communicated so far, but in January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N° 003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved by, latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). Before that, government officials announced that the mid-century carbon neutrality target would be based on four national priorities (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020b):

- Transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable energy
- Electrification of the economy (less polluting transport, electromobility)
- Circular economy
- Nature-based solutions (sustainable use of natural resources).
This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its carbon neutrality target, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land. **For the full analysis** **click here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and** **has changed his ministerial cabinet five times****, adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall.**

**The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project.**

**However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a** **study from the IEA****, any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.**

**The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.**

**COP26 called for** **more ambitious NDCs**** to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account.**

The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share.

Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share.

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels).

In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset. This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate Peru’s unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together.

Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**

The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). As of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not yet submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Peru’s net zero target given the preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Peru provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Peru provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The Peruvian government stated its intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as part of its updated NDC in 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). The government is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy which is to include a net zero emissions target by 2050 and is expected to be approved by the government latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). The 2050 target year has so far been emphasized and referred to on different occasions by the Ministry of Environment (El Peruano, 2021). However, as of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Peru provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Peru provides no information on its intention to the planning of how to reach the net zero targets.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Peru provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Peru has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. According to our calculations, national emissions dropped 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions growth is rapidly picking up and Peru’s emissions level (excl. LULUCF) is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels again in 2030. Since July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s has changed his government’s ministerial cabinet five times, adding to the feeling of political instability in the country and slowing down policy development overall.

Our analysis shows that Peru could reach its unconditional NDC target under current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to their fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to implement policies that are fully in line with decarbonisation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have increased by 90% from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2021). According to our calculations, national emissions experienced a 6% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 levels as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions quickly bounced back in 2021, leading to similar emissions levels as those we had estimated before the pandemic, despite the initial drop. We estimate emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). Under current policy projections, Peru will overachieve its unconditional 2030 target, but will need to implement further, more ambitious policies in order to reach its conditional target.

In July 2021, Pedro Castillo, a public-school teacher and union leader from rural Peru, assumed the presidency of the country, against all odds. One year on, Castillo faces corruption allegations, a 70% disapproval rating and strong and organised opposition in congress. So far, Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts, changed his cabinet of ministers for a fifth time, and is now dealing with national strikes in response to the increasing costs of fuel, fertiliser and food linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, the feeling of political instability and low trust in the current government led to very slow progress in advancing climate policy (Giardino, 2022).

In the energy sector, the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite continued investments in fossil fuels. Early this year, the government agreed the country’s first green hydrogen project, in the south of the country, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).

At the same time, in July 2022, the government approved the license contract for the oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset (Peru Energia, 2022a). According a study from the IEA, new investments in oil and gas are incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These new investments not only risk stranded assets for the country in the future but its at odds with the Climate Change National Strategy currently under development, which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, this comes after what was labelled as the worst environmental disaster on the country’s coastline in January this year when an underwater oil pipeline owned by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, caused a spill of over 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean. The spill took place north of the capital, Lima, but wind and currents spread it until it covered over 100 km2, polluting three protected marine reserves, several beaches and killing fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Collyns, 2022). The company now faces a $4.5 billion civil lawsuit for environmental damage and harm to locals and consumers (Reuters, 2022).

In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 was the year with the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.

Other relevant developments include the approval of the regulation of the framework law on climate change at the end of 2019, which makes Peru’s NDC pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020). In July 2020, the government established a high-level climate change committee, including members of 13 ministries, which will inform the setting of climate related targets and report to the UNFCCC on progress (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020d).

In October 2021, Peru and Switzerland signed a carbon credit agreement where Switzerland will finance emission reduction projects designed to contribute to sustainable development in Peru, while the emissions reductions would count towards the Swiss NDC (Climate Home News, 2020). To ensure environmental integrity, both Peru and Switzerland would have to put in place robust accounting systems so that the reductions are only counted once. Although the main rules and oversight provisions for such transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were initially agreed at COP26, the details for their implementation still need to be worked out. While no progress has been reported on this deal so far, the agreement has been criticised for posing a risk for Peru’s mitigation in the long-term, as achieving further mitigation reductions in the future will become more difficult (NewClimate Institute, 2021).

Peru was hit particularly hit by the pandemic. The country’s per capita fatality rate was one of the highest in the world and it also led to one of Peru’s worst economic crises, with a reported 11% drop in its GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2022; KfW Development Bank, 2020).

The government estimates that national emissions in 2020 were ~1.6 MtCO2e lower than in 2019 due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown, the lower electricity consumption in the production and commerce sectors and the cancellation of internal flights (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c). Based on our calculations (using IMF growth rate, see assumptions section), we estimate a difference of ~6 MtCO2e between 2019 and 2020 for the entire energy sector.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, four sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9%—or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Peru signed the methane pledge at COP26. According to the latest emissions inventory, methane emissions in Peru represent about 32 MtCO2e or 15% of total emissions (incl. LULUCF), with 50% coming from agriculture. The energy sector contributes to 28% of the country’s methane emissions, and the waste sector with the remaining 22% (INGEI, 2021). Although the new NDC indicates it covers all gases and sectors, the methane pledge is not explicitly referenced, nor does it include any specific action on methane emissions. Reducing 30% of current methane emissions could roughly translate into an 8 MtCO2e reduction by 2030 which could potentially lead to lower emissions level than that under the unconditional NDC.
- **Forestry:** Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use at COP26. However, that same year, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rates in the last two decades (see forestry section below for more details). In the past, Peru also endorsed other initiatives linked to reducing deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests (signed in 2014).

## Energy supply

In 2019, the energy sector emitted ~34 MtCO2e (excluding emissions from the transport sector), it represented 34% of total emissions and is the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Policies that aim to mitigate these emissions include the policy for ‘promotion of investment for the generation of electricity from renewable energy’, which builds on the National Strategy on Climate Change and prioritises renewable energy generation as a matter of national interest and public necessity.

In 2019, renewables accounted for 24% of Peru’s total primary energy supply (TPES). Over 50% of this share came from biofuels and waste and just over 40% comes from hydro; wind and solar contribute only 4% to the overall share of renewables (IEA, 2019). Oil and gas made up 73% of the supply in the same year, and increase compared to a 64% share in 2010. In terms of electricity generation, in 2020, 58% of the country’s power came from hydro, a significant increase from a share of 49% in 2015. Solar and wind added up to a 5% contribution, compared to a 1% share in 2015. The other important source of electricity is natural gas with a share of 35% in 2020 (IEA, 2019).

The share of renewables in TPES and in electricity generation has been steadily increasing over the years in response to the four renewable energy auctions held since 2009 (El Comercio, 2017). In January 2022, the government announced it would offer two more auctions on solar and wind, totalling around 2000 MW capacity (Energia Estrategica, 2022).

The government continues to expand oil and gas exploration and extraction. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves, producing approximately 10,500 barrels/day (Peru Energia, 2022a).

In March 2022, the vice-Ministry of Electricity signed an agreement to promote the development of green hydrogen in the country. Now the first green hydrogen project is planned for the southern coast of the country, with a pilot phase expected to produce up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day, requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. According to the green hydrogen roadmap, the hydrogen industry has the potential to create up to 94,000 jobs in the country by 2050 (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector emitted ~20 MtCO2e, which represent 19% of Peru’s total national emissions (excl. LULUCF) and 36% of the country’s energy-related emissions; it is the largest contributor to the sector’s emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Peru was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, especially in its first year when the government implemented a strict lockdown period which included the complete immobilisation of the population for weeks. The government now estimates that emissions from the transport sector in 2020 were ~0.6 MtCO2e lower due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c).

To help mitigate the rapid increase in transport emissions, Peru has implemented a range of policies over the years, plus some additional developments in the context of the pandemic:

- In 2020, the government approved a decree that sets tax incentives to promote the acquisition of hybrid or electric vehicles by an accelerated depreciation of up to 50% per year (Decreto Legislativo Que Establece Un Régimen Especial de Depreciación y Modifica Plazos de Depreciación, 2020; PLATFORM for REDESIGN, 2020)
- In the same year, the government approved by law the National Programme for Sustainable Urban Transport, which supports the development of cycling infrastructure, referred to as low-emissions and low-risk mode of transport (Decreto Supremo Que Crea El Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano Sostenible, 2019).
- Full implementation of the second phase of the Lima Metro Network (Line 2) is expected to be completed by 2024 (Andina, 2020)
- COFIGAS Programme, which supports the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas, which estimates that about 274,000 vehicles were converted to gas since the start of the program until end of 2018 (COFIDE, 2019)
- An emissions standards Decree (updated in 2017) which establishes maximum permissible limits of atmospheric emissions for vehicles and mandates that as of 1 April 2018, vehicle emission standards will be Euro 4/IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 (Government of Peru, 2017; UNEP, 2017).

## Buildings

Cities across the country have been rapidly and disorderly growing over the last decade, paying little to no attention to climate-friendly construction guidelines. In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019).

In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no. 009-2017-EM) and in 2015, a Sustainable Construction Code to improve technical criteria for the design and construction of public and private buildings was approved (Supreme Decree no. 015-2015-VIVIENDA).

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years.

Although the government had been reporting lower annual deforestation rates since 2016, this remains a critical problem in Peru. This decreasing deforestation trend reported between 2016 and 2019 was attributed to the work done under the National Forest Conservation Program, which was extended for ten more years and has set the target of protecting 10 million forest hectares by 2030. According to the government, this would reduce current deforestation rates by 30% (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020e).

However, in 2020, Peru reached its highest deforestation rate in 20 years. According to the National Forest Programme, the country lost 203,000 hectares of forest in 2020; over 50,000 hectares more than the previous year (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, although migration back to rural areas as a result of the economic crisis linked to the pandemic also played a role.

At COP26, Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use alongside over 145 other countries. The Declaration on Forests and Land Use aims to stop deforestation, as well as promote the conservation, protection and sustainable management of forests (UN Climate Change Conference 2021, 2021). While many celebrated the announcement, others seemed less optimistic of the potential impacts, while also highlighting the reluctance of some of the Declaration’s donors to take a harder line on the extractive and agricultural industries that have historically been the biggest threats to their societies (Mongabay, 2021).

Forests cover over two thirds of the national territory, Peru hosts about 740,000 square kilometres of forests, including the largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil (World Bank, 2021). In Peru, land use and forestry is the main source of emissions, with a share of almost 53% reported for 2016 (INGEI, 2021). To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, the rate of deforestation worldwide needs to decline 70% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, compared to 2018 levels (State of climate action 2021).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2019 are taken from PRIMAPhist (Gütschow et al., 2021).

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied the following approach: For the energy and industry sectors, we assumed a directly proportional development of these sectors’ emissions with GDP growth rates from IMF for 2020–2021. For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.

The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).


## NDC and other targets

The pledge for 2030 is based on the latest NDC submission document from December 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). Peru’s submission covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The previous NDC covered only CO2, CH4 and N2O, for all sectors.

An absolute emissions level, including LULUCF, is provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional and conditional targets. To distinguish emissions reductions that are attributable to the LULUCF sector, the CAT assumes that the share of LULUCF mitigation efforts will be the same as it was in the first NDC submission, for both unconditional and conditional targets.

The assessment of Peru’s first NDC considers the mitigation split presented in the roadmap for NDC implementation (Government of Peru, 2018). According to the technical background document of the first NDC, for the unconditional target, 76% of the 20% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained from measures in the LULUCF sector. For the conditional target, 69% of the 30% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained in the LULUCF sector.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections for total energy-related CO2 emissions is based on the BAU scenario from the 7th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2019). APEC’s BAU scenario assumes that electricity generation will grow by 69% until 2050 due to rapid economic growth, while electricity capacity will increase by 48%. Peru’s generation mix remains dominated by hydropower and gas-fired generation, with wind and solar power together accounting for 6.7% in 2050. This scenario assumes that Peru becomes a net natural gas importer around 2039 as demand rises rapidly and domestic natural gas production declines with the depletion of the Camisea field.

The APEC scenarios use historical energy and CO2 data derived from IEA Energy Balances of non-OECD countries and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The harmonisation of APEC energy-related CO2 with historical data from PRIMAP-hist results in about a 6 MtCO2e decrease in emissions projections for 2030.

Non-CO2 emissions were taken directly from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 and 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Other CO2 emissions were estimated based on their share in the last inventory with data until 2016 (INGEI, 2021) and their expected contribution under BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020a). Data was interpolated linearly in between years and harmonised with historical data.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target overview

In its NDC, Peru sets an unconditional target to not exceed an emissions level of 208.8 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). The CAT excluded emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target and converted it to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GWP values (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2030 target of up to 122.7 MtCO2e in 2030. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” compared to Peru’s fair share.

The NDC also includes a conditional target to limit emissions to 179.0 MtCO2e by 2030. Once again, the CAT excluded LULUCF emissions from the target and converted the SAR GWP values to AR4, resulting in a target of 107.7 MtCO2e by 2030. This represents a 15 MtCO2e reduction below the unconditional target (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to what is needed to happen domestically, will international support. Peru’s NDC states an intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but it is still in the process of developing its long-term strategy.


## NDC updates

On December 18, 2020 Peru submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC that represents progress beyond its previous submission but that is still incompatible with limiting global warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, let alone with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The regulation of the framework law on climate change (approved at the end of 2019), makes Peru’s Paris Agreement pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020).

With its new target, Peru commits to limiting emissions to about 123 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, according to our calculations. This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target.

Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). This represents a step forward compared to the first submission, leading to an 8% lower emissions level by 2030 and increasing the target format’s strength from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. No further details have been provided for the conditional target (e.g., sectoral contributions to the target), making it difficult to assess.

The new NDC provides fewer details than the previous one in terms of the expected emissions reduction contribution of each sector and, more importantly, of the LULUCF sector (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). In general, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its climate targets as much as possible, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land.

Additionally, the new NDC states that Peru will update its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. The updated strategy, its objectives and main indicators are currently undergoing public consultation (as of August, 2022) and the final document is expected to be approved by the government by, at the latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a, 2022b).

According to our calculations, the new unconditional NDC target could be reached with the implementation of current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. This highlights a missed opportunity for Peru to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable but ambitious targets that are aligned with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

The increase in mitigation ambition of the new NDC is not enough to improve Peru’s rating. The CAT rates both Peru’s unconditional and conditional targets, as “Insufficient”.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 18.12.2020 “Peru’s updated NDC with an absolute emissions reduction target for 2030 and a net zero target for 2050"

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Peru will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Peru has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (unconditional), and one that requires international support (conditional). We rate the unconditional target against Peru’s fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share ’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate Peru’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. This update will be based on a Technical Study commissioned to explore pathways to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. No further details have been communicated so far, but in January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N° 003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved by, latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). Before that, government officials announced that the mid-century carbon neutrality target would be based on four national priorities (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020b):

- Transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable energy
- Electrification of the economy (less polluting transport, electromobility)
- Circular economy
- Nature-based solutions (sustainable use of natural resources).
This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its carbon neutrality target, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land. **For the full analysis** **click here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and** **has changed his ministerial cabinet five times****, adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall.**

**The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project.**

**However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a** **study from the IEA****, any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.**

**The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.**

**COP26 called for** **more ambitious NDCs**** to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account.**

The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share.

Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share.

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels).

In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset. This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate Peru’s unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together.

Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**

The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). As of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not yet submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Peru’s net zero target given the preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Peru provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Peru provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The Peruvian government stated its intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as part of its updated NDC in 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). The government is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy which is to include a net zero emissions target by 2050 and is expected to be approved by the government latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). The 2050 target year has so far been emphasized and referred to on different occasions by the Ministry of Environment (El Peruano, 2021). However, as of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Peru provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Peru provides no information on its intention to the planning of how to reach the net zero targets.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Peru provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Peru has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. According to our calculations, national emissions dropped 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions growth is rapidly picking up and Peru’s emissions level (excl. LULUCF) is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels again in 2030. Since July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s has changed his government’s ministerial cabinet five times, adding to the feeling of political instability in the country and slowing down policy development overall.

Our analysis shows that Peru could reach its unconditional NDC target under current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to their fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to implement policies that are fully in line with decarbonisation.

## Policy overview

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have increased by 90% from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2021). According to our calculations, national emissions experienced a 6% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 levels as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions quickly bounced back in 2021, leading to similar emissions levels as those we had estimated before the pandemic, despite the initial drop. We estimate emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). Under current policy projections, Peru will overachieve its unconditional 2030 target, but will need to implement further, more ambitious policies in order to reach its conditional target.

In July 2021, Pedro Castillo, a public-school teacher and union leader from rural Peru, assumed the presidency of the country, against all odds. One year on, Castillo faces corruption allegations, a 70% disapproval rating and strong and organised opposition in congress. So far, Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts, changed his cabinet of ministers for a fifth time, and is now dealing with national strikes in response to the increasing costs of fuel, fertiliser and food linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, the feeling of political instability and low trust in the current government led to very slow progress in advancing climate policy (Giardino, 2022).

In the energy sector, the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite continued investments in fossil fuels. Early this year, the government agreed the country’s first green hydrogen project, in the south of the country, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).

At the same time, in July 2022, the government approved the license contract for the oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset (Peru Energia, 2022a). According a study from the IEA, new investments in oil and gas are incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These new investments not only risk stranded assets for the country in the future but its at odds with the Climate Change National Strategy currently under development, which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, this comes after what was labelled as the worst environmental disaster on the country’s coastline in January this year when an underwater oil pipeline owned by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, caused a spill of over 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean. The spill took place north of the capital, Lima, but wind and currents spread it until it covered over 100 km2, polluting three protected marine reserves, several beaches and killing fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Collyns, 2022). The company now faces a $4.5 billion civil lawsuit for environmental damage and harm to locals and consumers (Reuters, 2022).

In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 was the year with the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.

Other relevant developments include the approval of the regulation of the framework law on climate change at the end of 2019, which makes Peru’s NDC pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020). In July 2020, the government established a high-level climate change committee, including members of 13 ministries, which will inform the setting of climate related targets and report to the UNFCCC on progress (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020d).

In October 2021, Peru and Switzerland signed a carbon credit agreement where Switzerland will finance emission reduction projects designed to contribute to sustainable development in Peru, while the emissions reductions would count towards the Swiss NDC (Climate Home News, 2020). To ensure environmental integrity, both Peru and Switzerland would have to put in place robust accounting systems so that the reductions are only counted once. Although the main rules and oversight provisions for such transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were initially agreed at COP26, the details for their implementation still need to be worked out. While no progress has been reported on this deal so far, the agreement has been criticised for posing a risk for Peru’s mitigation in the long-term, as achieving further mitigation reductions in the future will become more difficult (NewClimate Institute, 2021).

Peru was hit particularly hit by the pandemic. The country’s per capita fatality rate was one of the highest in the world and it also led to one of Peru’s worst economic crises, with a reported 11% drop in its GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2022; KfW Development Bank, 2020).

The government estimates that national emissions in 2020 were ~1.6 MtCO2e lower than in 2019 due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown, the lower electricity consumption in the production and commerce sectors and the cancellation of internal flights (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c). Based on our calculations (using IMF growth rate, see assumptions section), we estimate a difference of ~6 MtCO2e between 2019 and 2020 for the entire energy sector.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, four sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9%—or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Peru signed the methane pledge at COP26. According to the latest emissions inventory, methane emissions in Peru represent about 32 MtCO2e or 15% of total emissions (incl. LULUCF), with 50% coming from agriculture. The energy sector contributes to 28% of the country’s methane emissions, and the waste sector with the remaining 22% (INGEI, 2021). Although the new NDC indicates it covers all gases and sectors, the methane pledge is not explicitly referenced, nor does it include any specific action on methane emissions. Reducing 30% of current methane emissions could roughly translate into an 8 MtCO2e reduction by 2030 which could potentially lead to lower emissions level than that under the unconditional NDC.
- **Forestry:** Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use at COP26. However, that same year, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rates in the last two decades (see forestry section below for more details). In the past, Peru also endorsed other initiatives linked to reducing deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests (signed in 2014).

## Energy supply

In 2019, the energy sector emitted ~34 MtCO2e (excluding emissions from the transport sector), it represented 34% of total emissions and is the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Policies that aim to mitigate these emissions include the policy for ‘promotion of investment for the generation of electricity from renewable energy’, which builds on the National Strategy on Climate Change and prioritises renewable energy generation as a matter of national interest and public necessity.

In 2019, renewables accounted for 24% of Peru’s total primary energy supply (TPES). Over 50% of this share came from biofuels and waste and just over 40% comes from hydro; wind and solar contribute only 4% to the overall share of renewables (IEA, 2019). Oil and gas made up 73% of the supply in the same year, and increase compared to a 64% share in 2010. In terms of electricity generation, in 2020, 58% of the country’s power came from hydro, a significant increase from a share of 49% in 2015. Solar and wind added up to a 5% contribution, compared to a 1% share in 2015. The other important source of electricity is natural gas with a share of 35% in 2020 (IEA, 2019).

The share of renewables in TPES and in electricity generation has been steadily increasing over the years in response to the four renewable energy auctions held since 2009 (El Comercio, 2017). In January 2022, the government announced it would offer two more auctions on solar and wind, totalling around 2000 MW capacity (Energia Estrategica, 2022).

The government continues to expand oil and gas exploration and extraction. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves, producing approximately 10,500 barrels/day (Peru Energia, 2022a).

In March 2022, the vice-Ministry of Electricity signed an agreement to promote the development of green hydrogen in the country. Now the first green hydrogen project is planned for the southern coast of the country, with a pilot phase expected to produce up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day, requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. According to the green hydrogen roadmap, the hydrogen industry has the potential to create up to 94,000 jobs in the country by 2050 (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector emitted ~20 MtCO2e, which represent 19% of Peru’s total national emissions (excl. LULUCF) and 36% of the country’s energy-related emissions; it is the largest contributor to the sector’s emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Peru was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, especially in its first year when the government implemented a strict lockdown period which included the complete immobilisation of the population for weeks. The government now estimates that emissions from the transport sector in 2020 were ~0.6 MtCO2e lower due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c).

To help mitigate the rapid increase in transport emissions, Peru has implemented a range of policies over the years, plus some additional developments in the context of the pandemic:

- In 2020, the government approved a decree that sets tax incentives to promote the acquisition of hybrid or electric vehicles by an accelerated depreciation of up to 50% per year (Decreto Legislativo Que Establece Un Régimen Especial de Depreciación y Modifica Plazos de Depreciación, 2020; PLATFORM for REDESIGN, 2020)
- In the same year, the government approved by law the National Programme for Sustainable Urban Transport, which supports the development of cycling infrastructure, referred to as low-emissions and low-risk mode of transport (Decreto Supremo Que Crea El Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano Sostenible, 2019).
- Full implementation of the second phase of the Lima Metro Network (Line 2) is expected to be completed by 2024 (Andina, 2020)
- COFIGAS Programme, which supports the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas, which estimates that about 274,000 vehicles were converted to gas since the start of the program until end of 2018 (COFIDE, 2019)
- An emissions standards Decree (updated in 2017) which establishes maximum permissible limits of atmospheric emissions for vehicles and mandates that as of 1 April 2018, vehicle emission standards will be Euro 4/IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 (Government of Peru, 2017; UNEP, 2017).

## Buildings

Cities across the country have been rapidly and disorderly growing over the last decade, paying little to no attention to climate-friendly construction guidelines. In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019).

In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no. 009-2017-EM) and in 2015, a Sustainable Construction Code to improve technical criteria for the design and construction of public and private buildings was approved (Supreme Decree no. 015-2015-VIVIENDA).

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years.

Although the government had been reporting lower annual deforestation rates since 2016, this remains a critical problem in Peru. This decreasing deforestation trend reported between 2016 and 2019 was attributed to the work done under the National Forest Conservation Program, which was extended for ten more years and has set the target of protecting 10 million forest hectares by 2030. According to the government, this would reduce current deforestation rates by 30% (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020e).

However, in 2020, Peru reached its highest deforestation rate in 20 years. According to the National Forest Programme, the country lost 203,000 hectares of forest in 2020; over 50,000 hectares more than the previous year (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, although migration back to rural areas as a result of the economic crisis linked to the pandemic also played a role.

At COP26, Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use alongside over 145 other countries. The Declaration on Forests and Land Use aims to stop deforestation, as well as promote the conservation, protection and sustainable management of forests (UN Climate Change Conference 2021, 2021). While many celebrated the announcement, others seemed less optimistic of the potential impacts, while also highlighting the reluctance of some of the Declaration’s donors to take a harder line on the extractive and agricultural industries that have historically been the biggest threats to their societies (Mongabay, 2021).

Forests cover over two thirds of the national territory, Peru hosts about 740,000 square kilometres of forests, including the largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil (World Bank, 2021). In Peru, land use and forestry is the main source of emissions, with a share of almost 53% reported for 2016 (INGEI, 2021). To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, the rate of deforestation worldwide needs to decline 70% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, compared to 2018 levels (State of climate action 2021).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2019 are taken from PRIMAPhist (Gütschow et al., 2021).

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied the following approach: For the energy and industry sectors, we assumed a directly proportional development of these sectors’ emissions with GDP growth rates from IMF for 2020–2021. For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.

The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).


## NDC and other targets

The pledge for 2030 is based on the latest NDC submission document from December 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). Peru’s submission covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The previous NDC covered only CO2, CH4 and N2O, for all sectors.

An absolute emissions level, including LULUCF, is provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional and conditional targets. To distinguish emissions reductions that are attributable to the LULUCF sector, the CAT assumes that the share of LULUCF mitigation efforts will be the same as it was in the first NDC submission, for both unconditional and conditional targets.

The assessment of Peru’s first NDC considers the mitigation split presented in the roadmap for NDC implementation (Government of Peru, 2018). According to the technical background document of the first NDC, for the unconditional target, 76% of the 20% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained from measures in the LULUCF sector. For the conditional target, 69% of the 30% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained in the LULUCF sector.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections for total energy-related CO2 emissions is based on the BAU scenario from the 7th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2019). APEC’s BAU scenario assumes that electricity generation will grow by 69% until 2050 due to rapid economic growth, while electricity capacity will increase by 48%. Peru’s generation mix remains dominated by hydropower and gas-fired generation, with wind and solar power together accounting for 6.7% in 2050. This scenario assumes that Peru becomes a net natural gas importer around 2039 as demand rises rapidly and domestic natural gas production declines with the depletion of the Camisea field.

The APEC scenarios use historical energy and CO2 data derived from IEA Energy Balances of non-OECD countries and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The harmonisation of APEC energy-related CO2 with historical data from PRIMAP-hist results in about a 6 MtCO2e decrease in emissions projections for 2030.

Non-CO2 emissions were taken directly from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 and 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Other CO2 emissions were estimated based on their share in the last inventory with data until 2016 (INGEI, 2021) and their expected contribution under BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020a). Data was interpolated linearly in between years and harmonised with historical data.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target overview

In its NDC, Peru sets an unconditional target to not exceed an emissions level of 208.8 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). The CAT excluded emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target and converted it to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GWP values (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2030 target of up to 122.7 MtCO2e in 2030. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” compared to Peru’s fair share.

The NDC also includes a conditional target to limit emissions to 179.0 MtCO2e by 2030. Once again, the CAT excluded LULUCF emissions from the target and converted the SAR GWP values to AR4, resulting in a target of 107.7 MtCO2e by 2030. This represents a 15 MtCO2e reduction below the unconditional target (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to what is needed to happen domestically, will international support. Peru’s NDC states an intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but it is still in the process of developing its long-term strategy.


## NDC updates

On December 18, 2020 Peru submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC that represents progress beyond its previous submission but that is still incompatible with limiting global warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, let alone with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The regulation of the framework law on climate change (approved at the end of 2019), makes Peru’s Paris Agreement pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020).

With its new target, Peru commits to limiting emissions to about 123 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, according to our calculations. This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target.

Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). This represents a step forward compared to the first submission, leading to an 8% lower emissions level by 2030 and increasing the target format’s strength from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. No further details have been provided for the conditional target (e.g., sectoral contributions to the target), making it difficult to assess.

The new NDC provides fewer details than the previous one in terms of the expected emissions reduction contribution of each sector and, more importantly, of the LULUCF sector (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). In general, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its climate targets as much as possible, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land.

Additionally, the new NDC states that Peru will update its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. The updated strategy, its objectives and main indicators are currently undergoing public consultation (as of August, 2022) and the final document is expected to be approved by the government by, at the latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a, 2022b).

According to our calculations, the new unconditional NDC target could be reached with the implementation of current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. This highlights a missed opportunity for Peru to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable but ambitious targets that are aligned with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

The increase in mitigation ambition of the new NDC is not enough to improve Peru’s rating. The CAT rates both Peru’s unconditional and conditional targets, as “Insufficient”.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 18.12.2020 “Peru’s updated NDC with an absolute emissions reduction target for 2030 and a net zero target for 2050"

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Peru will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Peru has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (unconditional), and one that requires international support (conditional). We rate the unconditional target against Peru’s fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share ’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate Peru’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. This update will be based on a Technical Study commissioned to explore pathways to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. No further details have been communicated so far, but in January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N° 003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved by, latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). Before that, government officials announced that the mid-century carbon neutrality target would be based on four national priorities (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020b):

- Transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable energy
- Electrification of the economy (less polluting transport, electromobility)
- Circular economy
- Nature-based solutions (sustainable use of natural resources).
This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its carbon neutrality target, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land. **For the full analysis** **click here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and** **has changed his ministerial cabinet five times****, adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall.**

**The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project.**

**However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a** **study from the IEA****, any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.**

**The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.**

**COP26 called for** **more ambitious NDCs**** to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account.**

The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share.

Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share.

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels).

In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset. This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate Peru’s unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together.

Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**

The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). As of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not yet submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Peru’s net zero target given the preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Peru provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Peru provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The Peruvian government stated its intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as part of its updated NDC in 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). The government is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy which is to include a net zero emissions target by 2050 and is expected to be approved by the government latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). The 2050 target year has so far been emphasized and referred to on different occasions by the Ministry of Environment (El Peruano, 2021). However, as of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Peru provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Peru provides no information on its intention to the planning of how to reach the net zero targets.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Peru provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Peru has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. According to our calculations, national emissions dropped 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions growth is rapidly picking up and Peru’s emissions level (excl. LULUCF) is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels again in 2030. Since July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s has changed his government’s ministerial cabinet five times, adding to the feeling of political instability in the country and slowing down policy development overall.

Our analysis shows that Peru could reach its unconditional NDC target under current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to their fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to implement policies that are fully in line with decarbonisation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have increased by 90% from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2021). According to our calculations, national emissions experienced a 6% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 levels as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions quickly bounced back in 2021, leading to similar emissions levels as those we had estimated before the pandemic, despite the initial drop. We estimate emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). Under current policy projections, Peru will overachieve its unconditional 2030 target, but will need to implement further, more ambitious policies in order to reach its conditional target.

In July 2021, Pedro Castillo, a public-school teacher and union leader from rural Peru, assumed the presidency of the country, against all odds. One year on, Castillo faces corruption allegations, a 70% disapproval rating and strong and organised opposition in congress. So far, Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts, changed his cabinet of ministers for a fifth time, and is now dealing with national strikes in response to the increasing costs of fuel, fertiliser and food linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, the feeling of political instability and low trust in the current government led to very slow progress in advancing climate policy (Giardino, 2022).

In the energy sector, the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite continued investments in fossil fuels. Early this year, the government agreed the country’s first green hydrogen project, in the south of the country, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).

At the same time, in July 2022, the government approved the license contract for the oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset (Peru Energia, 2022a). According a study from the IEA, new investments in oil and gas are incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These new investments not only risk stranded assets for the country in the future but its at odds with the Climate Change National Strategy currently under development, which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, this comes after what was labelled as the worst environmental disaster on the country’s coastline in January this year when an underwater oil pipeline owned by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, caused a spill of over 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean. The spill took place north of the capital, Lima, but wind and currents spread it until it covered over 100 km2, polluting three protected marine reserves, several beaches and killing fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Collyns, 2022). The company now faces a $4.5 billion civil lawsuit for environmental damage and harm to locals and consumers (Reuters, 2022).

In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 was the year with the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.

Other relevant developments include the approval of the regulation of the framework law on climate change at the end of 2019, which makes Peru’s NDC pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020). In July 2020, the government established a high-level climate change committee, including members of 13 ministries, which will inform the setting of climate related targets and report to the UNFCCC on progress (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020d).

In October 2021, Peru and Switzerland signed a carbon credit agreement where Switzerland will finance emission reduction projects designed to contribute to sustainable development in Peru, while the emissions reductions would count towards the Swiss NDC (Climate Home News, 2020). To ensure environmental integrity, both Peru and Switzerland would have to put in place robust accounting systems so that the reductions are only counted once. Although the main rules and oversight provisions for such transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were initially agreed at COP26, the details for their implementation still need to be worked out. While no progress has been reported on this deal so far, the agreement has been criticised for posing a risk for Peru’s mitigation in the long-term, as achieving further mitigation reductions in the future will become more difficult (NewClimate Institute, 2021).

Peru was hit particularly hit by the pandemic. The country’s per capita fatality rate was one of the highest in the world and it also led to one of Peru’s worst economic crises, with a reported 11% drop in its GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2022; KfW Development Bank, 2020).

The government estimates that national emissions in 2020 were ~1.6 MtCO2e lower than in 2019 due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown, the lower electricity consumption in the production and commerce sectors and the cancellation of internal flights (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c). Based on our calculations (using IMF growth rate, see assumptions section), we estimate a difference of ~6 MtCO2e between 2019 and 2020 for the entire energy sector.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, four sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9%—or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Peru signed the methane pledge at COP26. According to the latest emissions inventory, methane emissions in Peru represent about 32 MtCO2e or 15% of total emissions (incl. LULUCF), with 50% coming from agriculture. The energy sector contributes to 28% of the country’s methane emissions, and the waste sector with the remaining 22% (INGEI, 2021). Although the new NDC indicates it covers all gases and sectors, the methane pledge is not explicitly referenced, nor does it include any specific action on methane emissions. Reducing 30% of current methane emissions could roughly translate into an 8 MtCO2e reduction by 2030 which could potentially lead to lower emissions level than that under the unconditional NDC.
- **Forestry:** Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use at COP26. However, that same year, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rates in the last two decades (see forestry section below for more details). In the past, Peru also endorsed other initiatives linked to reducing deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests (signed in 2014).

## Energy supply

In 2019, the energy sector emitted ~34 MtCO2e (excluding emissions from the transport sector), it represented 34% of total emissions and is the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Policies that aim to mitigate these emissions include the policy for ‘promotion of investment for the generation of electricity from renewable energy’, which builds on the National Strategy on Climate Change and prioritises renewable energy generation as a matter of national interest and public necessity.

In 2019, renewables accounted for 24% of Peru’s total primary energy supply (TPES). Over 50% of this share came from biofuels and waste and just over 40% comes from hydro; wind and solar contribute only 4% to the overall share of renewables (IEA, 2019). Oil and gas made up 73% of the supply in the same year, and increase compared to a 64% share in 2010. In terms of electricity generation, in 2020, 58% of the country’s power came from hydro, a significant increase from a share of 49% in 2015. Solar and wind added up to a 5% contribution, compared to a 1% share in 2015. The other important source of electricity is natural gas with a share of 35% in 2020 (IEA, 2019).

The share of renewables in TPES and in electricity generation has been steadily increasing over the years in response to the four renewable energy auctions held since 2009 (El Comercio, 2017). In January 2022, the government announced it would offer two more auctions on solar and wind, totalling around 2000 MW capacity (Energia Estrategica, 2022).

The government continues to expand oil and gas exploration and extraction. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves, producing approximately 10,500 barrels/day (Peru Energia, 2022a).

In March 2022, the vice-Ministry of Electricity signed an agreement to promote the development of green hydrogen in the country. Now the first green hydrogen project is planned for the southern coast of the country, with a pilot phase expected to produce up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day, requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. According to the green hydrogen roadmap, the hydrogen industry has the potential to create up to 94,000 jobs in the country by 2050 (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector emitted ~20 MtCO2e, which represent 19% of Peru’s total national emissions (excl. LULUCF) and 36% of the country’s energy-related emissions; it is the largest contributor to the sector’s emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Peru was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, especially in its first year when the government implemented a strict lockdown period which included the complete immobilisation of the population for weeks. The government now estimates that emissions from the transport sector in 2020 were ~0.6 MtCO2e lower due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c).

To help mitigate the rapid increase in transport emissions, Peru has implemented a range of policies over the years, plus some additional developments in the context of the pandemic:

- In 2020, the government approved a decree that sets tax incentives to promote the acquisition of hybrid or electric vehicles by an accelerated depreciation of up to 50% per year (Decreto Legislativo Que Establece Un Régimen Especial de Depreciación y Modifica Plazos de Depreciación, 2020; PLATFORM for REDESIGN, 2020)
- In the same year, the government approved by law the National Programme for Sustainable Urban Transport, which supports the development of cycling infrastructure, referred to as low-emissions and low-risk mode of transport (Decreto Supremo Que Crea El Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano Sostenible, 2019).
- Full implementation of the second phase of the Lima Metro Network (Line 2) is expected to be completed by 2024 (Andina, 2020)
- COFIGAS Programme, which supports the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas, which estimates that about 274,000 vehicles were converted to gas since the start of the program until end of 2018 (COFIDE, 2019)
- An emissions standards Decree (updated in 2017) which establishes maximum permissible limits of atmospheric emissions for vehicles and mandates that as of 1 April 2018, vehicle emission standards will be Euro 4/IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 (Government of Peru, 2017; UNEP, 2017).

## Buildings

Cities across the country have been rapidly and disorderly growing over the last decade, paying little to no attention to climate-friendly construction guidelines. In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019).

In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no. 009-2017-EM) and in 2015, a Sustainable Construction Code to improve technical criteria for the design and construction of public and private buildings was approved (Supreme Decree no. 015-2015-VIVIENDA).

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years.

Although the government had been reporting lower annual deforestation rates since 2016, this remains a critical problem in Peru. This decreasing deforestation trend reported between 2016 and 2019 was attributed to the work done under the National Forest Conservation Program, which was extended for ten more years and has set the target of protecting 10 million forest hectares by 2030. According to the government, this would reduce current deforestation rates by 30% (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020e).

However, in 2020, Peru reached its highest deforestation rate in 20 years. According to the National Forest Programme, the country lost 203,000 hectares of forest in 2020; over 50,000 hectares more than the previous year (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, although migration back to rural areas as a result of the economic crisis linked to the pandemic also played a role.

At COP26, Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use alongside over 145 other countries. The Declaration on Forests and Land Use aims to stop deforestation, as well as promote the conservation, protection and sustainable management of forests (UN Climate Change Conference 2021, 2021). While many celebrated the announcement, others seemed less optimistic of the potential impacts, while also highlighting the reluctance of some of the Declaration’s donors to take a harder line on the extractive and agricultural industries that have historically been the biggest threats to their societies (Mongabay, 2021).

Forests cover over two thirds of the national territory, Peru hosts about 740,000 square kilometres of forests, including the largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil (World Bank, 2021). In Peru, land use and forestry is the main source of emissions, with a share of almost 53% reported for 2016 (INGEI, 2021). To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, the rate of deforestation worldwide needs to decline 70% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, compared to 2018 levels (State of climate action 2021).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2019 are taken from PRIMAPhist (Gütschow et al., 2021).

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied the following approach: For the energy and industry sectors, we assumed a directly proportional development of these sectors’ emissions with GDP growth rates from IMF for 2020–2021. For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.

The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).


## NDC and other targets

The pledge for 2030 is based on the latest NDC submission document from December 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). Peru’s submission covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The previous NDC covered only CO2, CH4 and N2O, for all sectors.

An absolute emissions level, including LULUCF, is provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional and conditional targets. To distinguish emissions reductions that are attributable to the LULUCF sector, the CAT assumes that the share of LULUCF mitigation efforts will be the same as it was in the first NDC submission, for both unconditional and conditional targets.

The assessment of Peru’s first NDC considers the mitigation split presented in the roadmap for NDC implementation (Government of Peru, 2018). According to the technical background document of the first NDC, for the unconditional target, 76% of the 20% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained from measures in the LULUCF sector. For the conditional target, 69% of the 30% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained in the LULUCF sector.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections for total energy-related CO2 emissions is based on the BAU scenario from the 7th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2019). APEC’s BAU scenario assumes that electricity generation will grow by 69% until 2050 due to rapid economic growth, while electricity capacity will increase by 48%. Peru’s generation mix remains dominated by hydropower and gas-fired generation, with wind and solar power together accounting for 6.7% in 2050. This scenario assumes that Peru becomes a net natural gas importer around 2039 as demand rises rapidly and domestic natural gas production declines with the depletion of the Camisea field.

The APEC scenarios use historical energy and CO2 data derived from IEA Energy Balances of non-OECD countries and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The harmonisation of APEC energy-related CO2 with historical data from PRIMAP-hist results in about a 6 MtCO2e decrease in emissions projections for 2030.

Non-CO2 emissions were taken directly from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 and 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Other CO2 emissions were estimated based on their share in the last inventory with data until 2016 (INGEI, 2021) and their expected contribution under BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020a). Data was interpolated linearly in between years and harmonised with historical data.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target overview

In its NDC, Peru sets an unconditional target to not exceed an emissions level of 208.8 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). The CAT excluded emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target and converted it to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GWP values (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2030 target of up to 122.7 MtCO2e in 2030. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” compared to Peru’s fair share.

The NDC also includes a conditional target to limit emissions to 179.0 MtCO2e by 2030. Once again, the CAT excluded LULUCF emissions from the target and converted the SAR GWP values to AR4, resulting in a target of 107.7 MtCO2e by 2030. This represents a 15 MtCO2e reduction below the unconditional target (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to what is needed to happen domestically, will international support. Peru’s NDC states an intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but it is still in the process of developing its long-term strategy.


## NDC updates

On December 18, 2020 Peru submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC that represents progress beyond its previous submission but that is still incompatible with limiting global warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, let alone with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The regulation of the framework law on climate change (approved at the end of 2019), makes Peru’s Paris Agreement pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020).

With its new target, Peru commits to limiting emissions to about 123 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, according to our calculations. This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target.

Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). This represents a step forward compared to the first submission, leading to an 8% lower emissions level by 2030 and increasing the target format’s strength from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. No further details have been provided for the conditional target (e.g., sectoral contributions to the target), making it difficult to assess.

The new NDC provides fewer details than the previous one in terms of the expected emissions reduction contribution of each sector and, more importantly, of the LULUCF sector (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). In general, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its climate targets as much as possible, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land.

Additionally, the new NDC states that Peru will update its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. The updated strategy, its objectives and main indicators are currently undergoing public consultation (as of August, 2022) and the final document is expected to be approved by the government by, at the latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a, 2022b).

According to our calculations, the new unconditional NDC target could be reached with the implementation of current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. This highlights a missed opportunity for Peru to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable but ambitious targets that are aligned with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

The increase in mitigation ambition of the new NDC is not enough to improve Peru’s rating. The CAT rates both Peru’s unconditional and conditional targets, as “Insufficient”.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 18.12.2020 “Peru’s updated NDC with an absolute emissions reduction target for 2030 and a net zero target for 2050"

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Peru will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Peru has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (unconditional), and one that requires international support (conditional). We rate the unconditional target against Peru’s fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share ’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate Peru’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. This update will be based on a Technical Study commissioned to explore pathways to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. No further details have been communicated so far, but in January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N° 003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved by, latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). Before that, government officials announced that the mid-century carbon neutrality target would be based on four national priorities (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020b):

- Transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable energy
- Electrification of the economy (less polluting transport, electromobility)
- Circular economy
- Nature-based solutions (sustainable use of natural resources).
This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its carbon neutrality target, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land. **For the full analysis** **click here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and** **has changed his ministerial cabinet five times****, adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall.**

**The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project.**

**However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a** **study from the IEA****, any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.**

**The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.**

**COP26 called for** **more ambitious NDCs**** to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account.**

The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share.

Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share.

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels).

In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset. This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate Peru’s unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together.

Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**

The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). As of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not yet submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Peru’s net zero target given the preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Peru aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Peru provides no information on the target’s emission coverage.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Peru provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Peru provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The Peruvian government stated its intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as part of its updated NDC in 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). The government is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy which is to include a net zero emissions target by 2050 and is expected to be approved by the government latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). The 2050 target year has so far been emphasized and referred to on different occasions by the Ministry of Environment (El Peruano, 2021). However, as of August 2022, the Peruvian Government has not submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Peru provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Peru provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Peru provides no information on its intention to the planning of how to reach the net zero targets.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Peru provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Peru has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. According to our calculations, national emissions dropped 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions growth is rapidly picking up and Peru’s emissions level (excl. LULUCF) is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels again in 2030. Since July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s has changed his government’s ministerial cabinet five times, adding to the feeling of political instability in the country and slowing down policy development overall.

Our analysis shows that Peru could reach its unconditional NDC target under current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to their fair-share contribution.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to implement policies that are fully in line with decarbonisation.

## Policy overview

Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have increased by 90% from about 54 MtCO2e in 1990 to 102 MtCO2e in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2021). According to our calculations, national emissions experienced a 6% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 levels as a consequence of the pandemic.

However, emissions quickly bounced back in 2021, leading to similar emissions levels as those we had estimated before the pandemic, despite the initial drop. We estimate emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). Under current policy projections, Peru will overachieve its unconditional 2030 target, but will need to implement further, more ambitious policies in order to reach its conditional target.

In July 2021, Pedro Castillo, a public-school teacher and union leader from rural Peru, assumed the presidency of the country, against all odds. One year on, Castillo faces corruption allegations, a 70% disapproval rating and strong and organised opposition in congress. So far, Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts, changed his cabinet of ministers for a fifth time, and is now dealing with national strikes in response to the increasing costs of fuel, fertiliser and food linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, the feeling of political instability and low trust in the current government led to very slow progress in advancing climate policy (Giardino, 2022).

In the energy sector, the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite continued investments in fossil fuels. Early this year, the government agreed the country’s first green hydrogen project, in the south of the country, with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).

At the same time, in July 2022, the government approved the license contract for the oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset (Peru Energia, 2022a). According a study from the IEA, new investments in oil and gas are incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These new investments not only risk stranded assets for the country in the future but its at odds with the Climate Change National Strategy currently under development, which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, this comes after what was labelled as the worst environmental disaster on the country’s coastline in January this year when an underwater oil pipeline owned by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, caused a spill of over 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean. The spill took place north of the capital, Lima, but wind and currents spread it until it covered over 100 km2, polluting three protected marine reserves, several beaches and killing fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Collyns, 2022). The company now faces a $4.5 billion civil lawsuit for environmental damage and harm to locals and consumers (Reuters, 2022).

In the forestry sector, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 was the year with the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role.

Other relevant developments include the approval of the regulation of the framework law on climate change at the end of 2019, which makes Peru’s NDC pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020). In July 2020, the government established a high-level climate change committee, including members of 13 ministries, which will inform the setting of climate related targets and report to the UNFCCC on progress (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020d).

In October 2021, Peru and Switzerland signed a carbon credit agreement where Switzerland will finance emission reduction projects designed to contribute to sustainable development in Peru, while the emissions reductions would count towards the Swiss NDC (Climate Home News, 2020). To ensure environmental integrity, both Peru and Switzerland would have to put in place robust accounting systems so that the reductions are only counted once. Although the main rules and oversight provisions for such transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were initially agreed at COP26, the details for their implementation still need to be worked out. While no progress has been reported on this deal so far, the agreement has been criticised for posing a risk for Peru’s mitigation in the long-term, as achieving further mitigation reductions in the future will become more difficult (NewClimate Institute, 2021).

Peru was hit particularly hit by the pandemic. The country’s per capita fatality rate was one of the highest in the world and it also led to one of Peru’s worst economic crises, with a reported 11% drop in its GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2022; KfW Development Bank, 2020).

The government estimates that national emissions in 2020 were ~1.6 MtCO2e lower than in 2019 due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown, the lower electricity consumption in the production and commerce sectors and the cancellation of internal flights (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c). Based on our calculations (using IMF growth rate, see assumptions section), we estimate a difference of ~6 MtCO2e between 2019 and 2020 for the entire energy sector.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, four sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9%—or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Peru signed the methane pledge at COP26. According to the latest emissions inventory, methane emissions in Peru represent about 32 MtCO2e or 15% of total emissions (incl. LULUCF), with 50% coming from agriculture. The energy sector contributes to 28% of the country’s methane emissions, and the waste sector with the remaining 22% (INGEI, 2021). Although the new NDC indicates it covers all gases and sectors, the methane pledge is not explicitly referenced, nor does it include any specific action on methane emissions. Reducing 30% of current methane emissions could roughly translate into an 8 MtCO2e reduction by 2030 which could potentially lead to lower emissions level than that under the unconditional NDC.
- **Forestry:** Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use at COP26. However, that same year, the National Forest Programme reported that 2020 saw the highest deforestation rates in the last two decades (see forestry section below for more details). In the past, Peru also endorsed other initiatives linked to reducing deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests (signed in 2014).

## Energy supply

In 2019, the energy sector emitted ~34 MtCO2e (excluding emissions from the transport sector), it represented 34% of total emissions and is the second largest source of emissions in the country, after LULUCF emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Policies that aim to mitigate these emissions include the policy for ‘promotion of investment for the generation of electricity from renewable energy’, which builds on the National Strategy on Climate Change and prioritises renewable energy generation as a matter of national interest and public necessity.

In 2019, renewables accounted for 24% of Peru’s total primary energy supply (TPES). Over 50% of this share came from biofuels and waste and just over 40% comes from hydro; wind and solar contribute only 4% to the overall share of renewables (IEA, 2019). Oil and gas made up 73% of the supply in the same year, and increase compared to a 64% share in 2010. In terms of electricity generation, in 2020, 58% of the country’s power came from hydro, a significant increase from a share of 49% in 2015. Solar and wind added up to a 5% contribution, compared to a 1% share in 2015. The other important source of electricity is natural gas with a share of 35% in 2020 (IEA, 2019).

The share of renewables in TPES and in electricity generation has been steadily increasing over the years in response to the four renewable energy auctions held since 2009 (El Comercio, 2017). In January 2022, the government announced it would offer two more auctions on solar and wind, totalling around 2000 MW capacity (Energia Estrategica, 2022).

The government continues to expand oil and gas exploration and extraction. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for oil extraction in Block 192 (Lote 192), Peru's most important oil asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves, producing approximately 10,500 barrels/day (Peru Energia, 2022a).

In March 2022, the vice-Ministry of Electricity signed an agreement to promote the development of green hydrogen in the country. Now the first green hydrogen project is planned for the southern coast of the country, with a pilot phase expected to produce up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day, requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity. According to the green hydrogen roadmap, the hydrogen industry has the potential to create up to 94,000 jobs in the country by 2050 (H2 Peru, 2022; Peru Energia, 2022b).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector emitted ~20 MtCO2e, which represent 19% of Peru’s total national emissions (excl. LULUCF) and 36% of the country’s energy-related emissions; it is the largest contributor to the sector’s emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; INGEI, 2021). Peru was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, especially in its first year when the government implemented a strict lockdown period which included the complete immobilisation of the population for weeks. The government now estimates that emissions from the transport sector in 2020 were ~0.6 MtCO2e lower due to the reduced circulation of vehicles during the lockdown (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020c).

To help mitigate the rapid increase in transport emissions, Peru has implemented a range of policies over the years, plus some additional developments in the context of the pandemic:

- In 2020, the government approved a decree that sets tax incentives to promote the acquisition of hybrid or electric vehicles by an accelerated depreciation of up to 50% per year (Decreto Legislativo Que Establece Un Régimen Especial de Depreciación y Modifica Plazos de Depreciación, 2020; PLATFORM for REDESIGN, 2020)
- In the same year, the government approved by law the National Programme for Sustainable Urban Transport, which supports the development of cycling infrastructure, referred to as low-emissions and low-risk mode of transport (Decreto Supremo Que Crea El Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano Sostenible, 2019).
- Full implementation of the second phase of the Lima Metro Network (Line 2) is expected to be completed by 2024 (Andina, 2020)
- COFIGAS Programme, which supports the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas, which estimates that about 274,000 vehicles were converted to gas since the start of the program until end of 2018 (COFIDE, 2019)
- An emissions standards Decree (updated in 2017) which establishes maximum permissible limits of atmospheric emissions for vehicles and mandates that as of 1 April 2018, vehicle emission standards will be Euro 4/IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 (Government of Peru, 2017; UNEP, 2017).

## Buildings

Cities across the country have been rapidly and disorderly growing over the last decade, paying little to no attention to climate-friendly construction guidelines. In the coastal region, which hosts almost 60% of the country’s population, winters have been getting colder and summers warmer over the past decade. The lack of sustainable infrastructure will only become more evident in the near future as the country continues to reach record temperatures every year (Gaillard, 2019).

In 2017, the government introduced energy efficiency labels for household appliances (Supreme Decree no. 009-2017-EM) and in 2015, a Sustainable Construction Code to improve technical criteria for the design and construction of public and private buildings was approved (Supreme Decree no. 015-2015-VIVIENDA).

The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years.

Although the government had been reporting lower annual deforestation rates since 2016, this remains a critical problem in Peru. This decreasing deforestation trend reported between 2016 and 2019 was attributed to the work done under the National Forest Conservation Program, which was extended for ten more years and has set the target of protecting 10 million forest hectares by 2030. According to the government, this would reduce current deforestation rates by 30% (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020e).

However, in 2020, Peru reached its highest deforestation rate in 20 years. According to the National Forest Programme, the country lost 203,000 hectares of forest in 2020; over 50,000 hectares more than the previous year (Sierra, 2021). The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, although migration back to rural areas as a result of the economic crisis linked to the pandemic also played a role.

At COP26, Peru signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use alongside over 145 other countries. The Declaration on Forests and Land Use aims to stop deforestation, as well as promote the conservation, protection and sustainable management of forests (UN Climate Change Conference 2021, 2021). While many celebrated the announcement, others seemed less optimistic of the potential impacts, while also highlighting the reluctance of some of the Declaration’s donors to take a harder line on the extractive and agricultural industries that have historically been the biggest threats to their societies (Mongabay, 2021).

Forests cover over two thirds of the national territory, Peru hosts about 740,000 square kilometres of forests, including the largest area of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil (World Bank, 2021). In Peru, land use and forestry is the main source of emissions, with a share of almost 53% reported for 2016 (INGEI, 2021). To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, the rate of deforestation worldwide needs to decline 70% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, compared to 2018 levels (State of climate action 2021).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2019 are taken from PRIMAPhist (Gütschow et al., 2021).

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied the following approach: For the energy and industry sectors, we assumed a directly proportional development of these sectors’ emissions with GDP growth rates from IMF for 2020–2021. For all other sectors, we assumed a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.

The LULUCF data points until 2016 were taken from the national inventory of emissions (INGEI, 2021).


## NDC and other targets

The pledge for 2030 is based on the latest NDC submission document from December 2020 (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). Peru’s submission covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The previous NDC covered only CO2, CH4 and N2O, for all sectors.

An absolute emissions level, including LULUCF, is provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional and conditional targets. To distinguish emissions reductions that are attributable to the LULUCF sector, the CAT assumes that the share of LULUCF mitigation efforts will be the same as it was in the first NDC submission, for both unconditional and conditional targets.

The assessment of Peru’s first NDC considers the mitigation split presented in the roadmap for NDC implementation (Government of Peru, 2018). According to the technical background document of the first NDC, for the unconditional target, 76% of the 20% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained from measures in the LULUCF sector. For the conditional target, 69% of the 30% emission reductions below BAU will be obtained in the LULUCF sector.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections for total energy-related CO2 emissions is based on the BAU scenario from the 7th edition of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2019). APEC’s BAU scenario assumes that electricity generation will grow by 69% until 2050 due to rapid economic growth, while electricity capacity will increase by 48%. Peru’s generation mix remains dominated by hydropower and gas-fired generation, with wind and solar power together accounting for 6.7% in 2050. This scenario assumes that Peru becomes a net natural gas importer around 2039 as demand rises rapidly and domestic natural gas production declines with the depletion of the Camisea field.

The APEC scenarios use historical energy and CO2 data derived from IEA Energy Balances of non-OECD countries and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The harmonisation of APEC energy-related CO2 with historical data from PRIMAP-hist results in about a 6 MtCO2e decrease in emissions projections for 2030.

Non-CO2 emissions were taken directly from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 and 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Other CO2 emissions were estimated based on their share in the last inventory with data until 2016 (INGEI, 2021) and their expected contribution under BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020a). Data was interpolated linearly in between years and harmonised with historical data.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target overview

In its NDC, Peru sets an unconditional target to not exceed an emissions level of 208.8 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). The CAT excluded emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target and converted it to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GWP values (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2030 target of up to 122.7 MtCO2e in 2030. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” compared to Peru’s fair share.

The NDC also includes a conditional target to limit emissions to 179.0 MtCO2e by 2030. Once again, the CAT excluded LULUCF emissions from the target and converted the SAR GWP values to AR4, resulting in a target of 107.7 MtCO2e by 2030. This represents a 15 MtCO2e reduction below the unconditional target (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to what is needed to happen domestically, will international support. Peru’s NDC states an intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but it is still in the process of developing its long-term strategy.


## NDC updates

On December 18, 2020 Peru submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC that represents progress beyond its previous submission but that is still incompatible with limiting global warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, let alone with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The regulation of the framework law on climate change (approved at the end of 2019), makes Peru’s Paris Agreement pledge legally binding (SINIA, 2020).

With its new target, Peru commits to limiting emissions to about 123 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, according to our calculations. This is an improvement compared to its first submission in two ways: it leads to 6% lower emissions level by 2030 and it has changed its format from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target.

Peru’s submission also includes a conditional 2030 target which, according to our calculations, limits emissions to about 107 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030, conditional to access to international climate finance (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). This represents a step forward compared to the first submission, leading to an 8% lower emissions level by 2030 and increasing the target format’s strength from a reduction below BAU to an absolute emissions reduction target. No further details have been provided for the conditional target (e.g., sectoral contributions to the target), making it difficult to assess.

The new NDC provides fewer details than the previous one in terms of the expected emissions reduction contribution of each sector and, more importantly, of the LULUCF sector (Gobierno del Peru, 2020). In general, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its climate targets as much as possible, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land.

Additionally, the new NDC states that Peru will update its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. The updated strategy, its objectives and main indicators are currently undergoing public consultation (as of August, 2022) and the final document is expected to be approved by the government by, at the latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a, 2022b).

According to our calculations, the new unconditional NDC target could be reached with the implementation of current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. This highlights a missed opportunity for Peru to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable but ambitious targets that are aligned with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

The increase in mitigation ambition of the new NDC is not enough to improve Peru’s rating. The CAT rates both Peru’s unconditional and conditional targets, as “Insufficient”.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Peru will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders.

Peru has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (unconditional), and one that requires international support (conditional). We rate the unconditional target against Peru’s fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share ’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Peru’s conditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s conditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

We rate Peru’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. This update will be based on a Technical Study commissioned to explore pathways to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. No further details have been communicated so far, but in January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N° 003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved by, latest, October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a). Before that, government officials announced that the mid-century carbon neutrality target would be based on four national priorities (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2020b):

- Transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable energy
- Electrification of the economy (less polluting transport, electromobility)
- Circular economy
- Nature-based solutions (sustainable use of natural resources).
This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Peru should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to achieve its carbon neutrality target, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance and eventual competition for land. **For the full analysis** **click here****.**
