# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.


# Governance


## Climate Governance Series

In March 2022, the CAT released its assessment of Egypt’s climate governance readiness. A summary of the report is below. The full report is available here.


## Egypt country profile

**President El-Sisi has not been a strong advocate of the need to transition the Egyptian society and economy towards net zero emissions.**. He has traditionally focused on the importance of climate adaptation and emphasised the need for climate finance from developed countries. More broadly, **expanding the country’s fossil gas production is a top priority for government officials, both for the country’s own energy security and as a valuable export commodity**, not starting on the path to decarbonisation.

While the climate change lead agency is entrusted with clear legal mandates, it needs greater power to reinforce its position as the lead institution on climate change issues in Egypt.

**There is incremental improvement in Egypt’s climate policy development, but the process is slow**. And, there have been some notable rollbacks, including measures adopted in response to the fuel shortages the country experienced a decade ago, and more recent measures that may dampen the speed of renewable energy uptake.

**The trustworthiness and the accountability of Egypt’s government is considered to be low** both generally and in relation to environmental governance metrics, which may inhibit the transition. Constitutional addendums passed in 2019 mean that the President could stay in power until 2030. The extent to which there is broadscale political support for the transition to a zero emissions society is somewhat moot against such a backdrop.

The National Council for Climate Change (NCCC) is an inter-ministerial committee and the key-decision body responsible for coordinating climate policy development and implementation across ministries and agencies. Assessing its effectiveness is difficult as information on the workings of the Council is limited. Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms.

**Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.** Egypt announced its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) in November 2021 and launched it in May 2022. Egypt’s numerous policies and strategy documents are generally aligned, though these are not transition focused and not updated frequently.

Egypt does not have an authoritative body with an explicit mandate to provide the government with transition-related advice, though some agencies may be capable of playing such a role. The government does consider external advice as part of its policy-development process.

**While the country has a high level of climate finance readiness in some areas, the financial and technical resources of the Ministry of Environment need to be improved.** Some specific technical capacities within the Ministry are lacking, such as GHG inventory preparation and funding proposals preparation, so it relies on external consultants. However, overall the Ministry is run by well-qualified staff who enable the lead agency, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), to build continuous institutional learning.

Egypt’s processes to develop, implement and track the policies needed to enable the transition are weak. **The country has not adopted a net zero target, nor has it set out a pathway to achieve it**.

The country’s existing legal architecture is comprised of piecemeal sectoral legislation which may help climate mitigation, but it lacks comprehensive, climate-focused legislation to support the transition. **A legislative review is underway to include climate change in all relevant laws, though no timeline for its completion has been given.** Implementation of existing regulations has also been problematic: enforcement of building sector energy use and efficient regulations are a case in point.

**Egypt does not have a comprehensive transparency framework.** A proposal was developed a few years ago, but it has not yet been adopted by the government. GHG inventories are an exception, with evidence of improvement at the national and sub-national level. **Egypt has not established a formal review mechanism for transition-related policies, nor is there evidence of any domestic ratchet-up mechanism.**

**Stakeholders are consulted as part of the decision-making process; however the scope and the depth of those consultations is difficult to gauge.** Consultations take place against a backdrop of low levels of public understanding of climate change - only about 40% of Egyptians consider that they know at least a moderate amount about climate change. Civil society is active in the climate space, but often faces capacity limitations, and recent legislative reforms have curtailed the ability of these groups to function.

**Egypt lacks a comprehensive strategy to ensure a Just Transition, but has had some success with the phasing out of its energy subsidies and the promotion of green jobs.** The full phase-out of consumption subsidies has been pushed back to mid 2025, due, in part, to concerns of rising consumer prices.

**The military is heavily involved in Egypt’s economy, especially in major public infrastructure projects**, which likely lessens the effect non-state actors can have on the government compared to other countries. This involvement is in activities that both support and potentially hinder the transition.

As the COP27 host in 2022, there was the potential for Egypt to improve on a number of governance metrics. However, the NDC submitted in July 2023 offered little improvements.

# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Egypt has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. In 2021, Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.


## Policy overview

Egypt’s main mitigation policies are set out in its second NDC update and its 2030 low emissions development strategy, which was adopted in early 2019 (Osama et al., 2019; Government of Egypt, 2023). In May 2022, Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, which does not include an overall emissions reduction goal.

In its second NDC update, Egypt strengthened its renewable energy target, pledging to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030. However, the government will need to significantly boost renewable energy deployment if it hopes to meet this revised target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

While Egypt is looking to ramp up renewable energy deployment, its primary focus remains the expansion of fossil gas production. The government recently unveiled plans to increase fossil gas exports, and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. This could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Egypt’s Vision 2030, developed in 2014–2015, is the country’s overarching sustainable development strategy. Climate change does not feature prominently, and the Vision does not include an economy-wide emission reduction target; however, it does have a few mitigation-related sectoral targets.

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane**: In June 2022, Egypt joined the Global Methane Pledge. Half of Egypt’s methane emissions come from the waste sector and a third from agriculture, the remainder are from energy (Gütschow et al., 2021). In its NDC, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions from gas flaring in the oil and gas sector to less than half of 2015 levels and lists some unquantified measures in the waste sector. However, it is unclear whether these measures are sufficient to reach the 2030 global goal of reducing methane emissions by 30%—especially given the planned increase in oil and gas production. The agriculture sector, a large source of methane emissions, is not covered in Egypt’s NDC.
- **Coal Exit**: Egypt is a signatory of the coal exit pledge. It does not have any coal plants currently. Its electricity generation is largely based on fossil gas, with coal being primarily used for industrial production (IEA, 2021a).
- **Beyond oil & gas**: Egypt is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Egypt plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.

## Energy supply

As part of its Vision 2030 sustainable development strategy, Egypt aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector by 10% by 2030. No baseline is given, but we assume it to be 2015, as that is around the time the strategy was developed.

Egypt’s economy is highly dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which represented nearly a quarter of GDP in 2019–2020 (U.S. ITA, 2021). The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021).

Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022). Egypt has:

- The third largest proven gas reserves in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria
- The second largest gas production, after Algeria
- The highest gas consumption, making up over a third of Africa’s total gas consumption
- The highest CO2 emissions from gas, making up nearly 40% of the continent’s total CO2 emissions linked to fossil gas.
Egypt’s fossil gas reserves are estimated at 1,780 bcm (63 Tcf) in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). In 2015, the Italian company ENI discovered the Mediterranean’s largest offshore gas field in Egypt’s waters (Government of Egypt, 2020a). The government estimates the reserves at around 850 bcm (30 Tcf)—although these are still unproven, and therefore not included in most official statistics at this stage.

In 2019, Egypt’s fossil gas production reached a high of 64 bcm, representing over a fourth of total gas production in Africa. Egypt has significantly ramped up its fossil gas production in the past few years, after a steep decline that followed the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

Despite this Egypt’s fossil gas exports remain much smaller compared to other major producers on the continent, due to steadily increasing domestic demand. However, the Egyptian government has clearly stated its intention to rapidly increase gas exports to cater to higher demand, in particular from Europe. Following Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, Egypt ramped up gas exports to European countries (S&P Global, 2023).

The Egyptian government hopes to position the country as a regional energy hub. In June 2022, the EU signed a deal with Egypt and Israel aimed at increasing the volumes of fossil gas exports to Europe. Israel is sending gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt, which is then re-exported to Europe as LNG from Egyptians ports (Reuters, 2023). To meet Europe’s fossil gas demand, Egypt plans to both pump more gas and receive more flows from Israel.

However, there are uncertainties about Egypt’s future LNG exports due to rising domestic demand and infrastructure constraints. The Egyptian government recently announced that it would only be able to significantly increase its gas exports from 2025 (Bloomberg, 2023).

Egypt’s fossil gas strategy could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Further, our 2022 analysis shows that a high share of renewables in the power sector (82% in 2035) could create an additional 1.8 million jobs compared to the government’s 2035 Energy Strategy — translating to nearly 130,000 additional jobs per year. A high share of renewable energy (82% by 2035) could also avoid more than 5,300 premature deaths linked to air pollution from fossil gas in the next two decades compared to the 2035 Energy Strategy, which foresees over 50% of electricity to be generated with gas in 2035.

Egypt’s oil production has been on a slow decline over the past two decades (IEA, 2019).

In 2018, Egypt joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring Initiative, which commits governments and oil companies to end gas flaring in oil production by 2030 (GGFR, 2022). In the last three years, Egypt has reduced gas flaring, thanks to investment in additional pipeline infrastructure (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023).

The majority of Egypt’s electricity is from fossil gas (IEA, 2019). Oil is a distant second, though together the two provide 90% of the country’s power. In absolute terms, the contribution from hydropower has changed little in the past three decades, but its overall share has fallen substantially as electricity demand has grown. In 2019, 7% of electricity was from hydropower, followed by wind (2%) and solar (1%).

It is difficult to assess Egypt’s electricity plans. Its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 has not been updated since 2016 and its five-year plans are hard to access.

The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 (ISES 2016), adopted by the Supreme Energy Council, Egypt’s top energy decision-making body, in October 2016, outlines the country’s vision for the energy sector. Eight scenarios were considered as part of the strategy development. The scenario ultimately adopted sets targets to generate 20% of electricity from renewable sources in 2022, increasing to 42% by 2035. With the recent NDC update, the renewable energy target was revised to 42% of renewable energy in Egypt’s electricity mix by 2030 (Government of Egypt, 2023).

The scenario adopted also includes nuclear and coal power. However, as discussed below, the nuclear plant has been delayed and the coal plants shelved.

IRENA estimates that Egypt could derive more than half (53%) of its electricity from renewables in 2030. This projection exceeds the government’s new renewable energy target, which aims to generate 42% of electricity from renewables by 2030 (IRENA, 2018).

Egypt has initiated some large-scale renewable energy projects, including the 1.6 GW Benban solar power plant. By the end of 2022, Egypt had installed around 1.6 GW of wind capacity and 1.7 GW of solar capacity—in addition to the existing 2.8 GW of hydropower (IRENA, 2023). However, the government will need to speed up renewable energy installation if it hopes to meet its new 2030 target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated, with installed capacity at 19% (World Bank, 2022).

In November 2021, the government imposed a 5% import tariff on solar panels, which had previously been duty free (Enterprise, 2021d).

Egypt is currently building its first nuclear power plant, though the project has suffered repeated delays (World Nuclear Association, 2023)Click or tap here to enter text.. The project is being developed in cooperation with, and largely financed by, Russia.

The site for the 4.8 GW plant, consisting of four 1.2 GW units, was approved in 2019, with construction originally scheduled for late 2020. However, the request for construction permits of the first two units was only made in mid-2021. After multiple delays, approval was finally granted at the end of 2022 (World Nuclear Association, 2023). The first reactor was originally supposed to come online in 2026, but has been delayed until 2028, with all units operational by 2030. The plant has a design life of 60+ years.

Egypt does not have any coal-fired power plants (Global Energy Monitor, 2023). The interest in coal power sprung out of the energy crisis in 2014 and the desire to reduce Egypt’s dependence on imported gas and was included in the 2030 Vision. However, the discovery of gas fields and their subsequent rapid development has changed the situation dramatically, as Egypt became a net exporter of gas in 2019.

In 2020, the government announced it had indefinitely postponed plans to construct the 6 GW Hamrawein coal-fired power plant, instead pursuing alternative renewable energy projects (Daily News Egypt, 2020). As a signatory of the Clean Power Transition Statement, Egypt has committed to not building any unabated coal-fired power generation in the future (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).

Egypt aims to become a hub for hydrogen production. At COP27, Egypt released an outline of its Low-carbon Hydrogen strategy, which set the objective to capture 5% of the global hydrogen market by 2040 (Reuters, 2022).

The Egyptian government has signed an MoU with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to develop the framework of Egypt’s hydrogen strategy. The EBRD will analyse global hydrogen market trends, Egypt's hydrogen production capabilities, and assess storage, conversion, and transportation methods. Several pilot projects are underway.

However, Egypt's definition of “low carbon” hydrogen remains ambiguous. To be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Egypt’s hydrogen strategy should exclusively focus on the production of green hydrogen (i.e., derived from renewable energy), and not hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

The government had originally planned to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies entirely by mid 2022, but has pushed the date back to mid 2025, in part over concerns of rising consumer prices (Enterprise, 2021c).


## Industry

Coal consumption in the industry sector increased substantially between 2016 and 2018, as the sector shifted away from fossil gas due to limited supply (IEA, 2021). Coal consumption somewhat decreased in 2019 but remains relatively high.

Emissions from Egypt’s cement sector have been on the rise due to increased production and a switch from gas to coal during the energy crisis in 2014 (EBRD, 2016).

In April 2015, Egypt passed legislation that allowed cement producers to switch from gas to coal in response to a nationwide energy crisis (EBRD, 2016). At the time, it was estimated that the switch would cause a 15% increase in CO2 emissions from the sector by 2030 (EBRD, 2016). A strategy was developed to counteract this increase with a suite of measures, full implementation of which could even have led to a reduction in emissions, not just a return to the pre-fuel switching baseline (EBRD, 2016). However, there is no information available on the progress of this policy.

The Egyptian, and the broader regional cement industry has also been plagued by oversupply for years (Vanderborght et al., 2016). While the strategy mentioned above noted that no new capacity was needed until 2025, a new state-owned facility was opened in 2018, further exacerbating the oversupply issue (EBRD, 2017; Enterprise, 2021b) . The drop in demand in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse.

Around 90% of the sector currently uses coal in at least part of their manufacturing process. Soaring coal prices in 2021 has some considering a switch back to gas, but its prices are also increasing (Enterprise, 2021a).

The Egyptian Waste Management Regulatory Authority is working on regulations that would require cement companies to use alternative fuels and waste materials in their production instead of coal, one of the recommended measures in the 2016 strategy (Enterprise, 2021a).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 30% of Egypt’s total energy consumption. Transport emissions have increased by 75% from 2005 to 2019 (World Bank, 2022). In its NDC, Egypt pledged to reduce emissions in the sector by 7% by 2030.

Fossil gas use in the transport sector is low but expected to increase. In 2020, the Egyptian government announced a nationwide programme to convert over 400,000 cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) by 2023, bringing the total number of cars running on gas to one million. The Central Bank of Egypt is supporting this initiative by providing loans with initial support amounting to nearly USD 1 billion (EIU, 2021). While CNG may be seen as a cleaner alternative to oil-fuelled cars, it is by no means a solution for air pollution. CNG-fuelled cars emit a significant amount of particle pollution—both ultrafine and PM2.5 (Transport & Environment, 2020).

The Egyptian EV market is in its infancy with only a few thousand cars on the road (The National, 2023). High prices, limited charging infrastructure and a challenging regulatory environment, both for the individual driver and the sector are all barriers to growth.

The government plans to subsidise the purchase of locally produced EVs and has set a goal of installing 3,000 charging stations by 2023 (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021). In April 2021, a committee was established by the Ministry for Public Enterprise to look into the location of the charging stations (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021a). Current numbers are difficult to come by; however, one of the leading installers has already built 70 stations with plans to expand to 300 by 2023 (Infinity, 2022).

The Ministry of Military Production, which has significant manufacturing capabilities, is developing an EV industry strategy that seeks to promote local production (New & Renewable Energy Authority, 2020). However, a concrete document has yet to be released. Egypt aims to be a key exporter of EVs by 2040. GM and Mercedes Benz are working with Egyptian partners to explore the possibility of local EV production (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021d). Negotiations between a Chinese automaker and Egyptian entities for local EV production faltered in late 2021, though some prototype testing did occur during the year. State-owned entities have also partner with local manufacturers to produce electric buses (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021b, 2021e).

Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain discussed developing the region’s first joint EV manufacturing deal during the Higher Committee of Integrated Partnership meeting held in Cairo in March 2023. The four countries signed several industrial partnerships, including an agreement to build three EV factories across Egypt, Jordan and the UAE (Zawya, 2023).

Importing used cars is banned in Egypt; however, the ban was relaxed in 2018 to allow for the importation of used EVs that are not more than three years old (Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2021).


## Waste

In October 2020, Egypt adopted a new waste management law (Enterprise, 2020a). Effective waste management has been a challenge for the country for the last decade. In September 2021, a public-private partnership was formed to build the first waste-to-energy plant (Green Tech Egypt, 2021b, 2021a). A waste-to-energy feed in tariff to support such projects was adopted in 2019; however, as electricity is currently in oversupply, this measure may do little to support the industry in practice (Enterprise, 2020c; Riad & Riad, 2020).


# Sources


# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC

Egypt’s updated NDC target is expressed as a reduction below a BAU scenario. Egypt’s NDC only provides BAU values for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors. For energy-related CO2 emissions not covered by electricity and transport, we have used a reference scenario from IRENA’s Renewable Energy Outlook report to estimate the BAU values (IRENA, 2018). For other sectors and gases (including the “associated gases” oil & gas sub-sector), we have used a ten-year trend (2006–2015) up to the 2015 baseline year specified in the NDC. As Egypt’s NDC only covers emissions from CO2, CH4 and N20, we have used our current policy projections values for F-gases (instead of estimating a business-as-usual scenario).

We have used the reductions in Egypt’s NDC for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sectors. These reductions represent the upper end of the conditional NDC quantification. For the lower end of the range, we also estimated emissions reductions from the industry and buildings sectors.

Egypt’s NDC refers to the Low-Carbon Roadmap for Egypt’s Cement Sector, which targets a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions from the cement sector (Vanderborght et al., 2016). As cement represents a large share of Egypt’s CO2 emissions in the industry sector, we have assumed this reduction applies to the entire sector and subtracted it from our industry BAU (IRENA’s reference scenario for industry) (IRENA, 2018). For the buildings sector, we have assumed an 8% reduction below IRENA’s reference scenario, in line with the reduction in non-renewable energy use between 2015 and 2030 in IRENA’s enhanced renewable energy (REmap) scenario compared to the reference one in 2030.

Egypt’s NDC uses the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. The CAT expresses emissions in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWPs. For the transport and electricity sectors, we have used the original values from Egypt’s NDC, as most of the emissions in those sectors are from CO2. In 2015, 98% of transport emissions and nearly 100% of emissions from energy industries were from CO2 according to Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report. For the oil & gas sub-sector, we have assumed all emissions are methane, and have converted values from SAR to AR4 GWP.


## Current policy projections

We derive the range of projections under current policies according to the following method:

Lower end of the range: Historical data shows that per capita emissions have been largely stable in the past. We assume that this correlation remains and apply the average per capita emissions to UN population prospects until 2030.

Upper end of the range: We use projections from the IRENA RE Outlook for Egypt for energy related CO2 emissions. For all other emissions, we assume a continued trend of past emissions up to 2030.

We further investigate the impact of the RE targets on emissions. Meeting the target does not decrease emissions of the upper end of the range beyond the lower end. Even when assuming a lower electricity generation growth than in the IRENA reference scenario, the emissions reductions compared to the reference do not lead to lower emissions. We thus assume that the target is covered by our range.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target overview

Egypt submitted its second, updated NDC to the UNFCCC on 26 June 2023, strengthening only its emissions reduction target in the power sector.

Egypt’s NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions reduction target but rather presents emissions reductions to be achieved in the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors (Government of Egypt, 2023). Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC. The lack of transparency in the NDC makes any assessment of the targets difficult.

The NDC is conditional on Egypt receiving international support. Egypt does not specify whether any portion of the NDC is unconditional.

We estimate Egypt can easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it has already put in place, and it should therefore submit a strengthened target that incentivises additional emission reductions.

Egypt does not have a net-zero emissions target, nor has it submitted a Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC as of July 2023.

* See Assumptions section for a discussion on GWP values.


## NDC updates

Egypt submitted its second updated NDC on 26 June 2023 (Government of Egypt, 2023). This update is exactly the same as the previous, 2022, submission, with the exception of the revised renewable energy target.

Egypt has now committed to achieving 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030, five years earlier than under the previous NDC. Consequently, Egypt strengthened its emissions reduction target in the power sector by 10 MtCO2e or 14% compared to the previous target. However, since this revised target is the only modification, the overall impact of this NDC update remains minor.

The new NDC target is conditional on international support and Egypt still does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. The CAT estimates Egypt can easily achieve this target – even without international support – and should therefore substantially strengthen it.

The new NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions target but instead includes emissions reductions to be achieved in the following sub-sectors: electricity, transport and oil & gas.

By 2030, Egypt pledges to the following emissions levels in these sectors:

- Electricity: 134* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 215* MtCO2e)
- Transport: 115* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 124* MtCO2e)
- Oil & gas production (associated gases sub-sector): 1.1 MtCO2e1 (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 3.1 MtCO2e2)
*NOTE: The figures used in Egypt’s NDC use global warming potential values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We have not converted the values from electricity and transport to AR4 values as CO2 is the dominant gas (see the Assumptions section for further details).

These three sectors accounted for 43% of Egypt’s total GHG emissions3 in 2015, the baseline year. In total, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions by 92 MtCO2e compared to a business-as-usual pathway in these sectors.

The revised target for the electricity sector is more ambitious than the previous one, as Egypt aims to reach it five years earlier and clarifies that it pertains to the share of electricity generation rather than capacity.

Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC.

We estimate the conditional NDC target would lead to emissions increasing from around 345 MtCO2 today to 496–512 MtCO2e in 2030. The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030.

Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC. We have estimated a BAU scenario using the values provided for electricity, transport and oil & gas and estimating emissions for the remaining sectors using historical trends. The upper end of our target range is based on the quantified reductions for the three sub-sectors only. For the lower end, we also estimated some of the emissions reductions for the policies and measures proposed for the industry and buildings sector. For more details on our calculations, please refer to the assumptions section.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.

Egypt only has a conditional target. We rate the conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). Egypt does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. In the absence of a target, we use our estimate for Egypt’s business-as-usual target as its unconditional target.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates Egypt’s conditional target “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s conditional NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

BAU Scenario against fair share

In the absence of an unconditional NDC emissions reduction target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated ‘business as usual’ scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient**”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s (estimated) target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).


# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.


# Governance


## Climate Governance Series

In March 2022, the CAT released its assessment of Egypt’s climate governance readiness. A summary of the report is below. The full report is available here.


## Egypt country profile

**President El-Sisi has not been a strong advocate of the need to transition the Egyptian society and economy towards net zero emissions.**. He has traditionally focused on the importance of climate adaptation and emphasised the need for climate finance from developed countries. More broadly, **expanding the country’s fossil gas production is a top priority for government officials, both for the country’s own energy security and as a valuable export commodity**, not starting on the path to decarbonisation.

While the climate change lead agency is entrusted with clear legal mandates, it needs greater power to reinforce its position as the lead institution on climate change issues in Egypt.

**There is incremental improvement in Egypt’s climate policy development, but the process is slow**. And, there have been some notable rollbacks, including measures adopted in response to the fuel shortages the country experienced a decade ago, and more recent measures that may dampen the speed of renewable energy uptake.

**The trustworthiness and the accountability of Egypt’s government is considered to be low** both generally and in relation to environmental governance metrics, which may inhibit the transition. Constitutional addendums passed in 2019 mean that the President could stay in power until 2030. The extent to which there is broadscale political support for the transition to a zero emissions society is somewhat moot against such a backdrop.

The National Council for Climate Change (NCCC) is an inter-ministerial committee and the key-decision body responsible for coordinating climate policy development and implementation across ministries and agencies. Assessing its effectiveness is difficult as information on the workings of the Council is limited. Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms.

**Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.** Egypt announced its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) in November 2021 and launched it in May 2022. Egypt’s numerous policies and strategy documents are generally aligned, though these are not transition focused and not updated frequently.

Egypt does not have an authoritative body with an explicit mandate to provide the government with transition-related advice, though some agencies may be capable of playing such a role. The government does consider external advice as part of its policy-development process.

**While the country has a high level of climate finance readiness in some areas, the financial and technical resources of the Ministry of Environment need to be improved.** Some specific technical capacities within the Ministry are lacking, such as GHG inventory preparation and funding proposals preparation, so it relies on external consultants. However, overall the Ministry is run by well-qualified staff who enable the lead agency, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), to build continuous institutional learning.

Egypt’s processes to develop, implement and track the policies needed to enable the transition are weak. **The country has not adopted a net zero target, nor has it set out a pathway to achieve it**.

The country’s existing legal architecture is comprised of piecemeal sectoral legislation which may help climate mitigation, but it lacks comprehensive, climate-focused legislation to support the transition. **A legislative review is underway to include climate change in all relevant laws, though no timeline for its completion has been given.** Implementation of existing regulations has also been problematic: enforcement of building sector energy use and efficient regulations are a case in point.

**Egypt does not have a comprehensive transparency framework.** A proposal was developed a few years ago, but it has not yet been adopted by the government. GHG inventories are an exception, with evidence of improvement at the national and sub-national level. **Egypt has not established a formal review mechanism for transition-related policies, nor is there evidence of any domestic ratchet-up mechanism.**

**Stakeholders are consulted as part of the decision-making process; however the scope and the depth of those consultations is difficult to gauge.** Consultations take place against a backdrop of low levels of public understanding of climate change - only about 40% of Egyptians consider that they know at least a moderate amount about climate change. Civil society is active in the climate space, but often faces capacity limitations, and recent legislative reforms have curtailed the ability of these groups to function.

**Egypt lacks a comprehensive strategy to ensure a Just Transition, but has had some success with the phasing out of its energy subsidies and the promotion of green jobs.** The full phase-out of consumption subsidies has been pushed back to mid 2025, due, in part, to concerns of rising consumer prices.

**The military is heavily involved in Egypt’s economy, especially in major public infrastructure projects**, which likely lessens the effect non-state actors can have on the government compared to other countries. This involvement is in activities that both support and potentially hinder the transition.

As the COP27 host in 2022, there was the potential for Egypt to improve on a number of governance metrics. However, the NDC submitted in July 2023 offered little improvements.

# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Egypt has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. In 2021, Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.


## Policy overview

Egypt’s main mitigation policies are set out in its second NDC update and its 2030 low emissions development strategy, which was adopted in early 2019 (Osama et al., 2019; Government of Egypt, 2023). In May 2022, Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, which does not include an overall emissions reduction goal.

In its second NDC update, Egypt strengthened its renewable energy target, pledging to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030. However, the government will need to significantly boost renewable energy deployment if it hopes to meet this revised target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

While Egypt is looking to ramp up renewable energy deployment, its primary focus remains the expansion of fossil gas production. The government recently unveiled plans to increase fossil gas exports, and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. This could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Egypt’s Vision 2030, developed in 2014–2015, is the country’s overarching sustainable development strategy. Climate change does not feature prominently, and the Vision does not include an economy-wide emission reduction target; however, it does have a few mitigation-related sectoral targets.

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane**: In June 2022, Egypt joined the Global Methane Pledge. Half of Egypt’s methane emissions come from the waste sector and a third from agriculture, the remainder are from energy (Gütschow et al., 2021). In its NDC, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions from gas flaring in the oil and gas sector to less than half of 2015 levels and lists some unquantified measures in the waste sector. However, it is unclear whether these measures are sufficient to reach the 2030 global goal of reducing methane emissions by 30%—especially given the planned increase in oil and gas production. The agriculture sector, a large source of methane emissions, is not covered in Egypt’s NDC.
- **Coal Exit**: Egypt is a signatory of the coal exit pledge. It does not have any coal plants currently. Its electricity generation is largely based on fossil gas, with coal being primarily used for industrial production (IEA, 2021a).
- **Beyond oil & gas**: Egypt is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Egypt plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.

## Energy supply

As part of its Vision 2030 sustainable development strategy, Egypt aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector by 10% by 2030. No baseline is given, but we assume it to be 2015, as that is around the time the strategy was developed.

Egypt’s economy is highly dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which represented nearly a quarter of GDP in 2019–2020 (U.S. ITA, 2021). The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021).

Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022). Egypt has:

- The third largest proven gas reserves in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria
- The second largest gas production, after Algeria
- The highest gas consumption, making up over a third of Africa’s total gas consumption
- The highest CO2 emissions from gas, making up nearly 40% of the continent’s total CO2 emissions linked to fossil gas.
Egypt’s fossil gas reserves are estimated at 1,780 bcm (63 Tcf) in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). In 2015, the Italian company ENI discovered the Mediterranean’s largest offshore gas field in Egypt’s waters (Government of Egypt, 2020a). The government estimates the reserves at around 850 bcm (30 Tcf)—although these are still unproven, and therefore not included in most official statistics at this stage.

In 2019, Egypt’s fossil gas production reached a high of 64 bcm, representing over a fourth of total gas production in Africa. Egypt has significantly ramped up its fossil gas production in the past few years, after a steep decline that followed the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

Despite this Egypt’s fossil gas exports remain much smaller compared to other major producers on the continent, due to steadily increasing domestic demand. However, the Egyptian government has clearly stated its intention to rapidly increase gas exports to cater to higher demand, in particular from Europe. Following Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, Egypt ramped up gas exports to European countries (S&P Global, 2023).

The Egyptian government hopes to position the country as a regional energy hub. In June 2022, the EU signed a deal with Egypt and Israel aimed at increasing the volumes of fossil gas exports to Europe. Israel is sending gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt, which is then re-exported to Europe as LNG from Egyptians ports (Reuters, 2023). To meet Europe’s fossil gas demand, Egypt plans to both pump more gas and receive more flows from Israel.

However, there are uncertainties about Egypt’s future LNG exports due to rising domestic demand and infrastructure constraints. The Egyptian government recently announced that it would only be able to significantly increase its gas exports from 2025 (Bloomberg, 2023).

Egypt’s fossil gas strategy could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Further, our 2022 analysis shows that a high share of renewables in the power sector (82% in 2035) could create an additional 1.8 million jobs compared to the government’s 2035 Energy Strategy — translating to nearly 130,000 additional jobs per year. A high share of renewable energy (82% by 2035) could also avoid more than 5,300 premature deaths linked to air pollution from fossil gas in the next two decades compared to the 2035 Energy Strategy, which foresees over 50% of electricity to be generated with gas in 2035.

Egypt’s oil production has been on a slow decline over the past two decades (IEA, 2019).

In 2018, Egypt joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring Initiative, which commits governments and oil companies to end gas flaring in oil production by 2030 (GGFR, 2022). In the last three years, Egypt has reduced gas flaring, thanks to investment in additional pipeline infrastructure (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023).

The majority of Egypt’s electricity is from fossil gas (IEA, 2019). Oil is a distant second, though together the two provide 90% of the country’s power. In absolute terms, the contribution from hydropower has changed little in the past three decades, but its overall share has fallen substantially as electricity demand has grown. In 2019, 7% of electricity was from hydropower, followed by wind (2%) and solar (1%).

It is difficult to assess Egypt’s electricity plans. Its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 has not been updated since 2016 and its five-year plans are hard to access.

The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 (ISES 2016), adopted by the Supreme Energy Council, Egypt’s top energy decision-making body, in October 2016, outlines the country’s vision for the energy sector. Eight scenarios were considered as part of the strategy development. The scenario ultimately adopted sets targets to generate 20% of electricity from renewable sources in 2022, increasing to 42% by 2035. With the recent NDC update, the renewable energy target was revised to 42% of renewable energy in Egypt’s electricity mix by 2030 (Government of Egypt, 2023).

The scenario adopted also includes nuclear and coal power. However, as discussed below, the nuclear plant has been delayed and the coal plants shelved.

IRENA estimates that Egypt could derive more than half (53%) of its electricity from renewables in 2030. This projection exceeds the government’s new renewable energy target, which aims to generate 42% of electricity from renewables by 2030 (IRENA, 2018).

Egypt has initiated some large-scale renewable energy projects, including the 1.6 GW Benban solar power plant. By the end of 2022, Egypt had installed around 1.6 GW of wind capacity and 1.7 GW of solar capacity—in addition to the existing 2.8 GW of hydropower (IRENA, 2023). However, the government will need to speed up renewable energy installation if it hopes to meet its new 2030 target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated, with installed capacity at 19% (World Bank, 2022).

In November 2021, the government imposed a 5% import tariff on solar panels, which had previously been duty free (Enterprise, 2021d).

Egypt is currently building its first nuclear power plant, though the project has suffered repeated delays (World Nuclear Association, 2023)Click or tap here to enter text.. The project is being developed in cooperation with, and largely financed by, Russia.

The site for the 4.8 GW plant, consisting of four 1.2 GW units, was approved in 2019, with construction originally scheduled for late 2020. However, the request for construction permits of the first two units was only made in mid-2021. After multiple delays, approval was finally granted at the end of 2022 (World Nuclear Association, 2023). The first reactor was originally supposed to come online in 2026, but has been delayed until 2028, with all units operational by 2030. The plant has a design life of 60+ years.

Egypt does not have any coal-fired power plants (Global Energy Monitor, 2023). The interest in coal power sprung out of the energy crisis in 2014 and the desire to reduce Egypt’s dependence on imported gas and was included in the 2030 Vision. However, the discovery of gas fields and their subsequent rapid development has changed the situation dramatically, as Egypt became a net exporter of gas in 2019.

In 2020, the government announced it had indefinitely postponed plans to construct the 6 GW Hamrawein coal-fired power plant, instead pursuing alternative renewable energy projects (Daily News Egypt, 2020). As a signatory of the Clean Power Transition Statement, Egypt has committed to not building any unabated coal-fired power generation in the future (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).

Egypt aims to become a hub for hydrogen production. At COP27, Egypt released an outline of its Low-carbon Hydrogen strategy, which set the objective to capture 5% of the global hydrogen market by 2040 (Reuters, 2022).

The Egyptian government has signed an MoU with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to develop the framework of Egypt’s hydrogen strategy. The EBRD will analyse global hydrogen market trends, Egypt's hydrogen production capabilities, and assess storage, conversion, and transportation methods. Several pilot projects are underway.

However, Egypt's definition of “low carbon” hydrogen remains ambiguous. To be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Egypt’s hydrogen strategy should exclusively focus on the production of green hydrogen (i.e., derived from renewable energy), and not hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

The government had originally planned to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies entirely by mid 2022, but has pushed the date back to mid 2025, in part over concerns of rising consumer prices (Enterprise, 2021c).


## Industry

Coal consumption in the industry sector increased substantially between 2016 and 2018, as the sector shifted away from fossil gas due to limited supply (IEA, 2021). Coal consumption somewhat decreased in 2019 but remains relatively high.

Emissions from Egypt’s cement sector have been on the rise due to increased production and a switch from gas to coal during the energy crisis in 2014 (EBRD, 2016).

In April 2015, Egypt passed legislation that allowed cement producers to switch from gas to coal in response to a nationwide energy crisis (EBRD, 2016). At the time, it was estimated that the switch would cause a 15% increase in CO2 emissions from the sector by 2030 (EBRD, 2016). A strategy was developed to counteract this increase with a suite of measures, full implementation of which could even have led to a reduction in emissions, not just a return to the pre-fuel switching baseline (EBRD, 2016). However, there is no information available on the progress of this policy.

The Egyptian, and the broader regional cement industry has also been plagued by oversupply for years (Vanderborght et al., 2016). While the strategy mentioned above noted that no new capacity was needed until 2025, a new state-owned facility was opened in 2018, further exacerbating the oversupply issue (EBRD, 2017; Enterprise, 2021b) . The drop in demand in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse.

Around 90% of the sector currently uses coal in at least part of their manufacturing process. Soaring coal prices in 2021 has some considering a switch back to gas, but its prices are also increasing (Enterprise, 2021a).

The Egyptian Waste Management Regulatory Authority is working on regulations that would require cement companies to use alternative fuels and waste materials in their production instead of coal, one of the recommended measures in the 2016 strategy (Enterprise, 2021a).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 30% of Egypt’s total energy consumption. Transport emissions have increased by 75% from 2005 to 2019 (World Bank, 2022). In its NDC, Egypt pledged to reduce emissions in the sector by 7% by 2030.

Fossil gas use in the transport sector is low but expected to increase. In 2020, the Egyptian government announced a nationwide programme to convert over 400,000 cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) by 2023, bringing the total number of cars running on gas to one million. The Central Bank of Egypt is supporting this initiative by providing loans with initial support amounting to nearly USD 1 billion (EIU, 2021). While CNG may be seen as a cleaner alternative to oil-fuelled cars, it is by no means a solution for air pollution. CNG-fuelled cars emit a significant amount of particle pollution—both ultrafine and PM2.5 (Transport & Environment, 2020).

The Egyptian EV market is in its infancy with only a few thousand cars on the road (The National, 2023). High prices, limited charging infrastructure and a challenging regulatory environment, both for the individual driver and the sector are all barriers to growth.

The government plans to subsidise the purchase of locally produced EVs and has set a goal of installing 3,000 charging stations by 2023 (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021). In April 2021, a committee was established by the Ministry for Public Enterprise to look into the location of the charging stations (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021a). Current numbers are difficult to come by; however, one of the leading installers has already built 70 stations with plans to expand to 300 by 2023 (Infinity, 2022).

The Ministry of Military Production, which has significant manufacturing capabilities, is developing an EV industry strategy that seeks to promote local production (New & Renewable Energy Authority, 2020). However, a concrete document has yet to be released. Egypt aims to be a key exporter of EVs by 2040. GM and Mercedes Benz are working with Egyptian partners to explore the possibility of local EV production (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021d). Negotiations between a Chinese automaker and Egyptian entities for local EV production faltered in late 2021, though some prototype testing did occur during the year. State-owned entities have also partner with local manufacturers to produce electric buses (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021b, 2021e).

Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain discussed developing the region’s first joint EV manufacturing deal during the Higher Committee of Integrated Partnership meeting held in Cairo in March 2023. The four countries signed several industrial partnerships, including an agreement to build three EV factories across Egypt, Jordan and the UAE (Zawya, 2023).

Importing used cars is banned in Egypt; however, the ban was relaxed in 2018 to allow for the importation of used EVs that are not more than three years old (Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2021).


## Waste

In October 2020, Egypt adopted a new waste management law (Enterprise, 2020a). Effective waste management has been a challenge for the country for the last decade. In September 2021, a public-private partnership was formed to build the first waste-to-energy plant (Green Tech Egypt, 2021b, 2021a). A waste-to-energy feed in tariff to support such projects was adopted in 2019; however, as electricity is currently in oversupply, this measure may do little to support the industry in practice (Enterprise, 2020c; Riad & Riad, 2020).


# Sources


# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC

Egypt’s updated NDC target is expressed as a reduction below a BAU scenario. Egypt’s NDC only provides BAU values for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors. For energy-related CO2 emissions not covered by electricity and transport, we have used a reference scenario from IRENA’s Renewable Energy Outlook report to estimate the BAU values (IRENA, 2018). For other sectors and gases (including the “associated gases” oil & gas sub-sector), we have used a ten-year trend (2006–2015) up to the 2015 baseline year specified in the NDC. As Egypt’s NDC only covers emissions from CO2, CH4 and N20, we have used our current policy projections values for F-gases (instead of estimating a business-as-usual scenario).

We have used the reductions in Egypt’s NDC for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sectors. These reductions represent the upper end of the conditional NDC quantification. For the lower end of the range, we also estimated emissions reductions from the industry and buildings sectors.

Egypt’s NDC refers to the Low-Carbon Roadmap for Egypt’s Cement Sector, which targets a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions from the cement sector (Vanderborght et al., 2016). As cement represents a large share of Egypt’s CO2 emissions in the industry sector, we have assumed this reduction applies to the entire sector and subtracted it from our industry BAU (IRENA’s reference scenario for industry) (IRENA, 2018). For the buildings sector, we have assumed an 8% reduction below IRENA’s reference scenario, in line with the reduction in non-renewable energy use between 2015 and 2030 in IRENA’s enhanced renewable energy (REmap) scenario compared to the reference one in 2030.

Egypt’s NDC uses the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. The CAT expresses emissions in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWPs. For the transport and electricity sectors, we have used the original values from Egypt’s NDC, as most of the emissions in those sectors are from CO2. In 2015, 98% of transport emissions and nearly 100% of emissions from energy industries were from CO2 according to Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report. For the oil & gas sub-sector, we have assumed all emissions are methane, and have converted values from SAR to AR4 GWP.


## Current policy projections

We derive the range of projections under current policies according to the following method:

Lower end of the range: Historical data shows that per capita emissions have been largely stable in the past. We assume that this correlation remains and apply the average per capita emissions to UN population prospects until 2030.

Upper end of the range: We use projections from the IRENA RE Outlook for Egypt for energy related CO2 emissions. For all other emissions, we assume a continued trend of past emissions up to 2030.

We further investigate the impact of the RE targets on emissions. Meeting the target does not decrease emissions of the upper end of the range beyond the lower end. Even when assuming a lower electricity generation growth than in the IRENA reference scenario, the emissions reductions compared to the reference do not lead to lower emissions. We thus assume that the target is covered by our range.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target overview

Egypt submitted its second, updated NDC to the UNFCCC on 26 June 2023, strengthening only its emissions reduction target in the power sector.

Egypt’s NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions reduction target but rather presents emissions reductions to be achieved in the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors (Government of Egypt, 2023). Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC. The lack of transparency in the NDC makes any assessment of the targets difficult.

The NDC is conditional on Egypt receiving international support. Egypt does not specify whether any portion of the NDC is unconditional.

We estimate Egypt can easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it has already put in place, and it should therefore submit a strengthened target that incentivises additional emission reductions.

Egypt does not have a net-zero emissions target, nor has it submitted a Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC as of July 2023.

* See Assumptions section for a discussion on GWP values.


## NDC updates

Egypt submitted its second updated NDC on 26 June 2023 (Government of Egypt, 2023). This update is exactly the same as the previous, 2022, submission, with the exception of the revised renewable energy target.

Egypt has now committed to achieving 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030, five years earlier than under the previous NDC. Consequently, Egypt strengthened its emissions reduction target in the power sector by 10 MtCO2e or 14% compared to the previous target. However, since this revised target is the only modification, the overall impact of this NDC update remains minor.

The new NDC target is conditional on international support and Egypt still does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. The CAT estimates Egypt can easily achieve this target – even without international support – and should therefore substantially strengthen it.

The new NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions target but instead includes emissions reductions to be achieved in the following sub-sectors: electricity, transport and oil & gas.

By 2030, Egypt pledges to the following emissions levels in these sectors:

- Electricity: 134* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 215* MtCO2e)
- Transport: 115* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 124* MtCO2e)
- Oil & gas production (associated gases sub-sector): 1.1 MtCO2e1 (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 3.1 MtCO2e2)
*NOTE: The figures used in Egypt’s NDC use global warming potential values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We have not converted the values from electricity and transport to AR4 values as CO2 is the dominant gas (see the Assumptions section for further details).

These three sectors accounted for 43% of Egypt’s total GHG emissions3 in 2015, the baseline year. In total, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions by 92 MtCO2e compared to a business-as-usual pathway in these sectors.

The revised target for the electricity sector is more ambitious than the previous one, as Egypt aims to reach it five years earlier and clarifies that it pertains to the share of electricity generation rather than capacity.

Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC.

We estimate the conditional NDC target would lead to emissions increasing from around 345 MtCO2 today to 496–512 MtCO2e in 2030. The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030.

Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC. We have estimated a BAU scenario using the values provided for electricity, transport and oil & gas and estimating emissions for the remaining sectors using historical trends. The upper end of our target range is based on the quantified reductions for the three sub-sectors only. For the lower end, we also estimated some of the emissions reductions for the policies and measures proposed for the industry and buildings sector. For more details on our calculations, please refer to the assumptions section.

See Assumptions section for further details on conversion.3Expressed in AR4 Global Warming Potential. Egypt’s NDC, expressed in SAR GWP, states these sectors accounted for 43% of total emissions in 2015.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.

Egypt only has a conditional target. We rate the conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). Egypt does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. In the absence of a target, we use our estimate for Egypt’s business-as-usual target as its unconditional target.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates Egypt’s conditional target “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s conditional NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

BAU Scenario against fair share

In the absence of an unconditional NDC emissions reduction target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated ‘business as usual’ scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient**”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s (estimated) target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).


# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.


# Governance


## Climate Governance Series

In March 2022, the CAT released its assessment of Egypt’s climate governance readiness. A summary of the report is below. The full report is available here.


## Egypt country profile

**President El-Sisi has not been a strong advocate of the need to transition the Egyptian society and economy towards net zero emissions.**. He has traditionally focused on the importance of climate adaptation and emphasised the need for climate finance from developed countries. More broadly, **expanding the country’s fossil gas production is a top priority for government officials, both for the country’s own energy security and as a valuable export commodity**, not starting on the path to decarbonisation.

While the climate change lead agency is entrusted with clear legal mandates, it needs greater power to reinforce its position as the lead institution on climate change issues in Egypt.

**There is incremental improvement in Egypt’s climate policy development, but the process is slow**. And, there have been some notable rollbacks, including measures adopted in response to the fuel shortages the country experienced a decade ago, and more recent measures that may dampen the speed of renewable energy uptake.

**The trustworthiness and the accountability of Egypt’s government is considered to be low** both generally and in relation to environmental governance metrics, which may inhibit the transition. Constitutional addendums passed in 2019 mean that the President could stay in power until 2030. The extent to which there is broadscale political support for the transition to a zero emissions society is somewhat moot against such a backdrop.

The National Council for Climate Change (NCCC) is an inter-ministerial committee and the key-decision body responsible for coordinating climate policy development and implementation across ministries and agencies. Assessing its effectiveness is difficult as information on the workings of the Council is limited. Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms.

**Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.** Egypt announced its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) in November 2021 and launched it in May 2022. Egypt’s numerous policies and strategy documents are generally aligned, though these are not transition focused and not updated frequently.

Egypt does not have an authoritative body with an explicit mandate to provide the government with transition-related advice, though some agencies may be capable of playing such a role. The government does consider external advice as part of its policy-development process.

**While the country has a high level of climate finance readiness in some areas, the financial and technical resources of the Ministry of Environment need to be improved.** Some specific technical capacities within the Ministry are lacking, such as GHG inventory preparation and funding proposals preparation, so it relies on external consultants. However, overall the Ministry is run by well-qualified staff who enable the lead agency, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), to build continuous institutional learning.

Egypt’s processes to develop, implement and track the policies needed to enable the transition are weak. **The country has not adopted a net zero target, nor has it set out a pathway to achieve it**.

The country’s existing legal architecture is comprised of piecemeal sectoral legislation which may help climate mitigation, but it lacks comprehensive, climate-focused legislation to support the transition. **A legislative review is underway to include climate change in all relevant laws, though no timeline for its completion has been given.** Implementation of existing regulations has also been problematic: enforcement of building sector energy use and efficient regulations are a case in point.

**Egypt does not have a comprehensive transparency framework.** A proposal was developed a few years ago, but it has not yet been adopted by the government. GHG inventories are an exception, with evidence of improvement at the national and sub-national level. **Egypt has not established a formal review mechanism for transition-related policies, nor is there evidence of any domestic ratchet-up mechanism.**

**Stakeholders are consulted as part of the decision-making process; however the scope and the depth of those consultations is difficult to gauge.** Consultations take place against a backdrop of low levels of public understanding of climate change - only about 40% of Egyptians consider that they know at least a moderate amount about climate change. Civil society is active in the climate space, but often faces capacity limitations, and recent legislative reforms have curtailed the ability of these groups to function.

**Egypt lacks a comprehensive strategy to ensure a Just Transition, but has had some success with the phasing out of its energy subsidies and the promotion of green jobs.** The full phase-out of consumption subsidies has been pushed back to mid 2025, due, in part, to concerns of rising consumer prices.

**The military is heavily involved in Egypt’s economy, especially in major public infrastructure projects**, which likely lessens the effect non-state actors can have on the government compared to other countries. This involvement is in activities that both support and potentially hinder the transition.

As the COP27 host in 2022, there was the potential for Egypt to improve on a number of governance metrics. However, the NDC submitted in July 2023 offered little improvements.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Egypt has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. In 2021, Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.


## Policy overview

Egypt’s main mitigation policies are set out in its second NDC update and its 2030 low emissions development strategy, which was adopted in early 2019 (Osama et al., 2019; Government of Egypt, 2023). In May 2022, Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, which does not include an overall emissions reduction goal.

In its second NDC update, Egypt strengthened its renewable energy target, pledging to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030. However, the government will need to significantly boost renewable energy deployment if it hopes to meet this revised target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

While Egypt is looking to ramp up renewable energy deployment, its primary focus remains the expansion of fossil gas production. The government recently unveiled plans to increase fossil gas exports, and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. This could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Egypt’s Vision 2030, developed in 2014–2015, is the country’s overarching sustainable development strategy. Climate change does not feature prominently, and the Vision does not include an economy-wide emission reduction target; however, it does have a few mitigation-related sectoral targets.

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane**: In June 2022, Egypt joined the Global Methane Pledge. Half of Egypt’s methane emissions come from the waste sector and a third from agriculture, the remainder are from energy (Gütschow et al., 2021). In its NDC, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions from gas flaring in the oil and gas sector to less than half of 2015 levels and lists some unquantified measures in the waste sector. However, it is unclear whether these measures are sufficient to reach the 2030 global goal of reducing methane emissions by 30%—especially given the planned increase in oil and gas production. The agriculture sector, a large source of methane emissions, is not covered in Egypt’s NDC.
- **Coal Exit**: Egypt is a signatory of the coal exit pledge. It does not have any coal plants currently. Its electricity generation is largely based on fossil gas, with coal being primarily used for industrial production (IEA, 2021a).
- **Beyond oil & gas**: Egypt is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Egypt plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.

## Energy supply

As part of its Vision 2030 sustainable development strategy, Egypt aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector by 10% by 2030. No baseline is given, but we assume it to be 2015, as that is around the time the strategy was developed.

Egypt’s economy is highly dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which represented nearly a quarter of GDP in 2019–2020 (U.S. ITA, 2021). The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021).

Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022). Egypt has:

- The third largest proven gas reserves in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria
- The second largest gas production, after Algeria
- The highest gas consumption, making up over a third of Africa’s total gas consumption
- The highest CO2 emissions from gas, making up nearly 40% of the continent’s total CO2 emissions linked to fossil gas.
Egypt’s fossil gas reserves are estimated at 1,780 bcm (63 Tcf) in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). In 2015, the Italian company ENI discovered the Mediterranean’s largest offshore gas field in Egypt’s waters (Government of Egypt, 2020a). The government estimates the reserves at around 850 bcm (30 Tcf)—although these are still unproven, and therefore not included in most official statistics at this stage.

In 2019, Egypt’s fossil gas production reached a high of 64 bcm, representing over a fourth of total gas production in Africa. Egypt has significantly ramped up its fossil gas production in the past few years, after a steep decline that followed the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

Despite this Egypt’s fossil gas exports remain much smaller compared to other major producers on the continent, due to steadily increasing domestic demand. However, the Egyptian government has clearly stated its intention to rapidly increase gas exports to cater to higher demand, in particular from Europe. Following Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, Egypt ramped up gas exports to European countries (S&P Global, 2023).

The Egyptian government hopes to position the country as a regional energy hub. In June 2022, the EU signed a deal with Egypt and Israel aimed at increasing the volumes of fossil gas exports to Europe. Israel is sending gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt, which is then re-exported to Europe as LNG from Egyptians ports (Reuters, 2023). To meet Europe’s fossil gas demand, Egypt plans to both pump more gas and receive more flows from Israel.

However, there are uncertainties about Egypt’s future LNG exports due to rising domestic demand and infrastructure constraints. The Egyptian government recently announced that it would only be able to significantly increase its gas exports from 2025 (Bloomberg, 2023).

Egypt’s fossil gas strategy could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Further, our 2022 analysis shows that a high share of renewables in the power sector (82% in 2035) could create an additional 1.8 million jobs compared to the government’s 2035 Energy Strategy — translating to nearly 130,000 additional jobs per year. A high share of renewable energy (82% by 2035) could also avoid more than 5,300 premature deaths linked to air pollution from fossil gas in the next two decades compared to the 2035 Energy Strategy, which foresees over 50% of electricity to be generated with gas in 2035.

Egypt’s oil production has been on a slow decline over the past two decades (IEA, 2019).

In 2018, Egypt joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring Initiative, which commits governments and oil companies to end gas flaring in oil production by 2030 (GGFR, 2022). In the last three years, Egypt has reduced gas flaring, thanks to investment in additional pipeline infrastructure (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023).

The majority of Egypt’s electricity is from fossil gas (IEA, 2019). Oil is a distant second, though together the two provide 90% of the country’s power. In absolute terms, the contribution from hydropower has changed little in the past three decades, but its overall share has fallen substantially as electricity demand has grown. In 2019, 7% of electricity was from hydropower, followed by wind (2%) and solar (1%).

It is difficult to assess Egypt’s electricity plans. Its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 has not been updated since 2016 and its five-year plans are hard to access.

The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 (ISES 2016), adopted by the Supreme Energy Council, Egypt’s top energy decision-making body, in October 2016, outlines the country’s vision for the energy sector. Eight scenarios were considered as part of the strategy development. The scenario ultimately adopted sets targets to generate 20% of electricity from renewable sources in 2022, increasing to 42% by 2035. With the recent NDC update, the renewable energy target was revised to 42% of renewable energy in Egypt’s electricity mix by 2030 (Government of Egypt, 2023).

The scenario adopted also includes nuclear and coal power. However, as discussed below, the nuclear plant has been delayed and the coal plants shelved.

IRENA estimates that Egypt could derive more than half (53%) of its electricity from renewables in 2030. This projection exceeds the government’s new renewable energy target, which aims to generate 42% of electricity from renewables by 2030 (IRENA, 2018).

Egypt has initiated some large-scale renewable energy projects, including the 1.6 GW Benban solar power plant. By the end of 2022, Egypt had installed around 1.6 GW of wind capacity and 1.7 GW of solar capacity—in addition to the existing 2.8 GW of hydropower (IRENA, 2023). However, the government will need to speed up renewable energy installation if it hopes to meet its new 2030 target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated, with installed capacity at 19% (World Bank, 2022).

In November 2021, the government imposed a 5% import tariff on solar panels, which had previously been duty free (Enterprise, 2021d).

Egypt is currently building its first nuclear power plant, though the project has suffered repeated delays (World Nuclear Association, 2023)Click or tap here to enter text.. The project is being developed in cooperation with, and largely financed by, Russia.

The site for the 4.8 GW plant, consisting of four 1.2 GW units, was approved in 2019, with construction originally scheduled for late 2020. However, the request for construction permits of the first two units was only made in mid-2021. After multiple delays, approval was finally granted at the end of 2022 (World Nuclear Association, 2023). The first reactor was originally supposed to come online in 2026, but has been delayed until 2028, with all units operational by 2030. The plant has a design life of 60+ years.

Egypt does not have any coal-fired power plants (Global Energy Monitor, 2023). The interest in coal power sprung out of the energy crisis in 2014 and the desire to reduce Egypt’s dependence on imported gas and was included in the 2030 Vision. However, the discovery of gas fields and their subsequent rapid development has changed the situation dramatically, as Egypt became a net exporter of gas in 2019.

In 2020, the government announced it had indefinitely postponed plans to construct the 6 GW Hamrawein coal-fired power plant, instead pursuing alternative renewable energy projects (Daily News Egypt, 2020). As a signatory of the Clean Power Transition Statement, Egypt has committed to not building any unabated coal-fired power generation in the future (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).

Egypt aims to become a hub for hydrogen production. At COP27, Egypt released an outline of its Low-carbon Hydrogen strategy, which set the objective to capture 5% of the global hydrogen market by 2040 (Reuters, 2022).

The Egyptian government has signed an MoU with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to develop the framework of Egypt’s hydrogen strategy. The EBRD will analyse global hydrogen market trends, Egypt's hydrogen production capabilities, and assess storage, conversion, and transportation methods. Several pilot projects are underway.

However, Egypt's definition of “low carbon” hydrogen remains ambiguous. To be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Egypt’s hydrogen strategy should exclusively focus on the production of green hydrogen (i.e., derived from renewable energy), and not hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

The government had originally planned to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies entirely by mid 2022, but has pushed the date back to mid 2025, in part over concerns of rising consumer prices (Enterprise, 2021c).


## Industry

Coal consumption in the industry sector increased substantially between 2016 and 2018, as the sector shifted away from fossil gas due to limited supply (IEA, 2021). Coal consumption somewhat decreased in 2019 but remains relatively high.

Emissions from Egypt’s cement sector have been on the rise due to increased production and a switch from gas to coal during the energy crisis in 2014 (EBRD, 2016).

In April 2015, Egypt passed legislation that allowed cement producers to switch from gas to coal in response to a nationwide energy crisis (EBRD, 2016). At the time, it was estimated that the switch would cause a 15% increase in CO2 emissions from the sector by 2030 (EBRD, 2016). A strategy was developed to counteract this increase with a suite of measures, full implementation of which could even have led to a reduction in emissions, not just a return to the pre-fuel switching baseline (EBRD, 2016). However, there is no information available on the progress of this policy.

The Egyptian, and the broader regional cement industry has also been plagued by oversupply for years (Vanderborght et al., 2016). While the strategy mentioned above noted that no new capacity was needed until 2025, a new state-owned facility was opened in 2018, further exacerbating the oversupply issue (EBRD, 2017; Enterprise, 2021b) . The drop in demand in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse.

Around 90% of the sector currently uses coal in at least part of their manufacturing process. Soaring coal prices in 2021 has some considering a switch back to gas, but its prices are also increasing (Enterprise, 2021a).

The Egyptian Waste Management Regulatory Authority is working on regulations that would require cement companies to use alternative fuels and waste materials in their production instead of coal, one of the recommended measures in the 2016 strategy (Enterprise, 2021a).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 30% of Egypt’s total energy consumption. Transport emissions have increased by 75% from 2005 to 2019 (World Bank, 2022). In its NDC, Egypt pledged to reduce emissions in the sector by 7% by 2030.

Fossil gas use in the transport sector is low but expected to increase. In 2020, the Egyptian government announced a nationwide programme to convert over 400,000 cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) by 2023, bringing the total number of cars running on gas to one million. The Central Bank of Egypt is supporting this initiative by providing loans with initial support amounting to nearly USD 1 billion (EIU, 2021). While CNG may be seen as a cleaner alternative to oil-fuelled cars, it is by no means a solution for air pollution. CNG-fuelled cars emit a significant amount of particle pollution—both ultrafine and PM2.5 (Transport & Environment, 2020).

The Egyptian EV market is in its infancy with only a few thousand cars on the road (The National, 2023). High prices, limited charging infrastructure and a challenging regulatory environment, both for the individual driver and the sector are all barriers to growth.

The government plans to subsidise the purchase of locally produced EVs and has set a goal of installing 3,000 charging stations by 2023 (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021). In April 2021, a committee was established by the Ministry for Public Enterprise to look into the location of the charging stations (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021a). Current numbers are difficult to come by; however, one of the leading installers has already built 70 stations with plans to expand to 300 by 2023 (Infinity, 2022).

The Ministry of Military Production, which has significant manufacturing capabilities, is developing an EV industry strategy that seeks to promote local production (New & Renewable Energy Authority, 2020). However, a concrete document has yet to be released. Egypt aims to be a key exporter of EVs by 2040. GM and Mercedes Benz are working with Egyptian partners to explore the possibility of local EV production (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021d). Negotiations between a Chinese automaker and Egyptian entities for local EV production faltered in late 2021, though some prototype testing did occur during the year. State-owned entities have also partner with local manufacturers to produce electric buses (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021b, 2021e).

Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain discussed developing the region’s first joint EV manufacturing deal during the Higher Committee of Integrated Partnership meeting held in Cairo in March 2023. The four countries signed several industrial partnerships, including an agreement to build three EV factories across Egypt, Jordan and the UAE (Zawya, 2023).

Importing used cars is banned in Egypt; however, the ban was relaxed in 2018 to allow for the importation of used EVs that are not more than three years old (Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2021).


## Waste

In October 2020, Egypt adopted a new waste management law (Enterprise, 2020a). Effective waste management has been a challenge for the country for the last decade. In September 2021, a public-private partnership was formed to build the first waste-to-energy plant (Green Tech Egypt, 2021b, 2021a). A waste-to-energy feed in tariff to support such projects was adopted in 2019; however, as electricity is currently in oversupply, this measure may do little to support the industry in practice (Enterprise, 2020c; Riad & Riad, 2020).


# Sources


# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC

Egypt’s updated NDC target is expressed as a reduction below a BAU scenario. Egypt’s NDC only provides BAU values for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors. For energy-related CO2 emissions not covered by electricity and transport, we have used a reference scenario from IRENA’s Renewable Energy Outlook report to estimate the BAU values (IRENA, 2018). For other sectors and gases (including the “associated gases” oil & gas sub-sector), we have used a ten-year trend (2006–2015) up to the 2015 baseline year specified in the NDC. As Egypt’s NDC only covers emissions from CO2, CH4 and N20, we have used our current policy projections values for F-gases (instead of estimating a business-as-usual scenario).

We have used the reductions in Egypt’s NDC for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sectors. These reductions represent the upper end of the conditional NDC quantification. For the lower end of the range, we also estimated emissions reductions from the industry and buildings sectors.

Egypt’s NDC refers to the Low-Carbon Roadmap for Egypt’s Cement Sector, which targets a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions from the cement sector (Vanderborght et al., 2016). As cement represents a large share of Egypt’s CO2 emissions in the industry sector, we have assumed this reduction applies to the entire sector and subtracted it from our industry BAU (IRENA’s reference scenario for industry) (IRENA, 2018). For the buildings sector, we have assumed an 8% reduction below IRENA’s reference scenario, in line with the reduction in non-renewable energy use between 2015 and 2030 in IRENA’s enhanced renewable energy (REmap) scenario compared to the reference one in 2030.

Egypt’s NDC uses the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. The CAT expresses emissions in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWPs. For the transport and electricity sectors, we have used the original values from Egypt’s NDC, as most of the emissions in those sectors are from CO2. In 2015, 98% of transport emissions and nearly 100% of emissions from energy industries were from CO2 according to Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report. For the oil & gas sub-sector, we have assumed all emissions are methane, and have converted values from SAR to AR4 GWP.


## Current policy projections

We derive the range of projections under current policies according to the following method:

Lower end of the range: Historical data shows that per capita emissions have been largely stable in the past. We assume that this correlation remains and apply the average per capita emissions to UN population prospects until 2030.

Upper end of the range: We use projections from the IRENA RE Outlook for Egypt for energy related CO2 emissions. For all other emissions, we assume a continued trend of past emissions up to 2030.

We further investigate the impact of the RE targets on emissions. Meeting the target does not decrease emissions of the upper end of the range beyond the lower end. Even when assuming a lower electricity generation growth than in the IRENA reference scenario, the emissions reductions compared to the reference do not lead to lower emissions. We thus assume that the target is covered by our range.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target overview

Egypt submitted its second, updated NDC to the UNFCCC on 26 June 2023, strengthening only its emissions reduction target in the power sector.

Egypt’s NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions reduction target but rather presents emissions reductions to be achieved in the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors (Government of Egypt, 2023). Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC. The lack of transparency in the NDC makes any assessment of the targets difficult.

The NDC is conditional on Egypt receiving international support. Egypt does not specify whether any portion of the NDC is unconditional.

We estimate Egypt can easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it has already put in place, and it should therefore submit a strengthened target that incentivises additional emission reductions.

Egypt does not have a net-zero emissions target, nor has it submitted a Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC as of July 2023.

* See Assumptions section for a discussion on GWP values.


## NDC updates

Egypt submitted its second updated NDC on 26 June 2023 (Government of Egypt, 2023). This update is exactly the same as the previous, 2022, submission, with the exception of the revised renewable energy target.

Egypt has now committed to achieving 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030, five years earlier than under the previous NDC. Consequently, Egypt strengthened its emissions reduction target in the power sector by 10 MtCO2e or 14% compared to the previous target. However, since this revised target is the only modification, the overall impact of this NDC update remains minor.

The new NDC target is conditional on international support and Egypt still does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. The CAT estimates Egypt can easily achieve this target – even without international support – and should therefore substantially strengthen it.

The new NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions target but instead includes emissions reductions to be achieved in the following sub-sectors: electricity, transport and oil & gas.

By 2030, Egypt pledges to the following emissions levels in these sectors:

- Electricity: 134* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 215* MtCO2e)
- Transport: 115* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 124* MtCO2e)
- Oil & gas production (associated gases sub-sector): 1.1 MtCO2e1 (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 3.1 MtCO2e2)
*NOTE: The figures used in Egypt’s NDC use global warming potential values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We have not converted the values from electricity and transport to AR4 values as CO2 is the dominant gas (see the Assumptions section for further details).

These three sectors accounted for 43% of Egypt’s total GHG emissions3 in 2015, the baseline year. In total, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions by 92 MtCO2e compared to a business-as-usual pathway in these sectors.

The revised target for the electricity sector is more ambitious than the previous one, as Egypt aims to reach it five years earlier and clarifies that it pertains to the share of electricity generation rather than capacity.

Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC.

We estimate the conditional NDC target would lead to emissions increasing from around 345 MtCO2 today to 496–512 MtCO2e in 2030. The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030.

Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC. We have estimated a BAU scenario using the values provided for electricity, transport and oil & gas and estimating emissions for the remaining sectors using historical trends. The upper end of our target range is based on the quantified reductions for the three sub-sectors only. For the lower end, we also estimated some of the emissions reductions for the policies and measures proposed for the industry and buildings sector. For more details on our calculations, please refer to the assumptions section.

See Assumptions section for further details on conversion.3Expressed in AR4 Global Warming Potential.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.

Egypt only has a conditional target. We rate the conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). Egypt does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. In the absence of a target, we use our estimate for Egypt’s business-as-usual target as its unconditional target.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates Egypt’s conditional target “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s conditional NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

BAU Scenario against fair share

In the absence of an unconditional NDC emissions reduction target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated ‘business as usual’ scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient**”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s (estimated) target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).


# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.


# Governance


## Climate Governance Series

In March 2022, the CAT released its assessment of Egypt’s climate governance readiness. A summary of the report is below. The full report is available here.


## Egypt country profile

**President El-Sisi has not been a strong advocate of the need to transition the Egyptian society and economy towards net zero emissions.**. He has traditionally focused on the importance of climate adaptation and emphasised the need for climate finance from developed countries. More broadly, **expanding the country’s fossil gas production is a top priority for government officials, both for the country’s own energy security and as a valuable export commodity**, not starting on the path to decarbonisation.

While the climate change lead agency is entrusted with clear legal mandates, it needs greater power to reinforce its position as the lead institution on climate change issues in Egypt.

**There is incremental improvement in Egypt’s climate policy development, but the process is slow**. And, there have been some notable rollbacks, including measures adopted in response to the fuel shortages the country experienced a decade ago, and more recent measures that may dampen the speed of renewable energy uptake.

**The trustworthiness and the accountability of Egypt’s government is considered to be low** both generally and in relation to environmental governance metrics, which may inhibit the transition. Constitutional addendums passed in 2019 mean that the President could stay in power until 2030. The extent to which there is broadscale political support for the transition to a zero emissions society is somewhat moot against such a backdrop.

The National Council for Climate Change (NCCC) is an inter-ministerial committee and the key-decision body responsible for coordinating climate policy development and implementation across ministries and agencies. Assessing its effectiveness is difficult as information on the workings of the Council is limited. Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms.

**Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.** Egypt announced its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) in November 2021 and launched it in May 2022. Egypt’s numerous policies and strategy documents are generally aligned, though these are not transition focused and not updated frequently.

Egypt does not have an authoritative body with an explicit mandate to provide the government with transition-related advice, though some agencies may be capable of playing such a role. The government does consider external advice as part of its policy-development process.

**While the country has a high level of climate finance readiness in some areas, the financial and technical resources of the Ministry of Environment need to be improved.** Some specific technical capacities within the Ministry are lacking, such as GHG inventory preparation and funding proposals preparation, so it relies on external consultants. However, overall the Ministry is run by well-qualified staff who enable the lead agency, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), to build continuous institutional learning.

Egypt’s processes to develop, implement and track the policies needed to enable the transition are weak. **The country has not adopted a net zero target, nor has it set out a pathway to achieve it**.

The country’s existing legal architecture is comprised of piecemeal sectoral legislation which may help climate mitigation, but it lacks comprehensive, climate-focused legislation to support the transition. **A legislative review is underway to include climate change in all relevant laws, though no timeline for its completion has been given.** Implementation of existing regulations has also been problematic: enforcement of building sector energy use and efficient regulations are a case in point.

**Egypt does not have a comprehensive transparency framework.** A proposal was developed a few years ago, but it has not yet been adopted by the government. GHG inventories are an exception, with evidence of improvement at the national and sub-national level. **Egypt has not established a formal review mechanism for transition-related policies, nor is there evidence of any domestic ratchet-up mechanism.**

**Stakeholders are consulted as part of the decision-making process; however the scope and the depth of those consultations is difficult to gauge.** Consultations take place against a backdrop of low levels of public understanding of climate change - only about 40% of Egyptians consider that they know at least a moderate amount about climate change. Civil society is active in the climate space, but often faces capacity limitations, and recent legislative reforms have curtailed the ability of these groups to function.

**Egypt lacks a comprehensive strategy to ensure a Just Transition, but has had some success with the phasing out of its energy subsidies and the promotion of green jobs.** The full phase-out of consumption subsidies has been pushed back to mid 2025, due, in part, to concerns of rising consumer prices.

**The military is heavily involved in Egypt’s economy, especially in major public infrastructure projects**, which likely lessens the effect non-state actors can have on the government compared to other countries. This involvement is in activities that both support and potentially hinder the transition.

As the COP27 host in 2022, there was the potential for Egypt to improve on a number of governance metrics. However, the NDC submitted in July 2023 offered little improvements.

# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Egypt has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. In 2021, Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.


## Policy overview

Egypt’s main mitigation policies are set out in its second NDC update and its 2030 low emissions development strategy, which was adopted in early 2019 (Osama et al., 2019; Government of Egypt, 2023). In May 2022, Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, which does not include an overall emissions reduction goal.

In its second NDC update, Egypt strengthened its renewable energy target, pledging to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030. However, the government will need to significantly boost renewable energy deployment if it hopes to meet this revised target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

While Egypt is looking to ramp up renewable energy deployment, its primary focus remains the expansion of fossil gas production. The government recently unveiled plans to increase fossil gas exports, and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. This could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Egypt’s Vision 2030, developed in 2014–2015, is the country’s overarching sustainable development strategy. Climate change does not feature prominently, and the Vision does not include an economy-wide emission reduction target; however, it does have a few mitigation-related sectoral targets.

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane**: In June 2022, Egypt joined the Global Methane Pledge. Half of Egypt’s methane emissions come from the waste sector and a third from agriculture, the remainder are from energy (Gütschow et al., 2021). In its NDC, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions from gas flaring in the oil and gas sector to less than half of 2015 levels and lists some unquantified measures in the waste sector. However, it is unclear whether these measures are sufficient to reach the 2030 global goal of reducing methane emissions by 30%—especially given the planned increase in oil and gas production. The agriculture sector, a large source of methane emissions, is not covered in Egypt’s NDC.
- **Coal Exit**: Egypt is a signatory of the coal exit pledge. It does not have any coal plants currently. Its electricity generation is largely based on fossil gas, with coal being primarily used for industrial production (IEA, 2021a).
- **Beyond oil & gas**: Egypt is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Egypt plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.

## Energy supply

As part of its Vision 2030 sustainable development strategy, Egypt aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector by 10% by 2030. No baseline is given, but we assume it to be 2015, as that is around the time the strategy was developed.

Egypt’s economy is highly dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which represented nearly a quarter of GDP in 2019–2020 (U.S. ITA, 2021). The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021).

Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022). Egypt has:

- The third largest proven gas reserves in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria
- The second largest gas production, after Algeria
- The highest gas consumption, making up over a third of Africa’s total gas consumption
- The highest CO2 emissions from gas, making up nearly 40% of the continent’s total CO2 emissions linked to fossil gas.
Egypt’s fossil gas reserves are estimated at 1,780 bcm (63 Tcf) in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). In 2015, the Italian company ENI discovered the Mediterranean’s largest offshore gas field in Egypt’s waters (Government of Egypt, 2020a). The government estimates the reserves at around 850 bcm (30 Tcf)—although these are still unproven, and therefore not included in most official statistics at this stage.

In 2019, Egypt’s fossil gas production reached a high of 64 bcm, representing over a fourth of total gas production in Africa. Egypt has significantly ramped up its fossil gas production in the past few years, after a steep decline that followed the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

Despite this Egypt’s fossil gas exports remain much smaller compared to other major producers on the continent, due to steadily increasing domestic demand. However, the Egyptian government has clearly stated its intention to rapidly increase gas exports to cater to higher demand, in particular from Europe. Following Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, Egypt ramped up gas exports to European countries (S&P Global, 2023).

The Egyptian government hopes to position the country as a regional energy hub. In June 2022, the EU signed a deal with Egypt and Israel aimed at increasing the volumes of fossil gas exports to Europe. Israel is sending gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt, which is then re-exported to Europe as LNG from Egyptians ports (Reuters, 2023). To meet Europe’s fossil gas demand, Egypt plans to both pump more gas and receive more flows from Israel.

However, there are uncertainties about Egypt’s future LNG exports due to rising domestic demand and infrastructure constraints. The Egyptian government recently announced that it would only be able to significantly increase its gas exports from 2025 (Bloomberg, 2023).

Egypt’s fossil gas strategy could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Further, our 2022 analysis shows that a high share of renewables in the power sector (82% in 2035) could create an additional 1.8 million jobs compared to the government’s 2035 Energy Strategy — translating to nearly 130,000 additional jobs per year. A high share of renewable energy (82% by 2035) could also avoid more than 5,300 premature deaths linked to air pollution from fossil gas in the next two decades compared to the 2035 Energy Strategy, which foresees over 50% of electricity to be generated with gas in 2035.

Egypt’s oil production has been on a slow decline over the past two decades (IEA, 2019).

In 2018, Egypt joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring Initiative, which commits governments and oil companies to end gas flaring in oil production by 2030 (GGFR, 2022). In the last three years, Egypt has reduced gas flaring, thanks to investment in additional pipeline infrastructure (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023).

The majority of Egypt’s electricity is from fossil gas (IEA, 2019). Oil is a distant second, though together the two provide 90% of the country’s power. In absolute terms, the contribution from hydropower has changed little in the past three decades, but its overall share has fallen substantially as electricity demand has grown. In 2019, 7% of electricity was from hydropower, followed by wind (2%) and solar (1%).

It is difficult to assess Egypt’s electricity plans. Its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 has not been updated since 2016 and its five-year plans are hard to access.

The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 (ISES 2016), adopted by the Supreme Energy Council, Egypt’s top energy decision-making body, in October 2016, outlines the country’s vision for the energy sector. Eight scenarios were considered as part of the strategy development. The scenario ultimately adopted sets targets to generate 20% of electricity from renewable sources in 2022, increasing to 42% by 2035. With the recent NDC update, the renewable energy target was revised to 42% of renewable energy in Egypt’s electricity mix by 2030 (Government of Egypt, 2023).

The scenario adopted also includes nuclear and coal power. However, as discussed below, the nuclear plant has been delayed and the coal plants shelved.

IRENA estimates that Egypt could derive more than half (53%) of its electricity from renewables in 2030. This projection exceeds the government’s new renewable energy target, which aims to generate 42% of electricity from renewables by 2030 (IRENA, 2018).

Egypt has initiated some large-scale renewable energy projects, including the 1.6 GW Benban solar power plant. By the end of 2022, Egypt had installed around 1.6 GW of wind capacity and 1.7 GW of solar capacity—in addition to the existing 2.8 GW of hydropower (IRENA, 2023). However, the government will need to speed up renewable energy installation if it hopes to meet its new 2030 target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated, with installed capacity at 19% (World Bank, 2022).

In November 2021, the government imposed a 5% import tariff on solar panels, which had previously been duty free (Enterprise, 2021d).

Egypt is currently building its first nuclear power plant, though the project has suffered repeated delays (World Nuclear Association, 2023)Click or tap here to enter text.. The project is being developed in cooperation with, and largely financed by, Russia.

The site for the 4.8 GW plant, consisting of four 1.2 GW units, was approved in 2019, with construction originally scheduled for late 2020. However, the request for construction permits of the first two units was only made in mid-2021. After multiple delays, approval was finally granted at the end of 2022 (World Nuclear Association, 2023). The first reactor was originally supposed to come online in 2026, but has been delayed until 2028, with all units operational by 2030. The plant has a design life of 60+ years.

Egypt does not have any coal-fired power plants (Global Energy Monitor, 2023). The interest in coal power sprung out of the energy crisis in 2014 and the desire to reduce Egypt’s dependence on imported gas and was included in the 2030 Vision. However, the discovery of gas fields and their subsequent rapid development has changed the situation dramatically, as Egypt became a net exporter of gas in 2019.

In 2020, the government announced it had indefinitely postponed plans to construct the 6 GW Hamrawein coal-fired power plant, instead pursuing alternative renewable energy projects (Daily News Egypt, 2020). As a signatory of the Clean Power Transition Statement, Egypt has committed to not building any unabated coal-fired power generation in the future (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).

Egypt aims to become a hub for hydrogen production. At COP27, Egypt released an outline of its Low-carbon Hydrogen strategy, which set the objective to capture 5% of the global hydrogen market by 2040 (Reuters, 2022).

The Egyptian government has signed an MoU with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to develop the framework of Egypt’s hydrogen strategy. The EBRD will analyse global hydrogen market trends, Egypt's hydrogen production capabilities, and assess storage, conversion, and transportation methods. Several pilot projects are underway.

However, Egypt's definition of “low carbon” hydrogen remains ambiguous. To be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Egypt’s hydrogen strategy should exclusively focus on the production of green hydrogen (i.e., derived from renewable energy), and not hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

The government had originally planned to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies entirely by mid 2022, but has pushed the date back to mid 2025, in part over concerns of rising consumer prices (Enterprise, 2021c).


## Industry

Coal consumption in the industry sector increased substantially between 2016 and 2018, as the sector shifted away from fossil gas due to limited supply (IEA, 2021). Coal consumption somewhat decreased in 2019 but remains relatively high.

Emissions from Egypt’s cement sector have been on the rise due to increased production and a switch from gas to coal during the energy crisis in 2014 (EBRD, 2016).

In April 2015, Egypt passed legislation that allowed cement producers to switch from gas to coal in response to a nationwide energy crisis (EBRD, 2016). At the time, it was estimated that the switch would cause a 15% increase in CO2 emissions from the sector by 2030 (EBRD, 2016). A strategy was developed to counteract this increase with a suite of measures, full implementation of which could even have led to a reduction in emissions, not just a return to the pre-fuel switching baseline (EBRD, 2016). However, there is no information available on the progress of this policy.

The Egyptian, and the broader regional cement industry has also been plagued by oversupply for years (Vanderborght et al., 2016). While the strategy mentioned above noted that no new capacity was needed until 2025, a new state-owned facility was opened in 2018, further exacerbating the oversupply issue (EBRD, 2017; Enterprise, 2021b) . The drop in demand in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse.

Around 90% of the sector currently uses coal in at least part of their manufacturing process. Soaring coal prices in 2021 has some considering a switch back to gas, but its prices are also increasing (Enterprise, 2021a).

The Egyptian Waste Management Regulatory Authority is working on regulations that would require cement companies to use alternative fuels and waste materials in their production instead of coal, one of the recommended measures in the 2016 strategy (Enterprise, 2021a).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 30% of Egypt’s total energy consumption. Transport emissions have increased by 75% from 2005 to 2019 (World Bank, 2022). In its NDC, Egypt pledged to reduce emissions in the sector by 7% by 2030.

Fossil gas use in the transport sector is low but expected to increase. In 2020, the Egyptian government announced a nationwide programme to convert over 400,000 cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) by 2023, bringing the total number of cars running on gas to one million. The Central Bank of Egypt is supporting this initiative by providing loans with initial support amounting to nearly USD 1 billion (EIU, 2021). While CNG may be seen as a cleaner alternative to oil-fuelled cars, it is by no means a solution for air pollution. CNG-fuelled cars emit a significant amount of particle pollution—both ultrafine and PM2.5 (Transport & Environment, 2020).

The Egyptian EV market is in its infancy with only a few thousand cars on the road (The National, 2023). High prices, limited charging infrastructure and a challenging regulatory environment, both for the individual driver and the sector are all barriers to growth.

The government plans to subsidise the purchase of locally produced EVs and has set a goal of installing 3,000 charging stations by 2023 (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021). In April 2021, a committee was established by the Ministry for Public Enterprise to look into the location of the charging stations (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021a). Current numbers are difficult to come by; however, one of the leading installers has already built 70 stations with plans to expand to 300 by 2023 (Infinity, 2022).

The Ministry of Military Production, which has significant manufacturing capabilities, is developing an EV industry strategy that seeks to promote local production (New & Renewable Energy Authority, 2020). However, a concrete document has yet to be released. Egypt aims to be a key exporter of EVs by 2040. GM and Mercedes Benz are working with Egyptian partners to explore the possibility of local EV production (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021d). Negotiations between a Chinese automaker and Egyptian entities for local EV production faltered in late 2021, though some prototype testing did occur during the year. State-owned entities have also partner with local manufacturers to produce electric buses (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021b, 2021e).

Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain discussed developing the region’s first joint EV manufacturing deal during the Higher Committee of Integrated Partnership meeting held in Cairo in March 2023. The four countries signed several industrial partnerships, including an agreement to build three EV factories across Egypt, Jordan and the UAE (Zawya, 2023).

Importing used cars is banned in Egypt; however, the ban was relaxed in 2018 to allow for the importation of used EVs that are not more than three years old (Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2021).


## Waste

In October 2020, Egypt adopted a new waste management law (Enterprise, 2020a). Effective waste management has been a challenge for the country for the last decade. In September 2021, a public-private partnership was formed to build the first waste-to-energy plant (Green Tech Egypt, 2021b, 2021a). A waste-to-energy feed in tariff to support such projects was adopted in 2019; however, as electricity is currently in oversupply, this measure may do little to support the industry in practice (Enterprise, 2020c; Riad & Riad, 2020).


# Sources


# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC

Egypt’s updated NDC target is expressed as a reduction below a BAU scenario. Egypt’s NDC only provides BAU values for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors. For energy-related CO2 emissions not covered by electricity and transport, we have used a reference scenario from IRENA’s Renewable Energy Outlook report to estimate the BAU values (IRENA, 2018). For other sectors and gases (including the “associated gases” oil & gas sub-sector), we have used a ten-year trend (2006–2015) up to the 2015 baseline year specified in the NDC. As Egypt’s NDC only covers emissions from CO2, CH4 and N20, we have used our current policy projections values for F-gases (instead of estimating a business-as-usual scenario).

We have used the reductions in Egypt’s NDC for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sectors. These reductions represent the upper end of the conditional NDC quantification. For the lower end of the range, we also estimated emissions reductions from the industry and buildings sectors.

Egypt’s NDC refers to the Low-Carbon Roadmap for Egypt’s Cement Sector, which targets a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions from the cement sector (Vanderborght et al., 2016). As cement represents a large share of Egypt’s CO2 emissions in the industry sector, we have assumed this reduction applies to the entire sector and subtracted it from our industry BAU (IRENA’s reference scenario for industry) (IRENA, 2018). For the buildings sector, we have assumed an 8% reduction below IRENA’s reference scenario, in line with the reduction in non-renewable energy use between 2015 and 2030 in IRENA’s enhanced renewable energy (REmap) scenario compared to the reference one in 2030.

Egypt’s NDC uses the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. The CAT expresses emissions in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWPs. For the transport and electricity sectors, we have used the original values from Egypt’s NDC, as most of the emissions in those sectors are from CO2. In 2015, 98% of transport emissions and nearly 100% of emissions from energy industries were from CO2 according to Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report. For the oil & gas sub-sector, we have assumed all emissions are methane, and have converted values from SAR to AR4 GWP.


## Current policy projections

We derive the range of projections under current policies according to the following method:

Lower end of the range: Historical data shows that per capita emissions have been largely stable in the past. We assume that this correlation remains and apply the average per capita emissions to UN population prospects until 2030.

Upper end of the range: We use projections from the IRENA RE Outlook for Egypt for energy related CO2 emissions. For all other emissions, we assume a continued trend of past emissions up to 2030.

We further investigate the impact of the RE targets on emissions. Meeting the target does not decrease emissions of the upper end of the range beyond the lower end. Even when assuming a lower electricity generation growth than in the IRENA reference scenario, the emissions reductions compared to the reference do not lead to lower emissions. We thus assume that the target is covered by our range.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target overview

Egypt submitted its second, updated NDC to the UNFCCC on 26 June 2023, strengthening only its emissions reduction target in the power sector.

Egypt’s NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions reduction target but rather presents emissions reductions to be achieved in the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors (Government of Egypt, 2023). Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC. The lack of transparency in the NDC makes any assessment of the targets difficult.

The NDC is conditional on Egypt receiving international support. Egypt does not specify whether any portion of the NDC is unconditional.

We estimate Egypt can easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it has already put in place, and it should therefore submit a strengthened target that incentivises additional emission reductions.

Egypt does not have a net-zero emissions target, nor has it submitted a Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC as of July 2023.

* See Assumptions section for a discussion on GWP values.


## NDC updates

Egypt submitted its second updated NDC on 26 June 2023 (Government of Egypt, 2023). This update is exactly the same as the previous, 2022, submission, with the exception of the revised renewable energy target.

Egypt has now committed to achieving 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030, five years earlier than under the previous NDC. Consequently, Egypt strengthened its emissions reduction target in the power sector by 10 MtCO2e or 14% compared to the previous target. However, since this revised target is the only modification, the overall impact of this NDC update remains minor.

The new NDC target is conditional on international support and Egypt still does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. The CAT estimates Egypt can easily achieve this target – even without international support – and should therefore substantially strengthen it.

The new NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions target but instead includes emissions reductions to be achieved in the following sub-sectors: electricity, transport and oil & gas.

By 2030, Egypt pledges to the following emissions levels in these sectors:

- Electricity: 134* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 215* MtCO2e)
- Transport: 115* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 124* MtCO2e)
- Oil & gas production (associated gases sub-sector): 1.1 MtCO2e1 (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 3.1 MtCO2e2)
*NOTE: The figures used in Egypt’s NDC use global warming potential values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We have not converted the values from electricity and transport to AR4 values as CO2 is the dominant gas (see the Assumptions section for further details).

These three sectors accounted for 43% of Egypt’s total GHG emissions3 in 2015, the baseline year. In total, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions by 92 MtCO2e compared to a business-as-usual pathway in these sectors.

The revised target for the electricity sector is more ambitious than the previous one, as Egypt aims to reach it five years earlier and clarifies that it pertains to the share of electricity generation rather than capacity.

Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC.

We estimate the conditional NDC target would lead to emissions increasing from around 345 MtCO2 today to 496–512 MtCO2e in 2030. The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030.

Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC. We have estimated a BAU scenario using the values provided for electricity, transport and oil & gas and estimating emissions for the remaining sectors using historical trends. The upper end of our target range is based on the quantified reductions for the three sub-sectors only. For the lower end, we also estimated some of the emissions reductions for the policies and measures proposed for the industry and buildings sector. For more details on our calculations, please refer to the assumptions section.

See Assumptions section for further details on conversion.3Expressed in AR4 Global Warming Potential. Egypt’s NDC, expressed in SAR GWP, states these sectors accounted for 43% of total emissions in 2015.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.

Egypt only has a conditional target. We rate the conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). Egypt does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. In the absence of a target, we use our estimate for Egypt’s business-as-usual target as its unconditional target.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates Egypt’s conditional target “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s conditional NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

BAU Scenario against fair share

In the absence of an unconditional NDC emissions reduction target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated ‘business as usual’ scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient**”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s (estimated) target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).


# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.


# Governance


## Climate Governance Series

In March 2022, the CAT released its assessment of Egypt’s climate governance readiness. A summary of the report is below. The full report is available here.


## Egypt country profile

**President El-Sisi has not been a strong advocate of the need to transition the Egyptian society and economy towards net zero emissions.**. He has traditionally focused on the importance of climate adaptation and emphasised the need for climate finance from developed countries. More broadly, **expanding the country’s fossil gas production is a top priority for government officials, both for the country’s own energy security and as a valuable export commodity**, not starting on the path to decarbonisation.

While the climate change lead agency is entrusted with clear legal mandates, it needs greater power to reinforce its position as the lead institution on climate change issues in Egypt.

**There is incremental improvement in Egypt’s climate policy development, but the process is slow**. And, there have been some notable rollbacks, including measures adopted in response to the fuel shortages the country experienced a decade ago, and more recent measures that may dampen the speed of renewable energy uptake.

**The trustworthiness and the accountability of Egypt’s government is considered to be low** both generally and in relation to environmental governance metrics, which may inhibit the transition. Constitutional addendums passed in 2019 mean that the President could stay in power until 2030. The extent to which there is broadscale political support for the transition to a zero emissions society is somewhat moot against such a backdrop.

The National Council for Climate Change (NCCC) is an inter-ministerial committee and the key-decision body responsible for coordinating climate policy development and implementation across ministries and agencies. Assessing its effectiveness is difficult as information on the workings of the Council is limited. Transition-related policy development also appears to be taking place in other settings, with the link to the NCCC unclear. Coordination with subnational governments is poor as there are no climate specific coordination mechanisms.

**Mainstreaming the concept of a transition to a zero emissions society within government is in its infancy as Egypt has only recently begun to consider the need for such a transition.** Egypt announced its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) in November 2021 and launched it in May 2022. Egypt’s numerous policies and strategy documents are generally aligned, though these are not transition focused and not updated frequently.

Egypt does not have an authoritative body with an explicit mandate to provide the government with transition-related advice, though some agencies may be capable of playing such a role. The government does consider external advice as part of its policy-development process.

**While the country has a high level of climate finance readiness in some areas, the financial and technical resources of the Ministry of Environment need to be improved.** Some specific technical capacities within the Ministry are lacking, such as GHG inventory preparation and funding proposals preparation, so it relies on external consultants. However, overall the Ministry is run by well-qualified staff who enable the lead agency, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), to build continuous institutional learning.

Egypt’s processes to develop, implement and track the policies needed to enable the transition are weak. **The country has not adopted a net zero target, nor has it set out a pathway to achieve it**.

The country’s existing legal architecture is comprised of piecemeal sectoral legislation which may help climate mitigation, but it lacks comprehensive, climate-focused legislation to support the transition. **A legislative review is underway to include climate change in all relevant laws, though no timeline for its completion has been given.** Implementation of existing regulations has also been problematic: enforcement of building sector energy use and efficient regulations are a case in point.

**Egypt does not have a comprehensive transparency framework.** A proposal was developed a few years ago, but it has not yet been adopted by the government. GHG inventories are an exception, with evidence of improvement at the national and sub-national level. **Egypt has not established a formal review mechanism for transition-related policies, nor is there evidence of any domestic ratchet-up mechanism.**

**Stakeholders are consulted as part of the decision-making process; however the scope and the depth of those consultations is difficult to gauge.** Consultations take place against a backdrop of low levels of public understanding of climate change - only about 40% of Egyptians consider that they know at least a moderate amount about climate change. Civil society is active in the climate space, but often faces capacity limitations, and recent legislative reforms have curtailed the ability of these groups to function.

**Egypt lacks a comprehensive strategy to ensure a Just Transition, but has had some success with the phasing out of its energy subsidies and the promotion of green jobs.** The full phase-out of consumption subsidies has been pushed back to mid 2025, due, in part, to concerns of rising consumer prices.

**The military is heavily involved in Egypt’s economy, especially in major public infrastructure projects**, which likely lessens the effect non-state actors can have on the government compared to other countries. This involvement is in activities that both support and potentially hinder the transition.

As the COP27 host in 2022, there was the potential for Egypt to improve on a number of governance metrics. However, the NDC submitted in July 2023 offered little improvements.

# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Egypt has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. In 2021, Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.


## Policy overview

Egypt’s main mitigation policies are set out in its second NDC update and its 2030 low emissions development strategy, which was adopted in early 2019 (Osama et al., 2019; Government of Egypt, 2023). In May 2022, Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, which does not include an overall emissions reduction goal.

In its second NDC update, Egypt strengthened its renewable energy target, pledging to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030. However, the government will need to significantly boost renewable energy deployment if it hopes to meet this revised target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

While Egypt is looking to ramp up renewable energy deployment, its primary focus remains the expansion of fossil gas production. The government recently unveiled plans to increase fossil gas exports, and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. This could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Egypt’s Vision 2030, developed in 2014–2015, is the country’s overarching sustainable development strategy. Climate change does not feature prominently, and the Vision does not include an economy-wide emission reduction target; however, it does have a few mitigation-related sectoral targets.

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane**: In June 2022, Egypt joined the Global Methane Pledge. Half of Egypt’s methane emissions come from the waste sector and a third from agriculture, the remainder are from energy (Gütschow et al., 2021). In its NDC, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions from gas flaring in the oil and gas sector to less than half of 2015 levels and lists some unquantified measures in the waste sector. However, it is unclear whether these measures are sufficient to reach the 2030 global goal of reducing methane emissions by 30%—especially given the planned increase in oil and gas production. The agriculture sector, a large source of methane emissions, is not covered in Egypt’s NDC.
- **Coal Exit**: Egypt is a signatory of the coal exit pledge. It does not have any coal plants currently. Its electricity generation is largely based on fossil gas, with coal being primarily used for industrial production (IEA, 2021a).
- **Beyond oil & gas**: Egypt is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Egypt plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.

## Energy supply

As part of its Vision 2030 sustainable development strategy, Egypt aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector by 10% by 2030. No baseline is given, but we assume it to be 2015, as that is around the time the strategy was developed.

Egypt’s economy is highly dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which represented nearly a quarter of GDP in 2019–2020 (U.S. ITA, 2021). The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy supplying only 5% of total primary energy in 2019 (IEA, 2021).

Egypt is seeking to develop its vast fossil gas resources to maximise domestic production, consumption and exports. It ranks among Africa’s top countries for many indicators related to fossil gas (EIA, 2022). Egypt has:

- The third largest proven gas reserves in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria
- The second largest gas production, after Algeria
- The highest gas consumption, making up over a third of Africa’s total gas consumption
- The highest CO2 emissions from gas, making up nearly 40% of the continent’s total CO2 emissions linked to fossil gas.
Egypt’s fossil gas reserves are estimated at 1,780 bcm (63 Tcf) in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). In 2015, the Italian company ENI discovered the Mediterranean’s largest offshore gas field in Egypt’s waters (Government of Egypt, 2020a). The government estimates the reserves at around 850 bcm (30 Tcf)—although these are still unproven, and therefore not included in most official statistics at this stage.

In 2019, Egypt’s fossil gas production reached a high of 64 bcm, representing over a fourth of total gas production in Africa. Egypt has significantly ramped up its fossil gas production in the past few years, after a steep decline that followed the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

Despite this Egypt’s fossil gas exports remain much smaller compared to other major producers on the continent, due to steadily increasing domestic demand. However, the Egyptian government has clearly stated its intention to rapidly increase gas exports to cater to higher demand, in particular from Europe. Following Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, Egypt ramped up gas exports to European countries (S&P Global, 2023).

The Egyptian government hopes to position the country as a regional energy hub. In June 2022, the EU signed a deal with Egypt and Israel aimed at increasing the volumes of fossil gas exports to Europe. Israel is sending gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt, which is then re-exported to Europe as LNG from Egyptians ports (Reuters, 2023). To meet Europe’s fossil gas demand, Egypt plans to both pump more gas and receive more flows from Israel.

However, there are uncertainties about Egypt’s future LNG exports due to rising domestic demand and infrastructure constraints. The Egyptian government recently announced that it would only be able to significantly increase its gas exports from 2025 (Bloomberg, 2023).

Egypt’s fossil gas strategy could jeopardise the country’s decarbonisation efforts and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, no new investments should be made into fossil gas production and exploration.

Further, our 2022 analysis shows that a high share of renewables in the power sector (82% in 2035) could create an additional 1.8 million jobs compared to the government’s 2035 Energy Strategy — translating to nearly 130,000 additional jobs per year. A high share of renewable energy (82% by 2035) could also avoid more than 5,300 premature deaths linked to air pollution from fossil gas in the next two decades compared to the 2035 Energy Strategy, which foresees over 50% of electricity to be generated with gas in 2035.

Egypt’s oil production has been on a slow decline over the past two decades (IEA, 2019).

In 2018, Egypt joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring Initiative, which commits governments and oil companies to end gas flaring in oil production by 2030 (GGFR, 2022). In the last three years, Egypt has reduced gas flaring, thanks to investment in additional pipeline infrastructure (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023).

The majority of Egypt’s electricity is from fossil gas (IEA, 2019). Oil is a distant second, though together the two provide 90% of the country’s power. In absolute terms, the contribution from hydropower has changed little in the past three decades, but its overall share has fallen substantially as electricity demand has grown. In 2019, 7% of electricity was from hydropower, followed by wind (2%) and solar (1%).

It is difficult to assess Egypt’s electricity plans. Its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 has not been updated since 2016 and its five-year plans are hard to access.

The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035 (ISES 2016), adopted by the Supreme Energy Council, Egypt’s top energy decision-making body, in October 2016, outlines the country’s vision for the energy sector. Eight scenarios were considered as part of the strategy development. The scenario ultimately adopted sets targets to generate 20% of electricity from renewable sources in 2022, increasing to 42% by 2035. With the recent NDC update, the renewable energy target was revised to 42% of renewable energy in Egypt’s electricity mix by 2030 (Government of Egypt, 2023).

The scenario adopted also includes nuclear and coal power. However, as discussed below, the nuclear plant has been delayed and the coal plants shelved.

IRENA estimates that Egypt could derive more than half (53%) of its electricity from renewables in 2030. This projection exceeds the government’s new renewable energy target, which aims to generate 42% of electricity from renewables by 2030 (IRENA, 2018).

Egypt has initiated some large-scale renewable energy projects, including the 1.6 GW Benban solar power plant. By the end of 2022, Egypt had installed around 1.6 GW of wind capacity and 1.7 GW of solar capacity—in addition to the existing 2.8 GW of hydropower (IRENA, 2023). However, the government will need to speed up renewable energy installation if it hopes to meet its new 2030 target. In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated, with installed capacity at 19% (World Bank, 2022).

In November 2021, the government imposed a 5% import tariff on solar panels, which had previously been duty free (Enterprise, 2021d).

Egypt is currently building its first nuclear power plant, though the project has suffered repeated delays (World Nuclear Association, 2023)Click or tap here to enter text.. The project is being developed in cooperation with, and largely financed by, Russia.

The site for the 4.8 GW plant, consisting of four 1.2 GW units, was approved in 2019, with construction originally scheduled for late 2020. However, the request for construction permits of the first two units was only made in mid-2021. After multiple delays, approval was finally granted at the end of 2022 (World Nuclear Association, 2023). The first reactor was originally supposed to come online in 2026, but has been delayed until 2028, with all units operational by 2030. The plant has a design life of 60+ years.

Egypt does not have any coal-fired power plants (Global Energy Monitor, 2023). The interest in coal power sprung out of the energy crisis in 2014 and the desire to reduce Egypt’s dependence on imported gas and was included in the 2030 Vision. However, the discovery of gas fields and their subsequent rapid development has changed the situation dramatically, as Egypt became a net exporter of gas in 2019.

In 2020, the government announced it had indefinitely postponed plans to construct the 6 GW Hamrawein coal-fired power plant, instead pursuing alternative renewable energy projects (Daily News Egypt, 2020). As a signatory of the Clean Power Transition Statement, Egypt has committed to not building any unabated coal-fired power generation in the future (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).

Egypt aims to become a hub for hydrogen production. At COP27, Egypt released an outline of its Low-carbon Hydrogen strategy, which set the objective to capture 5% of the global hydrogen market by 2040 (Reuters, 2022).

The Egyptian government has signed an MoU with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to develop the framework of Egypt’s hydrogen strategy. The EBRD will analyse global hydrogen market trends, Egypt's hydrogen production capabilities, and assess storage, conversion, and transportation methods. Several pilot projects are underway.

However, Egypt's definition of “low carbon” hydrogen remains ambiguous. To be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Egypt’s hydrogen strategy should exclusively focus on the production of green hydrogen (i.e., derived from renewable energy), and not hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

The government had originally planned to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies entirely by mid 2022, but has pushed the date back to mid 2025, in part over concerns of rising consumer prices (Enterprise, 2021c).


## Industry

Coal consumption in the industry sector increased substantially between 2016 and 2018, as the sector shifted away from fossil gas due to limited supply (IEA, 2021). Coal consumption somewhat decreased in 2019 but remains relatively high.

Emissions from Egypt’s cement sector have been on the rise due to increased production and a switch from gas to coal during the energy crisis in 2014 (EBRD, 2016).

In April 2015, Egypt passed legislation that allowed cement producers to switch from gas to coal in response to a nationwide energy crisis (EBRD, 2016). At the time, it was estimated that the switch would cause a 15% increase in CO2 emissions from the sector by 2030 (EBRD, 2016). A strategy was developed to counteract this increase with a suite of measures, full implementation of which could even have led to a reduction in emissions, not just a return to the pre-fuel switching baseline (EBRD, 2016). However, there is no information available on the progress of this policy.

The Egyptian, and the broader regional cement industry has also been plagued by oversupply for years (Vanderborght et al., 2016). While the strategy mentioned above noted that no new capacity was needed until 2025, a new state-owned facility was opened in 2018, further exacerbating the oversupply issue (EBRD, 2017; Enterprise, 2021b) . The drop in demand in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse.

Around 90% of the sector currently uses coal in at least part of their manufacturing process. Soaring coal prices in 2021 has some considering a switch back to gas, but its prices are also increasing (Enterprise, 2021a).

The Egyptian Waste Management Regulatory Authority is working on regulations that would require cement companies to use alternative fuels and waste materials in their production instead of coal, one of the recommended measures in the 2016 strategy (Enterprise, 2021a).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 30% of Egypt’s total energy consumption. Transport emissions have increased by 75% from 2005 to 2019 (World Bank, 2022). In its NDC, Egypt pledged to reduce emissions in the sector by 7% by 2030.

Fossil gas use in the transport sector is low but expected to increase. In 2020, the Egyptian government announced a nationwide programme to convert over 400,000 cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) by 2023, bringing the total number of cars running on gas to one million. The Central Bank of Egypt is supporting this initiative by providing loans with initial support amounting to nearly USD 1 billion (EIU, 2021). While CNG may be seen as a cleaner alternative to oil-fuelled cars, it is by no means a solution for air pollution. CNG-fuelled cars emit a significant amount of particle pollution—both ultrafine and PM2.5 (Transport & Environment, 2020).

The Egyptian EV market is in its infancy with only a few thousand cars on the road (The National, 2023). High prices, limited charging infrastructure and a challenging regulatory environment, both for the individual driver and the sector are all barriers to growth.

The government plans to subsidise the purchase of locally produced EVs and has set a goal of installing 3,000 charging stations by 2023 (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021). In April 2021, a committee was established by the Ministry for Public Enterprise to look into the location of the charging stations (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021a). Current numbers are difficult to come by; however, one of the leading installers has already built 70 stations with plans to expand to 300 by 2023 (Infinity, 2022).

The Ministry of Military Production, which has significant manufacturing capabilities, is developing an EV industry strategy that seeks to promote local production (New & Renewable Energy Authority, 2020). However, a concrete document has yet to be released. Egypt aims to be a key exporter of EVs by 2040. GM and Mercedes Benz are working with Egyptian partners to explore the possibility of local EV production (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021d). Negotiations between a Chinese automaker and Egyptian entities for local EV production faltered in late 2021, though some prototype testing did occur during the year. State-owned entities have also partner with local manufacturers to produce electric buses (Ministry of Public Business Sector, 2021b, 2021e).

Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain discussed developing the region’s first joint EV manufacturing deal during the Higher Committee of Integrated Partnership meeting held in Cairo in March 2023. The four countries signed several industrial partnerships, including an agreement to build three EV factories across Egypt, Jordan and the UAE (Zawya, 2023).

Importing used cars is banned in Egypt; however, the ban was relaxed in 2018 to allow for the importation of used EVs that are not more than three years old (Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2021).


## Waste

In October 2020, Egypt adopted a new waste management law (Enterprise, 2020a). Effective waste management has been a challenge for the country for the last decade. In September 2021, a public-private partnership was formed to build the first waste-to-energy plant (Green Tech Egypt, 2021b, 2021a). A waste-to-energy feed in tariff to support such projects was adopted in 2019; however, as electricity is currently in oversupply, this measure may do little to support the industry in practice (Enterprise, 2020c; Riad & Riad, 2020).


# Sources


# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC

Egypt’s updated NDC target is expressed as a reduction below a BAU scenario. Egypt’s NDC only provides BAU values for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors. For energy-related CO2 emissions not covered by electricity and transport, we have used a reference scenario from IRENA’s Renewable Energy Outlook report to estimate the BAU values (IRENA, 2018). For other sectors and gases (including the “associated gases” oil & gas sub-sector), we have used a ten-year trend (2006–2015) up to the 2015 baseline year specified in the NDC. As Egypt’s NDC only covers emissions from CO2, CH4 and N20, we have used our current policy projections values for F-gases (instead of estimating a business-as-usual scenario).

We have used the reductions in Egypt’s NDC for the electricity, transport and oil & gas sectors. These reductions represent the upper end of the conditional NDC quantification. For the lower end of the range, we also estimated emissions reductions from the industry and buildings sectors.

Egypt’s NDC refers to the Low-Carbon Roadmap for Egypt’s Cement Sector, which targets a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions from the cement sector (Vanderborght et al., 2016). As cement represents a large share of Egypt’s CO2 emissions in the industry sector, we have assumed this reduction applies to the entire sector and subtracted it from our industry BAU (IRENA’s reference scenario for industry) (IRENA, 2018). For the buildings sector, we have assumed an 8% reduction below IRENA’s reference scenario, in line with the reduction in non-renewable energy use between 2015 and 2030 in IRENA’s enhanced renewable energy (REmap) scenario compared to the reference one in 2030.

Egypt’s NDC uses the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. The CAT expresses emissions in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWPs. For the transport and electricity sectors, we have used the original values from Egypt’s NDC, as most of the emissions in those sectors are from CO2. In 2015, 98% of transport emissions and nearly 100% of emissions from energy industries were from CO2 according to Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report. For the oil & gas sub-sector, we have assumed all emissions are methane, and have converted values from SAR to AR4 GWP.


## Current policy projections

We derive the range of projections under current policies according to the following method:

Lower end of the range: Historical data shows that per capita emissions have been largely stable in the past. We assume that this correlation remains and apply the average per capita emissions to UN population prospects until 2030.

Upper end of the range: We use projections from the IRENA RE Outlook for Egypt for energy related CO2 emissions. For all other emissions, we assume a continued trend of past emissions up to 2030.

We further investigate the impact of the RE targets on emissions. Meeting the target does not decrease emissions of the upper end of the range beyond the lower end. Even when assuming a lower electricity generation growth than in the IRENA reference scenario, the emissions reductions compared to the reference do not lead to lower emissions. We thus assume that the target is covered by our range.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target overview

Egypt submitted its second, updated NDC to the UNFCCC on 26 June 2023, strengthening only its emissions reduction target in the power sector.

Egypt’s NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions reduction target but rather presents emissions reductions to be achieved in the electricity, transport and oil & gas sub-sectors (Government of Egypt, 2023). Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC. The lack of transparency in the NDC makes any assessment of the targets difficult.

The NDC is conditional on Egypt receiving international support. Egypt does not specify whether any portion of the NDC is unconditional.

We estimate Egypt can easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it has already put in place, and it should therefore submit a strengthened target that incentivises additional emission reductions.

Egypt does not have a net-zero emissions target, nor has it submitted a Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC as of July 2023.

* See Assumptions section for a discussion on GWP values.


## NDC updates

Egypt submitted its second updated NDC on 26 June 2023 (Government of Egypt, 2023). This update is exactly the same as the previous, 2022, submission, with the exception of the revised renewable energy target.

Egypt has now committed to achieving 42% of renewable energy in its generation mix by 2030, five years earlier than under the previous NDC. Consequently, Egypt strengthened its emissions reduction target in the power sector by 10 MtCO2e or 14% compared to the previous target. However, since this revised target is the only modification, the overall impact of this NDC update remains minor.

The new NDC target is conditional on international support and Egypt still does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. The CAT estimates Egypt can easily achieve this target – even without international support – and should therefore substantially strengthen it.

The new NDC still does not include an economy-wide emissions target but instead includes emissions reductions to be achieved in the following sub-sectors: electricity, transport and oil & gas.

By 2030, Egypt pledges to the following emissions levels in these sectors:

- Electricity: 134* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 215* MtCO2e)
- Transport: 115* MtCO2e (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 124* MtCO2e)
- Oil & gas production (associated gases sub-sector): 1.1 MtCO2e1 (down from a business-as-usual scenario of 3.1 MtCO2e2)
*NOTE: The figures used in Egypt’s NDC use global warming potential values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We have not converted the values from electricity and transport to AR4 values as CO2 is the dominant gas (see the Assumptions section for further details).

These three sectors accounted for 43% of Egypt’s total GHG emissions3 in 2015, the baseline year. In total, Egypt pledges to reduce emissions by 92 MtCO2e compared to a business-as-usual pathway in these sectors.

The revised target for the electricity sector is more ambitious than the previous one, as Egypt aims to reach it five years earlier and clarifies that it pertains to the share of electricity generation rather than capacity.

Egypt also lists measures for the industry, buildings, tourism and waste sectors but does not commit to specific emissions reductions. The agriculture and land use sectors are excluded from mitigation action in the NDC.

We estimate the conditional NDC target would lead to emissions increasing from around 345 MtCO2 today to 496–512 MtCO2e in 2030. The emissions level resulting from this target is well above what we project Egypt’s emissions trajectory to be with the policies it has implemented. Emissions for the electricity and transport sectors would increase by 52% and 140%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030.

Egypt has not communicated its BAU scenario, making it difficult to quantify the overall emissions level resulting from the NDC. We have estimated a BAU scenario using the values provided for electricity, transport and oil & gas and estimating emissions for the remaining sectors using historical trends. The upper end of our target range is based on the quantified reductions for the three sub-sectors only. For the lower end, we also estimated some of the emissions reductions for the policies and measures proposed for the industry and buildings sector. For more details on our calculations, please refer to the assumptions section.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.

Egypt only has a conditional target. We rate the conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). Egypt does not have an unconditional emissions reduction target. In the absence of a target, we use our estimate for Egypt’s business-as-usual target as its unconditional target.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates Egypt’s conditional target “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s conditional NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

BAU Scenario against fair share

In the absence of an unconditional NDC emissions reduction target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated ‘business as usual’ scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient**”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s (estimated) target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).


# Summary


## Overview

**Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”.**

The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component.

In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors.

While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer.

Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.

To improve its climate action, Egypt could:

- Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target
- Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target
- Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production
- Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy
Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”.** The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions.

Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming.

Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration.

**The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”.** Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies.

To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support.

Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, **the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”.**

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Egypt does not have a net zero target.
