        "\n## Overview\n",
        "**Mexico’s climate policies continue to go backwards, as fossil fuel use is prioritised and climate-related policies and institutions dismantled.** **Mexico’s** **updated 2030 target (NDC),**** submitted in November 2022 results in higher emission levels than the targets from 2016, breaching both agreements under the Paris Agreement and Mexican Law – where governments committed to improve their targets over time. The updated NDC lacks transparency and disguises its lack of ambition by counting forests differently in the base and in the target year. Mexico will meet the unambitious target with already implemented policies as emissions continue to rise through 2030. With this update, the CAT’s rating of Mexico’s climate targets and action worsens from “Highly insufficient” to “Critically insufficient”.**\n",
        "**While the new target includes a larger percentage reduction it still leads to higher emissions. The NDC update increases the percentage reduction of the unconditional target from 22% to 35% (30% with own resources and an additional 5% from agreed international support) by 2030 and from 36% to 40% conditional on additional international support. But the business-as-usual (BAU) baseline, against which the targets are defined, has been revised upwards. In addition Mexico expects a higher contribution of emissions sinks in forests to achieving the target. Together this means that the new target can be met even if emissions excluding those of forestry are higher than what they could have been under the old target.**\n",
        "**The 2022 NDC update replaces the 2020 update, which became invalid after a Mexican court found that it is less ambitious than the very first NDC of 2016 and therefore a violation of continuous progression of ambition. The 2022 update is less specific on the contribution of forestry to the target, which may make it more difficult to argue its ambition.**\n",
        "**Mexico pursues a “gross-net” approach, meaning it counts only emissions** **sources**** in its BAU, ignoring** **sinks**** from land use and forestry. However, the NDC does intend to use these sinks to achieve the target, highlighting that nature-based solutions are ‘central’ to achieving the targets. In 2019, reported sinks were almost 200 MtCO****2****e, or about a quarter of Mexico’s emissions excl. land use, land use change and forestry.** **While technically allowed,** **this accounting approach has been criticised as in-transparent for over 20 years.**\n",
        "**Mexico’s 2022 NDC update removes the target to peak emissions in 2026 and does not mention any net zero nor other long-term targets.**\n",
        "**Mexico’s climate policies under President Lopez Obrador continue to go backwards, as fossil fuel use is prioritised and climate-related policies and institutions dismantled. This puts the country’s emissions pathway even further from the Paris Agreement 1.5°C goal.** **Mexico’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise – despite the brief dip caused by the COVID-19 pandemic – and are projected to continue increasing through 2030. Mexico is on track to achieve its old and new unambitious climate targets in 2030. For Mexico to reverse trends and transition towards a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, it needs to reverse its policies, move away from fossil fuels, foster renewable energy, and tackle the transport sector.**\n",
        "**Instead of investing in renewable energy, Mexico has** **acquired an oil refinery**** in the US and is fast-tracking the construction of another in** **Dos Bocas****, Tabasco. These actions were included in the** **ten ‘climate’ actions**** Mexico is committed to pursuing in the coming years,** **presented by President Lopez Obrador at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate held by President Biden in June 2022.**\n",
        "**Lopez Obrador’s government also continues to** **subsidise the use of fossil fuels**** in the transport sector as a response to the global energy crisis and inflation rates that have stemmed from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. As part of the Federal Budget for** **2021**** and again in** **2022****, over 70% of the budget under ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation effects’ has been allocated to the transport infrastructure of fossil gas.**\n",
        "**Reforms**** to the General Climate Change Law in 2020 eliminated the Climate Change Fund and in 2021, the** **government announced**** the dissolution of the National Institute for Climate Change. The dismantling of climate change governance sends a clear message to Mexicans and the international community that climate change and the environment are simply not a priority in Mexico.**\n",
        "**However, Lopez Obrador’s party lost its** **qualified majority**** in congress in the 2021 elections, enabling its political** **opposition to stop**** the executive’s proposal to reform Mexico’s energy system in April 2022. With this proposed** **reform****, the government intended to limit the participation of private electricity producers and disestablish the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) and the Clean Energy Certificates. Prior to the vote against the energy reform, a massive civil society protest movement created a public debate on the implications of the proposal—sending a clear message to the government that Mexicans are concerned about climate change and their future.**\n",
        "The CAT rates Mexico’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with any interpretation of a fair-share contribution and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "Mexico’s overall rating has worsened since the last update as our estimations of the updated climate commitments show significantly higher emission limits in 2030 that are not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The 2022 NDC update provides an updated, increased BAU baseline, and provides lack of transparency regarding the sectoral contributions towards achieving the targets – particularly that of the forestry sector.\n",
        "We rate Mexico’s policies and actions as “Highly insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling emissions and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
        "Under the government of President Lopez Obrador Mexico’s climate policies have gone backwards—largely because it continues to choose policies that prioritise the use of fossil fuels under the discourse of energy sovereignty and republican austerity. Since Lopez Obrador’s election in 2018, several policies supporting renewable energy and climate change in general have been rolled backed or reformed. In January 2019, the Mexican government cancelled long term electricity auctions – instruments that had incentivised an increase in renewable energy for electricity production in Mexico over three years – and reverted a former government decision to retire the oldest and dirtiest electricity fossil-fuel power plants.\n",
        "In 2020, the Mexican Ministry of Energy published a bill that would effectively halt private renewable energy investment in the country, prioritising the government's own ageing, fossil fuel-fired power plants. More recently, the government allocated most of the ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation’ budget in 2021 and 2022 to fossil gas transport infrastructure. It is building an oil refinery in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, has acquired one in Texas, US, and continues to subsidise the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector.\n",
        "Since 2013, Mexico has continued to report its historical emissions at much higher levels than the already high emissions projections under the NDC baseline submitted in 2016. Emissions from the energy sector increased by 34% between 1990 and 2019. This sector alone was responsible for nearly two thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions in Mexico in 2019 (aside from the forestry sector). Nearly a third of projected emissions are expected from the transport sector in 2030.\n",
        "In December 2021, a new version of the Special Climate Change Program (PECC, in Spanish) was published, outlining objectives, strategies, actions and goals related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Its Objective 2: “reduce greenhouse gas emissions” lists a number of actions regarding renewable energy, which seem to contradict the rollback of energy policies in recent years. Other actions are focused on increasing efficiency in fossil fuel generation plants or mitigation in oil & gas extraction – contradicting the transformative decarbonisation measures needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal.\n",
        "During his speech at President Biden’s Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in June 2022, President Lopez Obrador presented ten ‘climate’ actions his government is prioritising in the next years. Two of these actions include ramping up fossil fuel production to achieve energy sovereignty by modernising six oil refineries, acquiring one in the US and building a new one in Dos Bocas, and building two new coke plants to be able to domestically transform fuel oil into gasoline.\n",
        "We rate the conditional NDC target of an up to 40% greenhouse gas reduction from a BAU baseline scenario in 2030 as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
        "We have also estimated a range for the contribution of the forestry and land use sector, given the lack of details in the NDC update. See the Assumptions section for more details.\n",
        "We rate Mexico’s 2030 updated NDC target of reducing all greenhouse gas emissions by 30% under a business-as-usual (BAU) baseline scenario in 2030 with own resources as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action.\n",
        "The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to its fair share. Mexico’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "The CAT rates what a country intends to do with its own resources against its fair share. As the updated Mexican NDC specifies within its unconditional target that 5% of the 35% reduction will be achieved through “agreed international support for ‘clean energies1’”, we have considered only 30% reduction from BAU in 2030 as Mexico’s target to be achieved with domestic means.\n",
        "The NDC update includes a BAU baseline that has been revised upwards from the 2016 NDC and is very similar to the (no longer valid) 2020 NDC update. The updated baseline specifies a sectoral breakdown that includes emissions from forestry but excludes forestry removals. In contrast to the 2016 NDC, the 2022 update does not include the expected sectoral contributions to achieve the target. Notably, the gross-net approach for accounting for the contribution of the forestry sector significantly reduces the need for action to achieve the “Critically Insufficient” target: while removals are not included in the baseline, they are mentioned within the text to be ‘central’ to achieving the target.\n",
        "In 2021, after civil society won an ‘amparo’ lawsuit (under the constitution) against the lack of ambition of Mexico’s December 2020 updated NDC, a judge reinstated Mexico’s original 2016 climate targets. The reason for this decision was that Mexico’s updated climate commitments, albeit unchanged in terms of reduction percentages, resulted in a higher emissions level due to an upward revision of the baseline. It also was less transparent than the original and excluded the target of peak emissions in 2026. The court also reinstated the 2050 goal from Mexico’s Mid-Century Strategy.\n",
        "Due to the lack of details on the contribution of the forestry and land use sector in the updated climate targets, we consider a range between assumptions. See the Assumptions section for more details.\n",
        "1Mexico includes electricity generation through fossil gas efficient cogeneration of as part of its definition of ‘clean energies’.\n",
        "The land use, land-use change and forestry has been a stable sink in Mexico over the last 20 years.\n",
        "Notably, the 2022 NDC update considers this sector to be ‘central’ to achieving the updated 2030 climate targets. While emissions from forestry are considered in the BAU baseline and sinks are not, the NDC text mentions sinks from land use and forestry are expected to achieve the target – without specifics on the expected contribution of the sector.\n"

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.\n",
        "\n## Policy overview\n",
        "Under the government of President Lopez Obrador Mexico’s environmental and climate policies have gone backwards, largely because the government continues to prioritise the use of fossil fuels in all spheres of government and deprioritise climate change mitigation under the discourse of energy security and republican austerity.\n",
        "Since Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018, several energy and climate related policies have been rolled back and governance institutions dismantled.\n",
        "Just a month into the new government, In January 2019, it cancelled the ‘long-term electricity auctions’ (Energia Estrategica, 2019). The scheme was introduced in 2015 as one of Mexico’s main instruments to achieve its clean energy targets under the Energy Transition Law and General Climate Change Law. The first three rounds of electricity auctions resulted in 65 new solar and wind power plants and several broken international records for low generation prices (Notimex, 2019).\n",
        "In June 2019, after fast-tracking permitting processes, the construction of the “Dos Bocas” oil refinery in Tabasco began (Fanny Miranda, 2019). This new oil refinery is expected to emit 2.1 MtCO2e per year (K. García, 2020a). Most of the 2019 federal budget allocated to the Federal Electricity Company (CFE, in Spanish) was invested in the “modernisation” of coal, diesel, oil and gas power plants, some of which the previous administration had planned to retire (Secretaría de Gobernación, 2018).\n",
        "In 2020, the government published an energy bill (fast tracked due to COVID-19) that effectively halts private renewable energy investment, prioritising the government's own ageing, fossil-fuel power plants (Government of Mexico, 2020). The government said the pandemic caused a huge drop in electricity demand as factories closed and power feeds from renewable sources would have to be postponed during the pandemic, (incorrectly arguing that the intermittent nature of renewable energy projects would produce oscillation in the electrical system which the National Electrical System could not deal with (Stevenson, 2020).\n",
        "In November of the same year, reforms to the General Climate Change Law eliminated the Climate Change Fund, removing one of the most relevant sources of domestic funding for climate-related measures (Ambiental, 2020).\n",
        "In 2021, over 70% of the Federal budget allocated under ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation effects’ went to the transport of natural gas, a fossil fuel (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, 2020). A similar amount was allocated in 2022 to continue financing the transport of natural gas under the umbrella of ‘climate change efforts’ (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, 2021).\n",
        "In May 2021, the Mexican oil company, PEMEX, acquired an oil refinery in Texas, US (Reuters, 2021).\n",
        "In December 2021, the government confirmed the dissolution of the National Institute for Climate Change (INECC)—a decentralised research institution established in 2012 with the purpose of creating & integrating climate change scientific & technical knowledge to aid decision making and policy development in Mexico (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, 2021). This decision – proposed by Lopez Obrador as an austerity measure – was a direct attack on Mexico’s climate change governance. While its responsibilities and personnel are said to be transferred to the Environment Ministry (SEMARNAT), this change eliminates the decentralised qualifier of the institutions, effectively losing a critical voice against the government.\n",
        "The federal budget approved by the Mexican Congress for 2022 still includes resources for new infrastructure related to fossil fuels, including the construction of the Dos Bocas oil refinery (Secretaría General & Secretaría de Servicios Parlamentarios, 2021).\n",
        "In April 2022, however, opposition legislators stopped the executive’s proposal (from September 2021) to reform Mexico’s energy system (C. García, 2022). With this proposal, the government intended to significantly limit the participation of private electricity producers and eliminate the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) – a regulatory institution – as well as instruments like the Clean Energy Certificates. Prior to the vote, civil society protest sparked a public debate on the implications of the reform—giving a clear message to the government that despite the priorities of the ruling party, Mexicans are concerned about climate change and their future.\n",
        "The decision to favour fossil fuel generation over renewable energy now puts Mexico on a path that is even more inconsistent with the steps it needs to take to achieve the 1.5°C temperature limit. Its plans for the power sector stand in stark contrast to what is required to achieve the 1.5°C limit. Furthermore, the dismantling of climate change governance institutions - that have successfully created scientific knowledge to inform public policy and have at times also criticised the lack of action of the Mexican government – effectively sends a message to the climate community that climate change and the environment are simply not a priority of the current government in Mexico.\n",
        "The basis for climate policy in Mexico is its ‘General Climate Change Law’ (LGCC)—adopted in 2012— which translates the overarching climate targets into strategies and plans, and provides the institutional framework for implementation. This law was one of the first globally, and the first in a developing country. The law does not include concrete political instruments, rendering it impossible to quantify its direct effects. The 2018 reform to this law includes the addition of Mexico’s first NDC sectoral emission reduction targets for transport, electricity generation, buildings, oil & gas, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The fact that the sectoral targets were included in national legislation was, unfortunately, used as an argument against updating and increasing ambition of Mexico’s NDC, as argued by representatives of the Ministry of Environment during public consultations (SEMARNAT, 2020). The law was further reformed in 2020 to remove the Climate Change Fund and is in the process of being reformed again to eliminate the National Climate Change Institute.\n",
        "Part of the institutional framework required by this Climate Change General Law includes the development of a National Strategy on Climate Change, providing long-term planning, and a Special Programme on Climate Change (PECC) for the short-term planning.\n",
        "A new version of the PECC was published in November 2021 (SEMARNAT, 2021). This document includes targets for 2030 to be achieved by the development and implementation of 169 specific actions under four priority objectives (adaptation, mitigation, co-benefits derived from synergies between adaptation and mitigation, and climate governance).\n",
        "Objective 2: “reduce greenhouse gas emissions” lists a number of actions around the energy transition, which seem to be contradictory to the rollback of energy policies in the last few years:\n",
        "- Plan the incorporation of clean energy for electricity generation (action 2.1.1);",
        "- Increase energy efficiency & sustainability for electricity generation (action 2.1.3);",
        "- Modify NOM-163 for light duty vehicles (action 2.2.5); and",
        "- Promote the development of science & technology needed for the energy transition (action 4.5.1);",
        "The document states that Mexico’s vision towards 2030 is to be a leader in the development and implementation of innovative policies to face the climate crisis, including using the renewable energy needed for a low-emissions energy transition. Given the reforms and restructuring of Mexico’s climate policies and institutions, it remains to be seen how and if the targets of the new PECC will be implemented.\n",
        "In 2014, Mexico implemented a carbon tax that was set at approximately at US$3.5/tCO2e differentiated by fuel type (SEMARNAT, 2014). This tax generated about US$263 million in 2019. However, its impact on GHG emission reduction is unclear and, given its low rate, a substantial emission reduction is unlikely. At the end of 2017, the regulation for the use of emission reduction credits for compliance under the carbon tax in Mexico came into force. This regulation establishes the allowance of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs)—from CDM projects in Mexico—as well as Green Certified Emission Reductions—in the EU ETS—as payment means under the carbon tax (REGLAS de Carácter General Para El Pago Opcional Del Impuesto Especial Sobre Producción y Servicios a Los Combustibles Fósiles Mediante La Entrega de Los Bonos de Carbono., 2017; World Bank Group and Ecofys, 2018).\n",
        "In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The General Climate Change Law was amended later that year – and approved in 2018 by the Mexican Senate – to make the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes. The preliminary regulations for the Mexican ETS were published in October 2019 followed by the start of the pilot phase in January 2020, 1.5 years later than originally planned (SEMARNAT, 2019b). The third year (2022) was established as the transition period between the pilot and ‘operative’ phases.\n",
        "The regulations indicate that the emissions cap for each of the periods of the trial phase (one per calendar year) is determined based on the reported historical emissions of participants and Mexico’s NDC (SEMARNAT, 2019b). Defining the ETS cap on historical emissions puts the programme at risk of not achieving substantial emissions reductions. The cap should instead be set based on ambitious international climate commitments that are in line with the Paris Agreement goal.\n",
        "The ETS will not replace the existing carbon tax.\n",
        "Emissions in Mexico have continuously increased since 1990. Total emissions excluding the forestry sector grew around 37% between 1990 and 2019 (INECC, 2021b). The largest contributor to total emissions is the energy sector, which accounted for nearly two thirds of total emissions excluding the forestry sector in 2019. Most emissions in 2019 stem from the use of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2019 the sectors where emissions grew the most were waste (71% increase) and industrial product and product use (IPPU, with 56% increase).\n",
        "It is worth noting that as of 2013, historical emissions as reported by the inventory are higher than the already high emissions projections under the NDC BAU baseline. Because of methodological changes in the latest inventory such as updating to the latest 2019 refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, estimations of emissions for the industry sector (electronic industry and its subcategories), the forestry sector (now based on satellite monitoring data), the agriculture sector (enteric fermentation and fertiliser use), and the transport sector (for light vehicles) (INECC, 2021c).\n",
        "We estimate that Mexico’s emissions under current policies will increase towards the end of the decade, climbing to up to 807-831 MtCO2e in 2030, excluding LULUCF. These projections account for a decrease in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
        "We estimated a range based on the likelihood of implementation of major policies in the electricity, transport and buildings sectors (see the Assumptions section for more details). The upper end assumes that the mitigation potential outlined in the latest electricity planning will not be achieved, whereas the lower end considers the potential as presented in “PRODESEN 2021-2034” (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, 2021). We have assumed the range given the government’s prioritisation of fossil fuels and the rollback of policies supporting renewable electricity generation. Our analysis suggests that Mexico will need to implement additional policies to meet its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030.\n",
        "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
        "- **Methane pledge:** Mexico signed the methane pledge at COP26. Methane was responsible of over a fourth of Mexico’s GHG emissions in 2019 (INECC, 2021b). Nearly 60% of those emissions stem from enteric fermentation in the agriculture sector, followed by the waste sector with nearly 30% and then the energy sector with around 10%. However, recent research indicates that methane emissions from oil and gas production are underreported in Mexico’s inventory (see Energy section below). In its 2016 NDC, Mexico outlines 30 measures to achieve its unconditional 2030 NDC target. Four are directly linked to reducing methane emissions (INECC, 2018a; Muñozcano, n.d.); two in the oil and gas sector, one in the agriculture sector, and one in the waste sector (see sectors below for more information). Achieving the pledge of a 30% reduction in all sectors (assuming all countries should reduce equally) would translate to reducing around 47 MtCO2e per year (based on emissions from 2019) and would likely require additional measures as those outlined in Mexico’s 2016 NDC. Aside from signing the Methane pledge, Mexico is also part of the Global Methane Initiative (GMI), the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) and the North American Climate, Clean Energy and Environment Alliance. In June 2022, President Lopez Obrador included the goal to invest 2 billion USD to reduce methane emissions from oil & gas exploration (Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores, 2022).",
        "- **Forestry:** Mexico signed the forestry pledge at COP26. In its NDC, Mexico outlines mitigation measures for the forestry, the first of those being ‘to reach zero deforestation by 2030 through its National REDD+ Strategy’. The government estimates the mitigation potential from achieving zero deforestation from 157,000 ha (in 2015) and sustainably manage forests as 46 MtCO2e in 2030 in its 2016 NDC (INECC, 2018b).",
        "\n## Energy\n",
        "Mexican greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector have increased by 34% between 1990 and 2019 (INECC, 2021b). This sector alone was responsible for nearly two thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions in Mexico in 2019 (excl. the forestry sector).\n",
        "Despite the increasing emissions, Mexico’s government continues to go backwards on climate by favouring fossil fuels over renewable energy generation. This includes the cancellation of successful policy instruments that led to the construction 65 new solar and wind power plants, construction of a new oil refinery in the State of Tabasco, the purchase of another in the US, the prioritisation of supply from fossil fuel generation over renewables, and federal budget allocation to the “modernisation” of coal, diesel, gas and oil-fuelled power plants—some of which the previous administration had already scheduled for retirement (Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, 2021a; Reuters, 2021; Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, 2021; SENER, 2018).\n",
        "The decision to favour fossil fuel generation over renewable energy now puts Mexico on a path that is even more inconsistent with the steps it needs to take to achieve the 1.5°C temperature limit. Its plans for the power sector stand in stark contrast to what is required to achieve the 1.5°C limit. The Mexican government’s decisions also bring into question whether it will achieve its clean energy targets under the 2015 Energy Transition Law (LTE, in Spanish) , and General Climate Change Law: 25% of electricity generation in 2018, 30% in 2021, and 35% in 2024 (Ley de Transición Energética, 2015).\n",
        "With 23.2% of clean generation, the LTE’s 2018 goal of 25% was not achieved (SENER, 2020). In its second trimestral report of 2021, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE, in Spanish) estimated that Mexico will get to 29.8% clean energy, far from the 2024 goal of 35% (COFECE, 2021). A 2021 Presidential Decree reforming the Electric Industry Law (LIE, in Spanish) that prioritises electricity supply from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE, in Spanish) over other participants (i.e. private renewable energy electricity producers) will most likely increase this gap (Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, 2021a).\n",
        "Clean energy according to Mexican law includes renewable energy sources, nuclear power, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) as well as efficient fossil gas cogeneration (Ley de La Industria Eléctrica, 2014). A reform proposal to the Energy Transition Law proposed by President Lopez Obrador in 2021 was stopped in Congress in April 2022 (C. García, 2022).\n",
        "With its reform proposal, the government intended to limit the participation of private electricity producers by mandating that the Federal Electricity Commission generates at least 54% of electricity, even though it currently produces electricity at higher marginal costs and emissions than private, renewable generators (Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, 2021b). The reform pretended that electricity dispatch would no longer depend on generation costs but on technology, prioritising the Federal Electricity Commission’s fossil fuel-based plants over wind and solar (SENER, 2022). It also proposed eliminating the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) – a regulating institution – and the Clean Energy Certificates.\n",
        "An analysis by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that implementing the changes included in the proposed reform would lead to increases in electricity production costs; increased consumption of natural gas, fuel oil and, coal; and increased emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx (Bracho et al., 2022).\n",
        "The government has continuously allocated federal money on fossil fuel infrastructure. Most of the 2019 budget allocated to the Federal Electricity Company (CFE, in Spanish) was invested in the ‘modernisation’ of coal, diesel, oil and fossil gas power plants, some of which the previous administration had planned to retire. As part of the Federal Budget for 2021 and again in 2022, over 70% of the budget under ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation effects’ has been allocated to the transport of natural gas (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, 2020, 2021). The Federal budget also allocates a substantial amount of money to build the Dos Bocas oil refinery in Tabasco.\n",
        "In January 2019, Mexico’s government announced the cancellation of the 2018 long-term renewable electricity auction (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, 2019). This auction was intended to assign contracts for the trading of power, cumulative electric energy and clean energy certificates from 2021 onwards, but was suspended end of 2018—this was one of the first decisions after Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018 (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, 2018a, 2018b). The first three rounds of auctions – between 2015 and 2018 – resulted in 65 new wind and solar power plants (SENER, 2018). These electricity auctions also led to record low generation prices. Furthermore, the government is using COVID-19 as a reason to further postpone the integration of renewables into the National Electrical System (Government of Mexico, 2020).\n",
        "Another example of the country’s support of fossil fuels over renewables was the Energy Sectoral Program 2020-2024 (PROSENER), where fossil fuel related funding accounted for 95.7%, in stark contrast with the 1.3% destined for activities towards an energy transition (K. García, 2020a). This policy document was also blocked by the Courts after another lawsuit by Greenpeace, temporarily halting its implementation (K. García, 2020b).\n",
        "In 2019, Mexico ranked as the 11th largest global oil producer (Zavala-Araiza et al., 2021). In its pursuit for energy autonomy, Lopez Obrador’s government has bet on increasing oil & gas production.\n",
        "After fast-tracking the permitting process, the construction of the “Dos Bocas” refinery in Tabasco began in June 2019 (Fanny Miranda, 2019). Then, in early 2021, the state-owned oil company PEMEX took full ownership of an oil refinery in Deer Park, Texas. These projects, together with López Obrador´s policy to foster fossil fuels in Mexico, have been heavily criticised by environmental groups nationally and internationally (Alberto Nájar, 2019).\n",
        "The criticism refers to concerns about climate change – with Mexico’s emissions going in the opposite direction of net zero – and concerns regarding safety, as the “Dos Bocas” refinery location is prone to hurricanes and flooding, as well as impacts on the local environment and population (CEMDA, 2019; Forbes, 2019).\n",
        "In 2021, scientific research of atmospheric observations of Mexico’s onshore and offshore oil and gas production revealed that methane emissions could be significantly under reported in its national inventory (Zavala-Araiza et al., 2021). These emissions stem from inefficient gas flaring. The research reveals that inaccuracies between onshore and offshore vary but can be up to 20 times higher than reported for some production sites. The analysis suggests that the main driver of inaccuracies between observations and the inventory is the use of generic emission factors for flaring – while offshore flaring might be overestimated in the inventory, onshore flaring is much more inefficient.\n",
        "Mexico has been a member of the Global Methane Initiative since 2004 and signed the methane pledge at COP26. It also outlines two methane specific measures related to reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector: measure IV.1: execute the Global Methane Initiative (GMI, member since 2004) with a potential of 9.5 MtCO2e in 2030, and measure IV.2: reducing fugitive emissions through the NAMA—with an estimated emissions potential of 2.8 MtCO2e/year.\n",
        "In 2018, Mexico published a set of guidelines to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industries (Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Industrial y de Protección al Medio Ambiente del Sector Hidrocarburos., 2018). In June 2022 it announced it is spending USD 2bn to reduce methane emissions from oil & gas exploration by 98% (Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores, 2022).\n",
        "\n## Transport\n",
        "Transport emissions in Mexico increased by 36% between 1990 and 2019 (INECC, 2021b). In 2019, transport sector emissions – mostly from fossil fuel burning – reached 148 MtCO2e, equivalent to 21% of total emissions (excl. the forestry sector). Over 90% of transport emissions come from road transport, and emissions in this sector are expected to continue to rise.\n",
        "According to the 2016 NDC BAU baseline, by 2030, the transport sector will have the highest emissions growth (1.5 times higher in 2030 than in 2013) and the highest emissions share (28% of total emissions). Road transport will continue to represent the main source of transport emissions. The national vehicle fleet has gone from 15.6 million in 2000 to over 50 million in 2020 (INEGI, 2022).\n",
        "The transport sector is also one of the main sources of air pollution in Mexican cities and is responsible for around 21,000 premature deaths in Mexico per year and chronic health problems in the population (SEMARNAT, 2017). Mexico presented a National Air Quality strategy in 2017 – a cross-sectoral strategic planning document. Mexico has also established several ProAire programmes to improve air quality in cities and states (SEMARNAT, 2022). Mexico has been working on an electro mobility strategy since 2018 (Ceyrón, 2018).\n",
        "In its 2016 NDC, Mexico commits to unconditionally reduce transport emissions by 18% by 2030 below BAU projections (equivalent to 213 MtCO2e in 2030) (Government of Mexico, 2015). Instead of leading to lower emissions, this target means emissions from transport can still increase by around 55 MtCO2e by 2030 above 2019 levels – leading to worse pollution levels than today. The same document lists specific measures to achieve the targets. For the transport sector, the 2016 NDC lists eight measures focused on fuel efficiency in light and heavy vehicles, and improved public transportation.\n",
        "Mexico was the first Latin American country to establish fuel efficiency standards for light vehicles in 2013 under “NOM-163”. The standards were put in place by 2016, but then halted in 2017—the 2016 values were applied for 2017 and 2018. Its reimplementation is being discussed between the government, social and private sectors since. In 2018, the Environment Ministry published a proposal for the period 2019-2025, which has still not been approved (SEMARNAT, 2018). A study by INECC estimates that not having this NOM in place between 2017 and 2019 led to a cumulative emissions increase of nearly 11 MtCO2, and projects the emissions to further increase by 7 MtCO2 in the period 2020 to 2022 if the standards are not reinstated (Mariscal Jurado et al., 2021).\n",
        "The modification of NOM-163 is outlined as a specific action under the 2021 Special Climate Change Program (PECC, in Spanish) but given the planning document does not provide a specific proposal (SEMARNAT, 2021), its implementation remains to be seen.\n",
        "After a fiscal reform was approved by the Congress in 2014, Mexico established a tax on manufacturers, producers and importers for the sale and import of fossil fuels according to their carbon content (IEPS, in Spanish) (Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, 2014).\n",
        "Since January 2022, the Mexican government has subsidised gasoline and diesel by removing the IEPS tax (Saldívar, 2022). As a result of global increase in fuel prices stemmed from the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, it increased the subsidy to 100% – losing around MXN 70bn (USD 3.5bn) compared to previous years (Expansión, 2022).\n",
        "\n## Land use and Forest\n",
        "The land use, land-use change and forestry have been a stable sink in Mexico over the last 20 years.\n",
        "In its 2016 NDC, Mexico committed to unconditionally reduce GHG emissions from the forestry sector by 144% in 2030 from a BAU baseline (Government of Mexico, 2015). This means emissions going from 32 MtCO2e in 2030 under a baseline scenario, to -14 MtCO2e under the NDC scenario. Unlike the commitments on other sectors, this commitment was not included in the July 2018 reform to the General Climate Change Law (Government of Mexico, 2015).\n",
        "Mexico’s REDD+ National Strategy 2017-2030 (ENAREDD+) established strategic action lines with the aim of promoting continued reduction of LULUCF emissions and achieving 0% net deforestation rate by 2030 (CONAFOR, 2017).\n",
        "From 2020, the ‘Sowing Life Programme’ pays farmers to plant fruit or timber trees on small plots of land to encourage industry in deprived rural areas (Gobierno de Mexico, 2022). Its goal is to plant 1 billion trees. However, its impact is still unclear as planting big swaths of commercial species, sometimes on land that held native forests, can potentially end up increasing deforestation rates (de Haldevang, 2021). Although it was developed as a social programme, the government now refers to it as a strategy against climate change. In June 2022, President Lopez Obrador included the programme as one of the ten ‘climate’ actions presented at President Biden’s Major Economies Forum on Energy and Environment (Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores, 2022).\n",
        "\n## Agriculture\n",
        "Agriculture emissions in Mexico have increased by 20% between 1990 and 2019 (INECC, 2021b). In 2019, emissions in this sector– most of which are methane – reached 133 MtCO2e, equivalent to 18% of total emissions (excl. the forestry sector). These emissions are already much higher than the 2016 NDC baseline, which estimated emissions from agriculture would reach 90 MtCO2e in 2020, and 93 MtCO2e in 2030.\n",
        "In its 2016 NDC, Mexico committed to unconditionally reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector by 144% in 2030 from a BAU baseline (Government of Mexico, 2015). To achieve this goal, Mexico lists three measures: 1. Reduce crop residue burning, 2. install biodigesters (to reduce methane emissions) and 3. substitute synthetic fertilisers with organic. The mitigation potential for these measures has been estimated as 26 MtCO2e for measure 1, 14 MtCO2e for measure 2 and 7 MtCO2e for measure 3 (INECC, 2018b).\n",
        "\n## Waste\n",
        "According to Mexico’s inventory data, emissions from the waste sector have gone from 14 MtCO2e to 49 MtCO2e between 1990 and 2019, making this the sector with the highest emissions increase over this period, at a 71% increase (INECC, 2021b).\n",
        "In its 2016 NDC, Mexico committed to unconditionally reduce GHG emissions from the waste sector by 28% in 2030 from a BAU baseline (Government of Mexico, 2015). This commitment has been added to the General Climate Change Law in its July 2018 reform (Government of Mexico, 2015). To achieve this target, the NDC mentions two measures: 1. Reach zero methane emissions from landfills, and 2. Stop open air waste burning. These measures have been estimated to have a potential mitigation potential of around 15 MtCO2e in 2030 (INECC, 2018b).\n",
        "In November 2021, a legislative proposal for a General Circular Economy Law was approved by the Mexican Senate (Cámara de Senadores del H. Congreso de la Unión, 2021). This law’s main objective is to establish a general regulatory framework for a transition to a circular economy model. It aims to establish that the market value of products, materials and resources are maintained during the economic cycle to reduce waste production. It encourages re-design, recycling, and reutilisation of products in the industry. So far, this law has no direct link to the National Policy on Climate Change (INECC, 2021a).\n"

        "\n## Historical emissions\n",
        "Historical data between 1990 and 2019 is taken from Mexico’s National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases and Compounds (INEGyCEI in Spanish) (INECC, 2021b). Since the 2021 version of the inventory does not provide emissions and removals from forestry between 1990 and 1999, we have used the ones from the previous version of the inventory for that period (INECC, 2018c). For years 2020 and 2021, we estimate emissions based on a sectoral approach. For the energy and industry sectors we assume a correlation between emissions and GDP, and thus apply economic growth forecasts from the IMF (IMF, 2022). For agriculture and waste sectors, we extend the last five years of pre-COVID historic trend.\n",
        "Mexico’s emissions inventory was developed using the IPCC’s 2006 inventory guidelines and its 2019 update and takes Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Since the inventory provides granular information specifying all gases and sectors per year, we were able to convert these to AR4 (Fourth Assessment Report) GWPs by averaging emissions excl. LULUCF for the years 1990- 2019.\n",
        "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
        "The 2022 NDC update specifies that 5% of the 35% unconditional target is to be achieved with already agreed international support for clean energies. We have thus estimated the unconditional target – to be achieved with own resources – as a 30% reduction from BAU in 2030.\n",
        "Due to the lack of a detailed sectoral contribution towards the achievement of the 2022 NDC update – particularly the forestry sector, we have estimated a range of the contributions of this sector based on the emissions and sinks in the BAU baseline and the historical BAU base year (2013):\n",
        "- The lower end of the range is taken directly from the 2022 NDC BAU. This is quite optimistic as it assumes no reduction of the baseline emissions sources under the baseline.",
        "- The upper end is taken form the last inventory (Gobierno de México, 2022; INECC, 2021c). This assumption on the other hand implies no change in both sources and emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry sector from the historical base year used in the BAU. Historically. The LULUCF sector in Mexico has been a stable sink of around 200MtCO2 during the last 20 years.",
        "Our calculations of the emissions level for the NDC targets, excluding LULUCF emissions, is:\n",
        "- Unconditional target: 786-863 MtCO2e in 2030",
        "- Conditional target: 689-766 MtCO2e in 2030",
        "As land use, land use change and forestry emissions are mostly CO2, we have not converted these numbers to AR4 GWPs.\n",
        "We did not harmonise the NDC baseline scenario to the historical emissions pathway as in previous NDC submissions, the NDC target depended directly on the reference scenario included in the NDC (they provided absolute numbers linked to the targeted reduction).\n",
        "We have re-calculated the absolute emissions level of the 2020 NDC using the same assumptions on the contribution of the forestry sector, and thus the numbers in the table vary from previous updates. This leads to even higher emissions than originally estimated for both unconditional and conditional targets. The rating of the unconditional 2020 NDC worsens by one category from “Insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”.\n",
        "Although not specified in the submission, historically, Mexico has reported emissions using Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) which we converted to GWPs of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\n",
        "The 2022 NDC update also includes an adaptation component as well as a target to reduce black carbon (BC) between 51%-70% below BAU. Given that reductions in BC are generally not additional to those in CO2 emissions, we do not quantify the additionality of the BC target (see box below on BC for more details).\n",
        "Mexico’s NDC includes a target to reduce black carbon (BC) emissions, which has substantial co-benefits for human health. However, reductions in black carbon are generally not additional to reductions in CO2 emissions, because large fractions of black-carbon emissions stem from the same emission sources as CO2. Emission reduction policies therefore often reduce CO2 and black carbon simultaneously, and this is already included in calculations of the emissions reductions in greenhouse gases required to hold warming well below 2°C globally, such as the “emissions gap” and “fair share” reductions (see next section on Fair Share).\n",
        "From the climate perspective, however, there is no established scientific method to compare the climate benefits of black-carbon reductions to those of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In the AR5, the IPCC does not provide calculations of GWP for BC comparable to those provided for greenhouse gases, merely noting the inherent difficulties in doing so and limiting itself to just displaying estimates from the pre-AR5 literature. While Mexico’s NDC specify a metric to compare BC with CO2 (GWP of 900), this is based on a single literature source (pre-dating IPCC AR5), which itself notes very large uncertainties of around 100%.\n",
        "The long-term target from Mexico’s Mid-century Strategy (MCS) is not considered as a “net zero target” and thus, is not included in our assessment. In previous analyses we had taken this target directly form the documents, which provides absolute numbers for expected emissions in 2050. As the MCS does not provide further details on the LULUCF share to the target, we assumed 2050 LULUCF emissions will range between the emissions levels in 2030 for \"baseline\" and \"unconditional target\" scenarios from the 2016 NDC.\n",
        "We had converted the reported numbers from AR5 to AR4 GWPs using an average conversion based on the inventory’s granular information on all gases and sectors per year.\n",
        "\n## Policies and action\n",
        "As a starting point for the current policy projections, we took the baseline scenario as reported in the NDC document and the 6th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of Mexico, 2015; SEMARNAT, 2019a). Although projected emissions under this baseline are quite high, we decided to use this time series based on the alarming fact that as of 2013, historical emissions as reported in Mexico’s inventory are higher than those under the NDC baseline. We converted these numbers to AR4 GWPs using an average conversion factor from AR5 to AR4 based on the inventory’s granular information on all gases and sectors per year. For the purpose of our calculations, we harmonised the NDC baseline scenario to the historical emissions pathway to obtain a continuous line until 2030.\n",
        "We also estimated a lower end of the range through sector-by-sector approach. For the energy sector we assume a correlation between emissions and GDP, and thus apply economic growth forecasts from the IMF until 2027 and a trend thereafter until 2030. For industry, agriculture and waste sectors, we use the trend between 2009 and 2019 (before the COVID’19 pandemic) to project emissions until 2030.\n",
        "The 6th National Communication provides a disaggregation of the reference scenario at the sectoral level, as well as the expected mitigation impact of major current policies for electricity, transport and buildings:\n",
        "- Policies included for transport sector: actions included in the Clean Transport Program (namely Training in driving, fuel efficient technologies, fleet renovation)",
        "- Policies included for building sector: policies aiming to reduce fuel and energy use in both commercial and residential buildings",
        "Based on current developments and the government’s roll back of policies that were put in place to support the clean energy targets (e.g. administration’s decision to modernize fossil fuel electricity generation, cancellation of the renewable energy auctions), we estimated a range based on the likelihood of implementation of the potential in the latest electricity planning (PRODESEN 2020-2034) (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, 2021). The upper end assumes that Mexico will not achieve its clean electricity targets and the related mitigation potential; while the lower end assumes that they will, the policy’s mitigation impact is taken as reported in the 6th National Communication (SEMARNAT, 2019a). In both cases, we assumed the mitigation potential of transport and buildings policies would be achieved.\n",
        "Emissions mitigation potential from clean energy under Objective 2 are specified in the PECC 2021 until 2034 are inconsistent with other government publications (and refer to planning documents from 2018), and thus not included in our calculations.\n",
        "We converted the expected mitigation impact to AR4 GWPs using the average historical conversion factor from AR5 to AR4. We then deducted these expected mitigation impacts from the respective sectoral reference scenarios for these three sectors and assumed no change compared to the baseline for waste, agriculture, industry and oil & gas sectors.\n",
        "\n## Global Warming Potentials values\n",
        "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
        "\n## Black Carbon\n",
        "We estimate that the net effect of black carbon (BC) emission reductions additional to those resulting as a co-benefit from reductions in CO2 to be negligible. There is no established scientific method to compare the climate benefits of BC reductions to those of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The IPCC has not provided such estimates even in its most recent Fifth Assessment Report. Although Mexico’s NDC does specify a metric to compare with CO2 (GWP of 900), we consider this value to be unsuitable for use in the policy context and the single literature source (Bond et al., 2013) to which the NDC refers, states:\n",
        "- \"… the summed climate forcing of all species for a source category emitting in a particular region (or season) may have a different magnitude than the global average, or even a different sign.”",
        "- “The 100-year global-warming-potential (GWP) value for black carbon is 900 (120 to 1800 range) with all forcing mechanisms included. The large range derives from the uncertainties in the climate forcing for black carbon effects.”",
        "- “Co-emission effects … are not captured by BC metrics presented here…”",
        "- “These and other differences raise questions about the appropriateness of using a single metric to compare black carbon and greenhouse gases.”",
        "The paper in reference estimates that the combined global warming effect of black carbon and its co-emitted species is slightly negative and notes that the “reduction of aerosol concentrations by mitigating BC-rich source categories would be accompanied by small to no changes in short-term climate forcing.”\n",
        "Note: this is not the case for certain other air pollutants (e.g. reductions in sulphate aerosols would lead to warming), so while measures to reduce BC do not generally help to combat climate change, these are highly welcomed as a climate-neutral measure to improve local air quality, thereby reducing health impacts.\n"

      "content": [
        "\n## Target Overview\n",
        "Mexico submitted an updated NDC in November 2022, during COP27. The submission includes an unconditional emissions reduction target from BAU by up to 35% in 2030 for all greenhouse gases – up from a previous 22% emissions reduction target (Gobierno de México, 2022). It specifies that 30% of the reduction is to be achieved with own resources and the additional 5% with already agreed international cooperation and finance for ‘clean energies1’. The NDC update also includes a climate target conditional to international support to reduced up to 40% emissions from BAU in 2030.\n",
        "The NDC update includes 2030 targets only and does not mention updates to the mid-century strategy from 20162, a net zero target, nor any other long-term target. The update also explicitly removes the target to peak emissions in 2026.\n",
        "The 2020 NDC update was revoked in 2021 as the targets were less ambitious and less transparent than the original 2016 NDC (Gobierno de Mexico, 2020; Poder Judicial de la Federación, 2021). Already then, the BAU had been revised upwards and Mexico was using creative accounting in the BAU and target which led to higher absolute emissions levels.\n",
        "The recent NDC update includes a BAU baseline that has been revised upwards in comparison to its 2016 NDC and is very similar to the (no longer valid) 2022 NDC update. This update is also less transparent as it excludes the expected contribution of each sector to the achievement of the targets and it includes emissions but excludes absorptions from forestry for the BAU. Sinks, however, can be counted for achieving the target: this “gross-net” approach means that the targets require less action in other sectors.\n",
        "While the text mentions a number of measures in all sectors, it does not include any of the expected emissions reduction from these measures nor the total expected contribution from each sector.\n",
        "As a consequence of the higher BAU and creative accounting, we estimate that Mexico’s updated 2030 climate targets are less ambitious when expressed as an absolute emissions limit than those submitted in 2016. Despite submitting an NDC update in 2020, it was revoked in 2021 on the grounds of being less ambitious as the original 2016 NDC, breaching the Paris Agreement and Mexican law. We therefore do not compare this update against the 2020 NDC update, instead comparing it against the 2016 NDC. To increase the transparency of the targets, Mexico could opt to present its climate commitments as an absolute emissions limit instead of making them dependent on a shifting baseline scenario.\n",
        "To assess the targets in the absence of sectoral contributions – most prominently the forestry sector – we have calculated the absolute emissions level of the targets as a range where we consider the same level of emissions and sinks of that of the BAU baseline for the lower end and the historical emissions from the BAU baseline, 2013, for the upper end (see figure below). For further details please see the Assumptions section.\n",
        "Based on these assumptions, we estimate Mexico’s proposed unconditional NDC excluding the contribution of the forestry sector as not exceeding 786 – 863 MtCO2e in 2030, and its target conditional on international support as 689 – 766 MtCO2e in the same year. We rate Mexico’s proposed 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action, and its conditional NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.\n",
        "1 Mexico includes electricity generation through fossil gas efficient cogeneration of as part of its definition of ‘clean energies’.2 Mexico’s Mid-century strategy from 2016 outlines the intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 2050 below 2000 levels (Government of Mexico, 2016). We do not consider this as a “net-zero target” and will re-assess our analysis of this target once there is more clarity.\n",
        "Mexico’s NDC includes unconditional and conditional targets to reduce black carbon (BC) emissions, which has substantial co-benefits for human health. However, reductions in black carbon are generally not additional to reductions in CO2 emissions, because large fractions of black-carbon emissions stem from the same emission sources as CO2. Emissions reduction policies therefore often reduce CO2 and black carbon simultaneously, and this is already included in calculations of the emissions reductions in greenhouse gases required to hold warming well below 2°C globally, such as the “emissions gap” and “fair share” reductions.\n",
        "From the climate perspective, however, there is no established scientific method to compare the climate benefits of black-carbon reductions to those of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In the AR5, the IPCC does not provide calculations of GWP for BC comparable to those provided for greenhouse gases, merely noting the inherent difficulties in doing so and limiting itself to just displaying estimates from the pre-AR5 literature. While Mexico’s NDC specifies a metric to compare BC with CO2 (GWP of 900), this is based on a single literature source (pre-dating IPCC AR5), which itself notes the very large uncertainties of around 100%.\n",
        "\n## NDC Updates\n",
        "Mexico has updated its NDC, and proposes to commit to unconditionally reduce its emissions by up to 35% below a BAU baseline scenario by 2030 (30% with its own resources and an additional 5% with agreed international support and cooperation for ‘clean energies’) and up to 40% below the same baseline, conditional on receiving financial, technical and capacity building support (Gobierno de México, 2022).\n",
        "Given that 5% of the unconditional target will be achieved with international support, we have quantified a reduction of 30% below BAU in 2030 as the unconditional target.\n",
        "While at first glance, this update may be seen as an improvement from the 2016 NDC and the 2020 update (where Mexico committed to an unconditional 22% reduction below BAU in 2030 and a 36% reduction conditional to international support), we find the new targets are less ambitious than 2016 when estimating the absolute emissions level without the contribution of the forestry sector in 2030 (the CAT standard).\n",
        "Because the 2020 update was less ambitious and in breach of the Paris Agreement and Mexican law, it was revoked by a judge in 2021 (Poder Judicial de la Federación, 2021). Since the 2020 NDC update is no longer valid in the Mexican context, we compare the 2022 NDC targets to the original 2016 NDC, which was reinstated by a judge in 2021.\n",
        "The updated NDC targets result in a higher absolute emissions level than the 2016 targets, mainly for two reasons:\n",
        "- The BAU baseline has been revised upwards.",
        "- The potential contribution of sinks from LULUCF has substantially increased. In the 2016 NDC, the sink was estimated as 14 MtCO2 in 2030 as part of the target, while the baseline now already states a sink of 158 MtCO2, and the fact that the land-use sector is “central” to the NDC, it can be expected this would further increase under a scenario with policies. The updated NDC does not provide a clear number for the sinks under a target pathway. In comparison, the 2016 NDC included a sectoral breakdown of the expected contributions to achieve the target.",
        "The updated NDC explicitly removes the previous target to peak emissions in 2026. The reason being that it was never binding as it was included under the ‘intended Nationally Determined Contribution’ and that parties agreed afterwards that developing countries would aim to peak as early as possible without specifying the year. It also mentions the COVID-19 pandemic, and that determining an emissions trend will require further analysis to be undertaken during the update of the Long-Term National Strategy.\n",
        "Mexico had submitted in 2020 an NDC update with the same percentage reductions below BAU as the original 2016 NDC, but with a higher BAU baseline and less transparency on the sectoral contributions to the target (Gobierno de Mexico, 2020). Back then, we had estimated the absolute emissions level of the targets as less as higher than previously making the targets less ambitious.\n",
        "In 2021, after civil society won an ‘amparo’ lawsuit (under the constitution) against the lack of ambition of Mexico’s December 2020 updated NDC, a judge reinstated Mexico’s original 2016 climate targets. The reason for this decision was that Mexico’s updated climate commitments, albeit unchanged in terms of reduction percentages, resulted in a higher emissions level due to an upward revision of the baseline. It also was less transparent than the original and excluded the target of peak emissions in 2026. The court also reinstated the 2050 goal from Mexico’s Mid-Century Strategy.\n",
        "Like previous submissions, the 2022 NDC update also includes targets to reduce black carbon by 51% unconditionally below BAU in 2030 and up to 70% conditional on international support in the same year. It also presents an adaptation component.\n",
        "For further details on the calculations, please see the Assumptions section.\n",
        "*We have re-calculated the absolute emissions level of the 2020 NDC using the same assumptions on the contribution of the forestry sector, and thus the numbers in the table vary from previous updates. This leads to even higher emissions than originally estimated for both unconditional and conditional targets. The rating of the unconditional 2020 NDC worsens by one category from “Insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”.\n",
        "- 05.07.2022 Mexico Assessment – court ruling to revoke 2020 NDC update and reinstate 2016 NDC",
        "- 30.12.2020 Mexico’s updated NDC lowers its climate ambition and transparency, contrary to Paris Agreement rules",
        "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
        "The CAT rates Mexico’s conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways as “Highly insufficient” and its unconditional NDC target against fair share as “Critically insufficient”.\n",
        "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
        "We rate Mexico’s conditional 2030 reduction target levels as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Mexico’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Our rating system suggests that Mexico should receive limited international support to get on a 1.5°C compatible pathway.\n",
        "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
        "We rate Mexico’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Mexico’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
