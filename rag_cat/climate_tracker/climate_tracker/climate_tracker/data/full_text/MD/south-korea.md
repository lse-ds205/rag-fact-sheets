# Summary


## Overview

**A change of government in South Korea has seen a shift in climate policies away from the government’s previous target of 100% renewables, which new President Yoon Suk-yeol has stated are “too expensive”. Instead, he has revitalised the nuclear power program, reversing his predecessor’s announced phase-out of nuclear power.**

**South Korea’s climate change mitigation and energy sector planning still lacks the necessary speed and stringency it needs to get onto a pathway compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.**

**The January 2023 10****th**** Basic Electricity Plan passed in January 2023 proposes revising the targets for the country's electricity mix by 2030 and 2036, aiming for more nuclear than previous targets, at the cost of renewable energy, while its targeted share of coal and LNG are similar. While this change has a limited effect on 2030 emission levels, the deprioritisation of renewable energy hampers a transition towards a 1.5°C pathway. To be Paris Agreement-compatible, coal needs to be phased-out by 2030 at the latest, and gas phased out from the power sector shortly after.**

**In 2021, the share of coal-fired power generation further decreased to 35%, from above 40% over the last decade and from 36% in 2020. The use of renewable energy only increased slightly; more notable is an increase in fossil gas-based electricity production, at 31% of electricity. Nuclear electricity generation decreased slightly in the same year.**

**South Korea’s December 2021 NDC sets an emissions reduction target of 40% below 2018 levels by 2030, a significant improvement on the previous NDC of 24.4% below 2017 levels, but does not improve the overall CAT rating of “Highly insufficient”. Deducting the suggested contribution of forestry and reductions overseas, the target translates into a 32% reduction of domestic emissions by 2030, compared to 2018. To meet the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit, the CAT estimates that a domestic emissions reduction of at least 59% by 2030 is needed.**

**After taking office on May 2022,** **South Korea’s new government is continuing its efforts to advance the implementation of its carbon neutrality target, evaluated as “average” by the CAT. The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth enshrines carbon-neutrality by 2050 into law. Following the Framework Act, in October 2021 South Korea released sectoral roadmaps with possible policy measures. If those roadmaps were implemented, they would also lead to emissions reductions before 2030 and decrease the CAT projections under policies and action.**

The CAT rates South Korea’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The domestic component of South Korea’s 2030 target is rated “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries pursued this level of ambition, it would lead to up to 3°C of warming. To achieve its target, South Korea would need to enhance its policies and action, which are rated “Highly insufficient” and are currently only compatible with up to 4°C of warming compared to modelled domestic pathways.

We rate South Korea’s NDC target including the emissions reductions abroad as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. South Korea should also significantly increase the domestic component of its emissions reduction target, to get on a 1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible pathway.

We rate South Korea’s policies and action as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In March 2023, the Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth released its first basic plan. 2030’s sectoral emission reduction target of the NDC was changed but the overall reduction target remains the same. The plan marks growing reliance on overseas reduction (from 33.5 Mt to 37.5 Mt), various hydrogen (from 7.6 to 8.4 Mt) and CCUS (10.3 to 11.2 Mt). The industrial sector reduction target was reduced to 11%, which previously set at 14.5% in 2021 (37.9 Mt to 29.8 Mt) (MOE, 2023).

In January 2023, the government passed its Tenth Electricity Plan, which aims to increase the renewable electricity share to 21.6% by 2030, up from around 6% in 2020 (IEA, 2021c), while nuclear power would rise to 32.8%, and coal would drop to 21.2% (MOTIE, 2022b). South Korea’s current share of renewables in its power mix is the lowest in the OECD (Schneider et al., 2022a).

Compared to previous plans, the Tenth Electricity Plan aims for a slower growth of renewable energy, and instead priorities nuclear energy. The government plans to extend the lifetime of ten nuclear power plants by 2030 (MOLIT, 2022). Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs (compared to alternatives such as renewables), long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, and its vulnerability to heat waves.

The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is the main policy instrument for promoting renewable energy in South Korea. The RPS scheme mandates major electricity utilities to increase renewable and “new energy” share of the electricity mix to 10% by 2030 (Korea New and Renewable Energy Center, 2019). However, the new tenth electricity plan will include lowering the RPS ratio to 13% in 2023 (previously set at 14.5%) and to gradually increase it to 15% and 25% in 2026 and 2030 respectively (Renewables Now, 2023).

The revised Renewable Energy Act, passed in March 2021, raised the share of renewables at 25% by 2034. This law will support South Korea in achieving its renewable energy targets, however this is still insufficient to put the country on a 1.5°C compatible pathway (Renewables Now, 2023).

The new government has announced its intention to shut down 20 coal power plants by 2030 through the carbon neutral green growth vision and promotion strategy, but also plans to convert 26 coal-fired power plants (13.7 GW) to run on gas (LNG). Furthermore, additional five LNG power plants will be running, to secure 4.3 GW.

In 2021, MOTIE stated that hydrogen and ammonia will play an integral role in achieving South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality target. The government sets 13.8-21.5% country’s electricity generation to be sourced from hydrogen and ammonia-fueled turbines by 2050, replacing power generation from coal and LNG. The government estimated to finalise 50% of 150 MW class hydrogen co-firing test by 2028 while demonstration of 20% ammonia co-firing will be completed by 2027.

In April 2021 at the U.S. Leaders’ Summit on Climate, South Korea announced it will immediately stop financing coal projects abroad (Wang et al., 2021). However, just one month later, it announced exceptions for retrofitting, CCS, and approved projects. Despite this backpedaling, major Korean financial groups like KB, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, have all announced plans to make their investment portfolios carbon neutral by 2050. According to SFOC’s (Solution for Our Climate, 2022) analysis, 70 out of the top 100 South Korean financial institutions have announced they will phase out coal, yet just only a fraction of them have set up actual policies; showing there is still much work to be done around such investment decisions.

South Korea joined the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to reduce methane emissions by 30% below 2018 levels (Climate & Clean Air Coalition, 2022). Joining the Global Methane Pledge, South Korea announced a methane reduction plan that included a national target to reduce emissions from 28 MtCO2e 2018 to 19.7 MtCO2e in 2030, a 30% reduction (IEA, 2022). If implemented, this would be a reduction of about 10 MtCO2e in 2030 below the CAT projections for policies and action.

In 2020, South Korea had announced to increase the coverage of the Korea Energy Trading System (K-ETS) from 68% of national GHG emissions to 73.5%. As a result, almost 80% of CO2 emissions from energy use in 2021 were covered.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate the domestic component of South Korea’s NDC target for 2030 as “Insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s domestic target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We rate South Korea’s overall NDC target (including the domestic and the international element) as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s fair share target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The CAT rates the full target, including South Korea’s proposed procurement of carbon credits from other countries, as “Highly Insufficient” when compared to South Korea’s fair share. This assessment of South Korea’s target does not, at present, question the quality of the credits procured from abroad, and we were unable to identify sufficient information to examine this element of its NDC. As such our analysis may overestimate the mitigation impact of South Korea’s target.

We evaluate the net zero target as “Average”. The target is enshrined in law through the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth, which was passed in August 2021 and enforced in March 2022.

Over the course of 2022, the government has further advanced the enforcement of the legal framework around the target and has taken steps towards more detailed sectoral planning in the form of the Carbon Neutral Green Growth Vision and Implementation Strategy. The strategy includes launching of the 2050 Carbon Neutral Green Growth Committee and the carbon-neutral green growth promotion strategies; (responsible carbon neutrality, innovation, cooperation and adaptation), and technology innovation strategies; (R&D investment system, carbon neutral technological by private sector, institutional support) which aim to achieve the 2030 NDC and the 2050 carbon neutrality target. The net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, it lacks clarity on emissions coverage and detail in the government’s review process.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

The South Korean government included its commitment of carbon neutrality by 2050 in its updated NDC and Long-Term Strategy (LTS) (Republic of Korea, 2020, 2021b). The carbon neutrality target is enshrined in law through the Carbon Neutrality Act, which was passed in August 2021 (Ministry of Environment, 2021) and enforced in March 2022 (Ministry of Environment, 2022b).

In October 2021, South Korea published two draft pathways to net zero emissions in 2050 – the 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios (Republic of Korea, 2021c). Improving on the LTS, the 2050 pathways explicitly state that the net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, South Korea is still not explicit in its coverage of GHGs, and the target review process lacks detail.

The two scenarios phase out coal before 2050, although the exact phase-out year remains unclear. One of the scenarios also phases out natural gas. The other one allows for some natural gas, and has a higher amount of CCUS in turn to compensate the emissions. Both scenarios assume a sink of about 25 MtCO2e from forestry in 2050.

South Korea has progressed the legal implementation of the carbon neutrality target, and the CAT now evaluates the “comprehensive planning” as a given. Nevertheless, the government still has not made the emissions coverage explicit, a prerequisite for an overall evaluation of “acceptable”.

## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – South Korea aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – South Korea provides no explicit information on the target’s emissions coverage. South Korea aims to achieve ‘carbon neutrality’ by 2050 – a term which typically means net zero CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2018). However, in its LTS and 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios, the government lists methane reduction measures and presents targets in units of CO2 equivalents (MtCO2e). The Korean Government would need to be explicit about the emissions coverage for the rating of this element to change. For the quantification of the 2050 target value CAT assumes a coverage of all gases (see assumptions section).
- **International aviation and shipping** – South Korea provide no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios, published in October 2021, state that its net zero target does not include overseas emissions reductions (Republic of Korea, 2021c).
- **Legal status** – The carbon neutrality target is included in South Korea’s LTS (Republic of Korea, 2020) and has been enshrined in law through Carbon Neutrality Act (Ministry of Environment, 2021) and enforced in March 2022 (Ministry of Environment, 2022b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – South Korea’s draft 2050 net zero pathways plan for a LULUCF sink of 25.3 MtCO2e in 2050. The document lists strengthening forest circulation management and expanding afforestation and reforestation but does not reference any specific plans. Earlier in 2021, the Korea Forest Service announced a reforestation plan that could lead to a removal of 34 million tonnes CO2 (Republic of Korea, 2021d). The plan, which aims to log and replant over 70% of South Korea’s mature forests, received a lot of criticism as it is based on a new definition of “old trees” and contested research on the lifetime carbon absorption of trees (Bang-Hyun & Kim, 2021; KFEM, 2021; Macdonald, 2021). Activists also comment that the estimate of 34 million tonnes CO2 removal is highly inflated (KFEM, 2021).
- **Review process** – In its LTS, South Korea states that it will regularly review and update its carbon neutral strategy (Republic of Korea, 2020). The Carbon Neutrality Act states that sectoral strategies will be reviewed every five years and that the implementation of the strategy and targets will be assessed. However, the Act does not provide more specific information on this review process.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios illustrates two different scenarios to reach carbon neutrality, in which it shows the contribution from different sectors, incl. carbon dioxide removals separately. Both scenarios include sinks from LULUCF, one scenario an additional removal through Direct Air Capture (DAC). The plan outlines South Korea’s strategy for achieving these removal and states that forthcoming carbon pricing policy will be a key policy instrument to facilitate reductions across all sectors.
- **Comprehensive planning**–South Korea’s updated NDC, submitted in December 2021, sets an interim target to reduce emissions by 40% below 2018 levels by 2030 which includes reductions from LULUCF and international credits. The target is a significant improvement on the NDC submitted in December 2020 and it covers the same sector as South Korea’s carbon neutrality target.The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth, effective since March 2022, imposes legal procedures and policy measures to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 (Ministry of Environment, 2022b). The implementation mechanism will be based on a national carbon neutrality master plan, which has a planning period of 20 years (revised every five years), and aligned with that regions will prepare climate plans every ten years.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The Korean government has not explained why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C.
The 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios explicitly mention the need for a fair and just transition to a carbon-neutral society. The document also states that revenues from the forthcoming carbon tax will be used to support vulnerable communities in this transition.


## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

South Korea has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

We rate South Korea’s policies and action as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The CAT projected that South Korea’s implemented policies will lead to an emissions level of 650-658 MtCO2e/year in 2030 (1% to 3% relative to 2020 levels, or 116% to 118% above 1990 levels) depending on the eventual impact of the COVID-19 crisis, excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).

After the 2022 elections, the new administration has further pursued the implementation of the carbon neutrality goal: South Korea’s climate neutrality target is enshrined in law through the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth (Carbon Neutrality Act), which was passed in August 2021, enacted in early 2022 and supported through additional legislation and coordination efforts in October 2022.

To support the carbon neutrality goal, the Act for example introduces a climate impact assessment of major national plans and development projects. Emission reductions targets will now be integrated into national budget planning through the climate-responsive budgeting program. The Act also sets up a climate response fund, which will be used to support the structural transformation of carbon-intense industries.

With the newly passed 10th Basic Electricity Plan, the new government has changed the direction of the electricity sector, favoring nuclear over renewable energy (see more detail in the energy sector section below).

South Korea has joined the Global Methane Pledge and targets reductions of 28.6%, 20.9% and 46.5% from energy, agriculture and waste sectors respectively which in total targeted to reduce 30% methane emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, 2021). This means a reduction of about 10 MtCO2e in 2030 below the CAT projections for policies and action.

In 2022, the South Korean government has contributed to several climate finance and investment programmes such as the Carbon neutrality programme (P4G) with USD 4m. The government also pledged to establish the Green New Deal Trust Fund (GNDTF) in GGGI for supporting low and middle-income countries, with a total planned contribution of roughly KRW 6bn – or USD 4.5m. In 2021, the South Korean government committed to supporting the Green Climate Fund in providing a total of USD 30.3 billion for climate projects in partner countries for their climate change response.


## Policy overview

Between 1990 and 2020, South Korea’s GHG emissions more than doubled. Emissions steeply increased in the early 1990s, with growth then continuing at a slower pace. The CAT projections for current policies show emission ns decreasing from 2020, leading to an emissions level of 650-658 MtCO2e/year in 2030. In absolute terms, the CAT estimates that South Korea’s updated NDC translates to 501 MtCO2e/year excluding reductions from LULUCF and international credits. To meet the targets set by the new NDC and climate neutrality law, South Korea needs to significantly strengthen its climate policies.

One of the main cross-sectoral policy instruments implemented to date is the Korea Emissions Trading Scheme launched in 2015 (ICAP, 2019). Phase III (2021-2025) of the ETS was announced in September 2020 and increases the scope from 68% to 73.5% of national GHG emissions, covering 685 companies in 69 subsectors, including steel, cement, petrochemicals, refinery, power, buildings, waste, and aviation (Ministry of Environment, 2021).

The ETS system includes both direct and indirect emissions (emissions from electricity use). The allowable share of offsets for an entity’s compliance obligations decreases from 10% to 5%, while the share of auctioning for 41 of the 69 covered sub-sectors will increase from 3% to 10%, in comparison to the previous phase. The remaining sub-sectors receive 100% free allocation, determined by an assessment of carbon leakage.

The increased shared of auctioning, however, remains low compared to the EU ETS, which in Phase IV auctions 57% of allowances (Serre et al., 2015). In 2021, the ETS permit price covered 79.6% of CO2 emissions from energy use. In total, 96.5% of CO2 emissions from energy use in Korea were priced in 2021, unchanged since 2018. Fuel excise taxes, an implicit form of carbon pricing, covered 65.8% of emissions in 2021, unchanged since 2018 (OECD, 2021).

The 2020 Green New Deal commits around USD 31 billion to green remodeling, green energy, and eco-friendly vehicles (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2020). By 2025 the Green New Deal will target 42.7 GW of renewable power capacity, 1.13 million electric cars, 200,000 hydrogen cars, and the scrapping of 2.2 million old diesel cars. The final deal did not introduce the carbon tax, however, this is mentioned as a planned policy in South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios, published in October 2021 (Republic of Korea, 2021a). According to the Green New Deal, the government will invest KRW 73.4tn or USD 56.6bn (KRW 42.7tn or USD 33 billion from the Treasury). With the aim of strengthening climate action and realising a green economy, investments will focus on green infrastructures, renewable energy, and fostering green industry (IEA, 2021b).

The Hydrogen Roadmap, published in 2019, sets targets for hydrogen in the transportation and energy sectors: 2.9 million hydrogen vehicles by 2040 and 15 GW of power generating capacity from fuel cells (MOTIE, 2019b). South Korea’s current hydrogen demand of 13,000 t/year in 2019 is produced from petrochemical industry by-products. Under the Hydrogen Roadmap, the demand will increase to 5.36 million t/year by 2040; the additional demand in the short-term will be met by LNG and therefore will not lead to significant emissions reductions. South Korea is, however, investigating options for producing green hydrogen in the long-term. The new President Yoon Suk-yeol has stated his support for ambitious hydrogen industry as a priority (Korea Times, 2022).


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants.

Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

● **Methane pledge:** South Korea joined the Global Methane Pledge. The government announced specific emissions reduction targets from the agricultural sector, from waste and from energy. South Korea also announced a methane reduction plan that included a national target to reduce emissions from 28MtCO2e in 2018 to 19.7 MtCO2e in 2030, a 30% reduction in line with the Global Methane pledge’s target.

● **Coal exit:** South Korea signed up to the coal exit pledge at COP26. However, it had not agreed to a date to shift away from coal and pledged to significantly eliminate coal from its energy generation by 2050. South Korea has started its path to decommission coal power plants and stop financing coal plants abroad.


## Power sector

South Korea’s power sector policies and plans are far from being compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C temperature limit, under which coal-fired power must be phased out before 2030 and the role of LNG also needs to decrease. In 2024, coal and nuclear power both accounted for 30% of electricity generation, followed by fossil gas (29%), renewables (10%) and oil (1%) (Ember, 2025).

The two framework policies for the energy supply sector were the Third Energy Master Plan adopted in June 2019 for the period up to 2040 (MOTIE, 2019a) and the Ninth 15-year Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand (Ninth Electricity Plan) adopted in December 2020 for the period up to 2034 (MOTIE, 2020).

In 2022, newly-elected president Yoon Suk-yeol publicly stated his opposition to the renewable energy target 2050. Then, on July 2022, the government released The New Government Energy Policy Direction which replaces the 3rd Energy Master Plan (MOTIE, 2019a), including the nuclear phase-out. It aims to lower the country’s dependence on fossil fuel imports to less than 70% by 2030 and increase nuclear share in the country’s power mix to at least 30% by 2030.

In early 2023, the MOTIE’s General Subcommittee released its “10th Basic Electricity Plan’. To achieve the 10th plan main consideration of “Prioritisation of steady electricity supply for energy security”, South Korea is increasing its nuclear power generation target, and abandoning the nuclear phase-out plan of the previous administration.

Although South Korea signed the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement at COP 26, it will not phase out coal by 2030. South Korea is also increasing its LNG power generation target to produce LNG-based blue hydrogen and ammonia for coal co-firing. The plan is far less ambitious than South Korea’s enhanced NDC in terms of renewable energy power generation. 2030 power generation in South Korea from various policies is shown on the table below (MOTIE, 2022b).

In 2021, the share of coal-fired power generation decreased further to 35%, from above 40% over the last decade and from 36% in 2020. The use of renewable energy only increased slightly. More notable is an increase in gas-based electricity production which produced 31% of electricity. Nuclear electricity generation decreased slightly, but the new government is prioritising the role of nuclear in the future electricity mix and dropping the previously-agreed nuclear phase-out, instead aiming to increase nuclear production. While the share of renewables in the sector has doubled in the last five years, it remains small at around 6%, considerably lower than the EU, Japan, and the US (see Figure below), and far from the 2030 NDC target of 30.2%.

South Korea is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on coal.

Although the share of coal in the power mix has steadily declined in the last five years, falling from 42% in 2019 to 30% in 2024, South Korea continues to expand its coal capacity. A total of 1.1 GW of coal projects remain in the development pipeline (Ember, 2025; Global Energy Monitor, 2025).

The government has committed to phasing out coal from the power sector by 2050 and plans to decommission 26 existing plants or repurpose them to use for LNG. The targeted share of coal in 2030 is 21.2% according to the 10th Basic Electricity Plan, down from 36% today, and lower than previous targets. However, the current phase-out timeline remains unambitious. Advancing the target to 2030 would align South Korea with a 1.5°C compatible pathway.

Research conducted by Climate Analytics suggests that a Paris-compatible decommissioning schedule would require South Korea to retire 4.2 GW of coal capacity each year. Under this scenario, units currently under construction would only operate for four years. These scenarios could halve the number of premature deaths linked to air pollution from South Korean coal plants within the next five years and prevent 18,000 premature deaths in the long-term, when compared to the current 2054 phase-out plan (Ganti et al., 2021).

South Korea confirmed in April 2021 at the U.S. Leaders’ Summit on Climate that it will immediately stop financing coal projects abroad (Wang et al., 2021). Yet, just one month later, the government announced exceptions for retrofitting, CCS, and approved projects (SFOC, 2021). Despite this backpedalling, major Korean financial groups like KB, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, have all announced plans to make their investment portfolios carbon neutral by 2050 (Jee-Hee, 2021).

**Fossil gas**

South Korea is also sending **“Mixed signals”** on fossil gas.

The share of fossil gas in South Korea’s electricity mix has remained stagnant in the last five years, with actual generation largely unchanged. However, the government is currently pursuing a coal-to-gas strategy that will significantly expand fossil gas capacity. In 2024 alone, 1.8 GW of new fossil gas capacity was installed, and a large pipeline of additional projects is currently under development (Ember, 2025; Global Energy Monitor, 2025).

The government aims for gas-fired power generation to make up 20.9% of South Korea’s power mix by 2030. This includes the plan to shut down 26 existing coal power plants (13.7 GW) and repurpose the sites for fossil gas-fired generation using imported LNG. Additionally, the government plans to build five new fossil gas plants, that are expected to add 4.3 GW of installed capacity. However, to remain on a pathway compatible to the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit, South Korea must phase out gas by 2035.

MOTIE also plans to produce hydrogen and ammonia power in their existing coal and LNG generators as part of their coal phase-out strategy. The government targeted commercialising at least 30% hydrogen co-firing by 2035 and a total burning by 2040. The government also plans to apply 20% ammonia co-firing power generation over more than half existing coal power plants (total 45 units) by 2030.

The ongoing fossil fuel investment and increasing fuel prices has led KEPCO (South Korean state-owned electricity provider; Korea Electric Power Corporation) to expose itself to financial risk. It is reported that KEPCO experienced operating losses of roughly USD5bn for the financial year ended 2021, USD 6bn and 5bn for Q1 and Q2 2022 respectively (IEEFA, 2022).

South Korea is making **“Slow Progress”** in deploying renewables.

The share of renewables in the power mix has gradually increased in the last five years, rising from 6% in 2019 to 10% in 2024. South Korea continues to expand its renewable capacity, adding an average of 3.8 GW of wind and solar to the grid each year over this period (Ember, 2025; Global Energy Monitor, 2025).

However, the outlook for future deployment remains uncertain, as President Yoon Suk-yeol decided to drop South Korea’s 100% renewables target, and reversed his predecessor’s denuclearisation policy (2017-2022), claiming that renewables are “too expensive”. However, there is no evidence to support that nuclear is cheaper than renewable energy (see section below).

Research from Climate Analytics suggests that an accelerated, Paris-compatible, coal-to-renewables transition could lead to almost a threefold increase in jobs when compared to the 2054 phase-out plan (Zimmer et al., 2021). In the scenario presented, job losses related to the coal phase-out would be outweighed by newly created jobs in the construction, installation, operation and maintenance of renewable energy and energy storage infrastructure, which amount to 63,000 additional jobs by 2025 and up to 92,000 in 2030.

The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) replaced the feed-in tariff scheme in 2012 and is the main policy instrument to promote renewable energy. The RPS scheme requires major electricity utilities to increase their renewable and “new energy” share in the electricity mix to 10% by 2023 (Korea New and Renewable Energy Center, 2019). The revised Renewable Energy Act, passed in March 2021, raised the threshold to 25% by 2034. This law was effective from October 2021 and will support South Korea in achieving its renewable energy targets.

Recent studies suggest that South Korea can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through establishing an interim renewable target of at least 53% by 2030, to grow into 84% by 2050; and ensuring coal is phased out by 2035, and natural gas power plants by 2045 (GESI et al., 2022).

Expanding nuclear energy remains a pillar of South Korea’s decarbonisation strategy, accounting for 30% of power mix in 2024 (Ember, 2025). As mentioned above, President Yoon Suk-yeol reversed his predecessor’s denuclearisation policy (2017-2022), claiming that renewables are “too expensive”. However, there is no evidence to support that nuclear is cheaper than renewable energy. Nuclear power remains the most expensive form of energy to construct and deploy, despite having significantly lower system costs than intermittent renewables (World Nuclear Association, 2022).

According to a study using Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), solar and wind energy will cost around USD 40 per megawatt-hour, whereas nuclear will reach ca. USD175 per megawatt-hour (LAZARD, 2020). Due to high cost and lengthy construction process, increase in nuclear share is viewed as not strategic given the urgency of the climate issue (Reuters, 2019; Schneider M et al., 2019).

Under former President Moon’s government, the proportion of nuclear energy in the 2030 electricity mix declined from almost 30% to 26.5% (The Diplomat, 2022). In contrast, the new administration just released its “10th Basic Electricity Plan’, projecting the share of nuclear to increase to 32.8% (MOTIE, 2023). President Yoon and his administration committed KRW 1,000 billion (USD 725m) for growing the nuclear industry by 2025 (Schneider et al., 2022b).

Aiming to revitalise South Korea’s nuclear industry, MOTIE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Government-owned Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), Doosan Enerbility and nuclear energy equipment and materials manufacturers to further encourage the nuclear industry to achieve carbon neutrality and power security (MOTIE, 2022). MoE intended listing nuclear power in the K-taxonomy, also aligning its implementation to EU’s nuclear safety guidelines to attract green investment (Ministry of Environment, 2022a).

The focus on nuclear production endangers a fast transition for renewable energy in South Korea, Studies showed that it is feasible for South Korea to increase its renewable energy target from 20.8% in 2030 to more than 50% in 2030, particularly given a number of studies demonstrate that South Korea could achieve high shares of renewable energy, including reaching close to 100% by 2050 (Climate Analytics, 2020; C.-S. Hong, 2019; GESI et al, 2022).

The roadmap for the hydrogen economy, published in January 2019 (MOTIE, 2019b) sets a goal of power generating capacity from fuel cells from 308 MW in 2018 to 15 GW by 2040. In 2020, South Korea introduced a hydrogen law (the Hydrogen Act) aiming to develop a hydrogen economy and expand public access to alternative fuel. South Korea’s hydrogen demand – at 13,000 t/year in 2019 – is produced from petrochemical industry by-products. Under the Hydrogen Roadmap, the demand will increase to 5.36 million t/year by 2040, and the additional demand in the short term will be met by LNG, so will not lead to significant emission reductions.

However, South Korea is investigating options for producing green hydrogen in the long term. In May 2022, South Korea created a Clean Hydrogen Portfolio Standard (CHPS), a mandatory renewable energy supply system using hydrogen under the Hydrogen Act (2020) by excluding hydrogen energy and fuel cells from the scope of the current RPS scheme. The Hydrogen Act sets out a grade-based certification system for clean hydrogen. It also requires operators of hydrogen fuel supply facilities to list a minimum percentage of clean hydrogen on the product. The government has announced its intention to establish a clean hydrogen supply chain and is competing to nurture a world-leading hydrogen industry (MOTIE, 2023).


## Industry

The industry sector accounted for 7.5% of national CO2 emissions (Enerdata, 2022). The main policy regulating industrial emissions is the K-ETS (Korea’s Emissions Trading Scheme), which in Phase 3 (2021-2025) covers 73.5% of national GHG emissions and 685 companies in 69 subsectors, including main industries like steel, cement, and petrochemicals. Companies subject to the ETS are eligible for financial support from the government, which can be used to install energy-efficient equipment and processes.

In August 2022, the government had a Council meeting to discuss a revenue allocation plan and strategy to meet the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Sets of new rules will be launched for Phase 4 by 2026 (ICAP, 2022b). The government has reported that the total revenue in 2021 was KRW 257.7 million, allocated as climate response fund (ICAP, 2022a).

The majority of existing energy efficiency measures in industry are voluntary, such as the Energy Champion programme, the Energy Intensity Reduction Agreement, and the Energy Management System (IEA, 2020). The main regulation for energy efficiency in industry is the Target Management System, which requires companies that emit over 50 ktCO2e (or 15 ktCO2e for individual businesses), to set a legally binding energy reduction target in consultation with the government.

In 2021, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy launched the Green Steel Committee, which aims to align the domestic steel industry with South Korea’s climate neutrality target (Min-hee, 2021). At the launch, several major Korean steel manufacturers signed a joint statement for 2050 carbon neutrality, including POSCO, Hyundai Steel, Dongkuk Steel, KG Dongbu Steel, Seah Steel, and SIMPAC.


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector accounted for 18% of national CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (IEA, 2021a). The revised 2030 GHG roadmap intends to expand the supply of eco-friendly vehicles (including the supply of three million electric vehicles in 2030) (Ministry of Environment, 2018). In January 2019, the Korean Government also announced a roadmap for a hydrogen economy, setting goals of producing 6.2 million fuel cell electric vehicles and building 1,200 fuelling stations across the country by 2040 (MOTIE, 2019b).

The Green New Deal, announced in 2020, commits around USD 17bn to the development of eco-friendly vehicles and related infrastructure (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2020). By 2025 the government plans to introduce 1.13 million electric cars, 200,000 hydrogen cars, and scrap 2.2 million old diesel cars. A Climate Neutrality Roadmap (GESI et al., 2022) scenario suggests that a rapid adoption of around 10 million climate-friendly vehicles in road transport would lead to drastic reduction by more than 40% (41 MtCO2e) between 2018 (98 MtCO2e) and 2030 (57 MtCO2e).

Announced through the carbon neutral green growth vison and promotion strategy, government planned to lay out energy consumption strategy in industry sector by Introducing electric vehicle efficiency rating system and fuel efficiency system for mid-to-large sized trucks (MOLIT, 2022).

South Korea is the world’s fifth largest car manufacturing country (OICA, 2019) and home to major companies such as Hyundai and Kia. In 2014, South Korea strengthened its light-duty vehicle emissions standard to 97 gCO2/km by 2020 (Transportpolicy.net, 2019), which is comparable to the EU’s new standards (95 gCO2/km) (ICCT, 2019).

In December 2020, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced the First National Plan for the Development and Popularisation of Green Ships (2021-2030), which aims to explore advanced emissions-free technologies and sets targets to reduce shipping emissions by 70% by 2030 and convert 15% Korean ships to “green ships” (Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, 2021). Due to their technological advancement, South Korean shipbuilders won nearly 57% of global orders for eco-friendly ships in the first eight months of 2022 (Seanews, 2022).


## Buildings

In 2019, the buildings sector accounted for 8% of national CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (aggregate of residential and commercial sectors) (IEA, 2021a). South Korea is gradually applying stricter energy conservation designs to meet zero-energy buildings standards for all new buildings by 2025 (APERC, 2019).

The revised 2030 GHG roadmap outlines several policies and measures for reducing emissions from the sector, including strengthening permit standards for new buildings, promoting green renovation, identifying new circular business models, and expanding renewable energy supply. The reduction target from buildings is 35.8 MTCO2e by 2030 below 2016 baseline.

In addition, the Green New Deal commits around USD 4.5 billion to green remodeling, which aims to ensure that new and renovated buildings are energy-efficient and constructed from sustainable materials (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2020). By 2025 the Green New Deal plans to remodel 225,000 homes, 440 day-care centres, and 1,148 facilities. Also, through its Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth, South Korea intended to build a carbon neutral city in order to achieve carbon neutral spatially (Ministry of Environment, 2022b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in South Korea were taken from the PRIMAP National Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions Database (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2022). This data is provided in AR4. The latest historical datapoint in this set is 2021.


## NDC and other targets

The updated 2021 NDC sets a new target of 40% below 2018 levels (total emissions excl. LULUCF in 2018 compared to net emissions in 2030 – incl. reductions from LULUCF and international credits). The government report on the NDC update, published in October 2021, provides a breakdown of emissions per sector, in addition to details on targeted reductions and removals from LULUCF, CCUS, and overseas (Republic of Korea, 2021b). We convert the domestic and overall targets from SAR to AR4 following the method outlined below.

We recalculate the 2020 NDC with this information on the contribution of LULUCF sinks and international credits. This results in a 1 MtCO2e increase to 541 MtCO2e from our previous calculations that used assumptions on the use of LULUCF and international credits from South Korea’s first NDC (see assumptions in September 2021 assessment).

South Korea uses GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). We convert to AR4 GWP values to ease comparison of countries’ targets and emission trajectories. We use detailed emissions data per gas from the national inventory (SAR), and the SAR/AR4 GWPs to derive a full emissions dataset in AR4. We use the ratio of total emissions in SAR and AR4 in 2017 to convert the BAU to AR4 (the annual difference between SAR and AR4 is around 4.5 MtCO2e, with low variance). We apply the reduction stated in the NDC to the total emissions in AR4 GWPs.


## 2020 pledge

BAU projections for the 2020 pledge were taken from the Fourth National Communication (SAR) (The Government of The Republic of Korea, 2019). We convert the BAU to AR4 GWP following the method described above. We no longer consider the 2020 pledge when calculating the global temperature rise associated with the aggregated pledges of all countries.


## Current policy projections

Current policy projections are calculated based on emissions reductions below the BAU scenario from the 8th Edition of APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APERC, 2019) and the US EPA non-CO2 emission projections until 2030 (US EPA, 2019). Non-energy related CO2 emissions are assumed to remain constant at the 2021 level.

The APEC BAU is not used as a current policy scenario as its forecast for renewables share in power generation (7.6%) is comparable to the 2020 share of renewables (6%) (IEA, 2021c) and much lower than other studies, which range from 14% to 20% (J. H. Hong et al., 2019; Keramidas et al., 2018; Wood Mackenzie, 2019).

With no change to the five-year trend in renewables share, this would reach around 15% in 2030. We therefore consider the 10th Electricity Plan for the upper bound of current policies projections – 21.6% of RE in 2030. We derive the emissions projection from the APEC BAU by assuming additional generation from renewables replaces coal-fired power generation. We consider the targeted share under the revised Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) of 25% power generation from RE by 2030 (MOTIE, 2020) for the lower bound current policies projections. The average electricity CO2 emission factors for each fossil fuel type in South Korea were assumed to be similar to the values forecast for Japan in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA, 2020).


## Planned Policy Projection

South Korea’s planned policy projections (PPP) are constructed from the total domestic emission (exl. LULUCF) from two scenarios provided in South Korea’s carbon neutrality pathways (cite).


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality scenarios present 2050 emissions targets for each sector, in addition to details on targeted removals from LULUCF and CCUS. The CAT considers total emissions excl. LULUCF in 2050. The value is derived from the information provided and converted to AR4 by multiplying the value in SAR with the ratio of the 2017 values in AR4 and SAR. We assume that the target values presented cover all GHGs.


## COVID-19 impact

We apply a novel method to estimate the COVID-19-related dip in greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 and the deployment through to 2030. The uncertainty surrounding the severity and length of the pandemic creates a new level of uncertainty for current and future greenhouse gas emissions.

We first update the current policy projections using most recent projections, usually prepared before the pandemic. We then distil the emissions intensity (GHG emissions/GDP) from this pre-pandemic scenario and apply to it most recent GDP projections that take in to account the effect of the pandemic. To capture a range, we use projections from USEPA (2019), APEC (2022), and historical data series from PRIMAP 2022.

The quantification of South Korea’s current policies projections focuses on energy-related CO2 emissions reductions. For scenarios that already consider the impact of COVID-19, we do not adjust energy-related CO2 emissions, to avoid double-counting.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC submitted in 2021, South Korea has set an unconditional NDC target of reducing 40% GHG emissions below 2018 levels by 2030, a significant improvement on the previous NDC (24.4% below 2017 levels). Excluding the forestry contribution and reduction overseas, as described in an accompanying government document (Republic of Korea, 2021b), the target translates to a 37% reduction of domestic emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels, and the CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”, compared to required domestic efforts according to modelled domestic pathways.

The CAT rates the full target, including South Korea’s proposed procurement of carbon credits from other countries, as “Highly Insufficient” when compared to South Korea’s fair share. This assessment of South Korea’s target does not, at present, question the quality of the credits procured from abroad, and we were unable to identify sufficient information to examine this element of the NDC. As such our analysis may overestimate the mitigation impact of South Korea’s. South Korea has a net zero target set for 2050.

The absolute emissions target communicated by the government is 437 MtCO2e, using global warming potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC’s second assessment report (SAR). To ease comparison of country targets we convert to GWPs from the IPCC’s fourth assessment report (AR4) (see assumptions section). We estimate that the absolute emissions target in AR4 is 441 MtCO2e.

The CAT estimates the domestic component of the target as 501 MtCO2e (excl. reductions from LULUCF and international credits) and the full target including the international component as 468 MtCO2e (excl. reductions from LULUCF, incl. international credits), representing an 18% reduction compared to the NDC submitted in December 2020 (see assumptions section). The conversion of South Korea’s NDC to the common CAT metric is shown in the figure below.


## NDC Updates

South Korea submitted a stronger NDC in December 2021 – a 40% reduction in emissions compared to 2018 levels, including emissions reductions from LULUCF and international credits (Republic of Korea, 2021a).

## CAT rating of targets

South Korea has clearly stated the extent to which its NDC target will be achieved through domestic reductions and the portion of emission reductions that will be achieved through the support of action abroad. We rate the domestic component of its NDC against what needs to happen within its border based on modelled domestic pathways and the full NDC target (reduction achieved both domestically and abroad) against what a fair contribution would be.

NDC target (domestic) against modelled domestic pathways

We rate South Korea’s domestic target for 2030 as “Insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s domestic target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target (full) against fair share

We rate South Korea’s overall NDC target (including the domestic and the international element) as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s fair share target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

After former President Moon Jae-in announced South Korea’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, the government also included this commitment in its updated NDC and its Long-Term Strategy (Republic of Korea, 2020, 2021a). The carbon neutrality target is enshrined in law through the Carbon Neutrality Act, which was passed in August 2021 (Ministry of Environment, 2021) and enforced in March 2022 (Ministry of Environment, 2022b). In October 2021, South Korea published two carbon neutrality scenarios that are leading to net zero emissions in 2050 (Republic of Korea, 2021c). Both scenarios aim for coal phase out before 2050 but remain unclear about the exact phase out year. One of the scenarios maintains a share of natural gas, while the other one phases out gas by 2050 as well. South Korea is still not explicit in its coverage of GHGs, and the target review process lacks detail.

## 2020 pledge

Under the Copenhagen Accord, South Korea agreed to reduce its emissions by 30% below business-as-usual (BAU) emissions by 2020. It proposed this unconditional target in November 2009 and submitted it to the Copenhagen Accord on 25 January 2010. Under the BAU projections from the Third National Communication, the 2020 pledge would have resulted in emissions of 551 MtCO2e/year excluding LULUCF (equivalent to 83% above 1990 emission levels). Emissions in 2020 exceeded this target by around 21% at 670 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.
