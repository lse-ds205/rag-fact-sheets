# Summary


## Overview

**With Bhutan being a carbon negative country due to its large land sink, it is already compliant with its NDC target of remaining carbon (and GHG) neutral. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary drop in its emissions, we project that Bhutan's emissions will resume increasing over the course of the decade without additional policies. If allowed to increase unchecked, especially in the industry and transport sectors, they could exceed the level that is sequestered by forests. We rate Bhutan as ‘Almost sufficient’ overall.**

**In its second NDC, Bhutan reiterates its carbon neutrality goal, has developed sectoral emission reduction plans for all sectors, and has begun implementing measures on its transport and agriculture sectors. The full implementation of these measures falls within our 1.5°C compatible category for the level of emissions reductions needed within Bhutan’s borders. Bhutan needs international support to fully implement all of these measures.**

Recent developments include:

- Construction of the country’s first utility-scale solar plant, which is set to begin in the first half of 2023. The 17 MW plant is part of a broader government initiative to install 300 MW of solar over the next three years. These efforts will help diversify the largely hydropower-based grid and reduce reliance on winter energy imports.
- Geological uncertainties are delaying operations of under-construction hydro power projects, resulting in an escalation of project costs and mounting national debt. This calls for a diversification towards non-hydro renewable energy.
- Advancing on its electric vehicle (EV) policies, as the government has started setting up EV charging stations and supporting a shift to EVs in the taxi industry. These actions build on other efforts taken in the transport sector last year to strengthen vehicle emission standards, though some initiatives, like the rapid mass transit system, have not advanced.
- Expansion of its biogas production. Bhutan will establish a biogas plan as part of a new landfill in its capital city this year. It is promoting domestic biogas production in both its agriculture and waste management sectors.
- Bhutan has recently embarked on a strategy to develop its industrial parks and emissions are expected to grow significantly in this sector. The government has identified a number of mitigation measures it could take, with support, in its low-emissions industry strategy, but we could not find any evidence that it has begun to implement these.
The CAT rates Bhutan’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s climate commitments and policies are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, but could be with moderate improvements. This rating is based on a modification of the CAT’s standard approach to reflect the fact that Bhutan is already carbon neutral and to provide a more accurate picture of Bhutan’s emissions trajectory and actions. Details are provided under the targets page. Bhutan is close to a 1.5°C compatible rating, but would need to slow its emissions growth to achieve this rating. Bhutan will need international support to fully implement its policies and action.

We rate Bhutan’s current policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Bhutan’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond Bhutan’s fair share if the needed international support is provided.

Bhutan’s economy-wide emissions dropped by around 40% between 2019-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic-induced slowing down of economic activity. We project that emissions will resume increasing over the course of the decade, reaching around 2.8-3.0 MtCO2e/year in 2030 - an increase of 76-85% from 2010 level.

Bhutan has developed sectoral low-emission development plans, but the exact status of implementation of these plans can be difficult to determine. Bhutan is expanding its solar capacity to diversify its power generation. Electrification of the transport sector with increasing number of electric taxis and private vehicle is part of government plan along with expansion of charging infrastructure. In 2019, Bhutan adopted its Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap. Mitigation potential for some of these measures is included in our assessment of current policies and action. Other sectoral policy actions include forest conservation and management under the National REDD+ Strategy.

Bhutan will remain compliant with its NDC target of staying carbon (and GHG) neutral with currently implemented policies.

As Bhutan has already achieved its carbon neutral NDC target, rating this NDC target level (excluding the contribution of the forestry sector) based on the current net emissions produces misleading results, thus we have adopted an alternative method.

We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures from NDC are fully implemented against where its emissions would need to be based on a global least cost modelled domestic pathway for 1.5°C. The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C.

We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory (not current policies) against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. Our rating is based on the top end of this range and is "Almost sufficient". The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Bhutan's approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Bhutan has the potential to achieve a 1.5°C compatible rating if it manages to slow its emissions growth.

In 2020, Bhutan had a net carbon sink capacity of 8.9 MtCO2e which is pivotal for its carbon neutrality pledge. Bhutan implemented the REDD+ readiness programme and produced Bhutan’s National REDD+ Strategy and implementation framework. Forests currently cover 70% of Bhutan’s land, and it has a constitutional mandate to maintain this share above 60%.

Bhutan first committed to remaining carbon neutral during COP15, in Copenhagen in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 goal, which is essentially an extension of its carbon neutrality target and which it has already achieved. Bhutan is currently developing its long-term strategy which will be important to develop sectoral policies particularly for the energy and industry sector to curb the emissions. Until that strategy is released, we classify Bhutan’s net zero target as “information incomplete”.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: Bhutan submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC in September 2023. The assessment of Bhutan's LTS will be included in the next update.

We evaluate Bhutan’s net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.

Bhutan first committed to remaining carbon neutral during COP15 in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 indicative target, which it has already met, given that Bhutan is currently a net negative emitter. However, the NDC does not sufficiently detail how Bhutan will monitor this target - and not exceed it in the future.

Bhutan’s second NDC does not provide any clarification on the terms ‘carbon neutral’ and ‘net zero’, but its Climate Change Policy of 2020 defines ‘carbon neutral’ as covering all GHGs, not just CO2 emissions.

Further, Bhutan has adopted four Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS), targeting the transport, industrial, human settlement, and food sectors which are instrumental to remain carbon neutral. LEDS of these four sectors provides detail of the measures and their mitigation potential under each timeframe, along with specific investment need up to 2050. Yet, certain sectoral measures evaluate mitigation potential by considering avoided emissions resulting from hydro power to India. It remains unclear the extent of dependency of Bhutan’s net zero target on these avoided emissions.

Bhutan is currently working on its long-term strategy, but had not yet submitted it as of June 2023.

The CAT does not provide an overall rating of Bhutan’s net zero target design, given the lack of more detailed information. We will evaluate the target further once more information becomes available.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 target in its second NDC. It has already met this target given that Bhutan is currently a net negative emitter.
- **Emissions coverage** – Bhutan’s carbon neutrality target covers the three main greenhouse gases (i.e. CO2, CH4, N2O) as these are the most relevant gases in Bhutan. In its first Biennial Update Report, Bhutan reported emissions of HFCs from industrial process but these are less than 1% of Bhutan’s total emissions (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Bhutan has not commented on NF3 (Bhutan Government 2021). Bhutan has used the term ‘carbon neutrality’ and ‘net zero’ interchangeably in its NDC but its Climate Change Policy 2020 defines ‘carbon neutral’ as covering all GHGs not just CO2 emissions.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Bhutan does not provide any information on international aviation and shipping in its target.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Bhutan does not provide information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target by 2050. While some of its sectoral LEDS quantify the mitigation potential based on the premise of avoided emissions due to renewable hydropower exports to India, it is unclear whether its economy-wide net zero target of 2050 relies on these avoided emissions (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Bhutan’s 2050 net zero is included in its second NDC submission (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). Bhutan is currently preparing its LTS to support this target.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Bhutan does not provide any information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets. At present, Bhutan is a net negative country and its large-scale forest sinks are fundamental to its 2030 carbon neutrality target and its 2050 net zero target.
- **Review process** – Bhutan does not provide any information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Bhutan does not provide any information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Bhutan has developed Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS) for its transport, industrial, agricultural, and human settlement sectors. The LEDS cover short-term (2025), medium-term (2030), and long-term (2050) time frames against which identified mitigation measures can be achieved. LEDS of these four sectors provides detail of the measures and their mitigation potential under each timeframe along with specific investment need.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Bhutan does not provide any information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practices

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

Bhutan is already compliant with its NDC target of staying carbon (and GHG) neutral. While the pandemic caused a temporary drop in its emissions, we project that these will resume increasing over the course of the decade, reaching around 2.9-3.0 MtCO2e/year in 2030, but still well below the country’s net LULUCF sink of -7.8 MtCO2e and thus within its carbon neutral target.

The CAT rates Bhutan’s current policy and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Bhutan’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Bhutan has adopted four Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS), targeting the transport, industrial, human settlement, and food sectors, which include mitigation measures for 2030-2050 and for which support is needed to implement (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021; Ministry of Information and Communications 2021; Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021; Ministry of Economic Affairs 2021a; Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 2021).


## Policy overview

Bhutan’s second NDC proposes several short, medium and long term priority mitigation actions across a number of sectors to remain carbon neutral. Bhutan has started to implement some of these measures, particularly in its transport and agriculture sectors.

In its Third National Communication, Bhutan projected that it would stop being carbon neutral in the 2040s if emissions from energy sector continues to rise in the current rate. While those estimates were based on a smaller land sink than the second NDC target level, and historic emissions to 2020 have been lower than projected, the fact remains that Bhutan is at risk of exceeding its carbon neutral target in the long-term if emissions are allowed to increase unchecked, especially in its industry and transport sectors.

Climate Change PolicyIn 2020, Bhutan adopted a Climate Change Policy which restates the commitment it made at COP15 in 2009, to remain carbon neutral, which is now reiterated in its NDC (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020b). This policy has four main pillars: carbon neutrality, building resilience to climate change, means for implementation, and effective and coordinated actions. It aims to provide guidance to achieve a climate resilient and carbon neutral economy that contributes to gross national happiness. The policy was formulated in a participatory manner, and it wishes to ensure a continued participation of relevant stakeholders in climate change action.

Energy Efficiency & Conservation RoadmapIn November 2019, Bhutan launched its National Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Policy covering the building, appliances and industry sectors (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019). Along with the EE&C policy, the government released an energy efficiency roadmap which forms the basis for reviewing progress in implementing EE&C measures (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019). The roadmap outlines the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1.8 MtCO2e with EE&C measures over the course of 15 years and achieve energy savings of 1.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), over the same period. However, the measures the government intends to implement are on a much smaller scale.

Replacing biomass usage in the building sector is one of the main interventions of this policy, but that will help increase Bhutan’s sink capacity rather any cut emissions directly and also has wider health benefits by reducing indoor air pollution.

Additionally, as Bhutan’s grid is already emissions free, electricity saved by improving energy efficiency will not contribute to its own emission reductions, but will instead allow Bhutan to export more hydropower to India and displace emissions from the power sector there.

Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS)Bhutan’s efforts to remain carbon neutral have been further elaborated and refined through low emission development strategies (LEDS). LEDS for four key sectors (food security, human settlement, industries and transport) provide detailed mitigation measures, their emissions reduction potentials, and the international investment required to achieve them. These LEDS will serve as the basis for the sectors to integrate low carbon measures into development priorities. See the individual sector sections below for more details.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, several sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exitinitiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** Bhutan’s methane emissions are predominately from its largely subsistence agriculture.
- **Coal exit**: Bhutan does not have grid-connected coal capacity, though 5% of its primary energy mix in 2019 was from coal. Coal is mainly used in industry and standby power plants.
- **100% EVs**: Bhutan aims to have 70% of its passenger vehicle sales be EVs by 2035. It is working with the taxi industry to accelerate the update of EVs in that sector.
- **Forestry:** Bhutan is a signatory of the declaration on forest and land use during COP26. In 2020, it had a net sink capacity of 8.9 MtCO2e. Forests currently cover 70% of Bhutan’s land, and it has a constitutional mandate to maintain this share above 60%.
- **Beyond oil and gas**: This alliance was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. Bhutan has not joined of this alliance. Bhutan has no oil and gas reserves.

## Energy supply

Hydro powerBhutan has a considerable share of renewable energy both in its primary energy mix (82%) and electricity generation (100%) owing to its significant hydro capacity (IRENA 2021). Over the years, Bhutan has successfully developed its hydropower resources. In 2021, its total electricity capacity was 2.34 GW, of which 2.33 GW is hydro (IRENA 2021). However, this current hydro capacity is only 10% of its potential (CEA 2021).

In 2021, the Bhutanese government launched the Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy (SHDP) to enhance its previous hydropower policy by integrating climate resilience and mitigation options (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2021b). To reduce vulnerability to decreasing water flows in the dry season, the SHDP focuses on adaptation measures, such as pumped storage schemes.

The Bhutanese government allocated BTN 372.062m (USD 5m) for energy in its 2020-21 budget. Key activities include a hydro project (the 2.6 GW Kuri-Gongri Hydroelectric Project) and a hydro feasibility study, on-grid electrification of off-grid rural households, and support for renewable and energy efficient technology in buildings (Ministry of Finance 2020).

Exporting hydropower contributes significantly to Bhutan’s economy, accounting for 63% of its total exports in 2019 (Royal Bhutanese Embassy 2020). It also plays an important role in reducing fossil fuels outside of Bhutan’s geographical boundary as the power displaces more emissions intensive sources of electricity in India. In its continued focus on hydro power, the government has revised its Power System Master Plan 2040 to explore its full hydro potential (MOEA-DHPS 2019).

Geological uncertainties and pandemic restrictions caused a number of delays in the further development of hydro power (Dolkar 2022). These delays have increased project costs and further exerted pressure on the already mounting national budget deficit as well as Bhutan’s external debt.

By the end of 2022, hydropower debt stood at 69% of Bhutan’s total external debt, out of which hydro debt to India is around 75% (ORF 2022; Kuensel Online 2023a). These higher costs will necessitate a higher tariff rate, which, in turn, may jeopardise the viability of exporting hydro power to India as that country’s tariff for renewable energy is falling (Kuensel Online 2022a).

As Bhutan will be graduating from the Least Developed Country group by the end of 2023, it is important for Bhutan to ensure macroeconomic stability and this high amount of fiscal deficit and external debt could be a bottleneck for that.

Non-hydro renewable energyA study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found a strong case for energy diversification in Bhutan to support economic growth, industrial development and employment (IRENA 2019). Non-hydro renewable energy can complement Bhutan’s hydro power, by increasing electricity access in rural areas, and utilising technologies with different generation profiles, creating a diversified power system with less reliance on seasonal weather (IRENA 2019). Moreover, hydro project construction is not without risks as it requires blasting and can cause building cracks (Gyelmo 2020).

The 2016 Renewable Energy Master Plan estimated that the country could produce 12 GW of solar and 760 MW of wind energy (DRE–MOEA 2016). Notwithstanding this enormous potential, Bhutan set a modest 2025 target of 20 MW. Currently, it has about 9 MW of non-hydro capacity, which means it still needs 11 MW to fulfil the Alternative Renewable Energy Policy target within three years (IRENA 2021).

Bhutan is part of the International Solar Alliance launched during COP21 in 2015. The Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) has begun Bhutan’s first ground-mounted PV solar project of 180 kW in September 2021 (Kuensel Online 2021). Although a small project, it is expected to show the feasibility of solar projects in Bhutan.

The Bhutanese government is also planning to add 300 MW of solar capacity by 2026, exceeding its current target of 20 MW, and primary site selection is currently underway (Gyeltshen 2022; Kuensel Online 2023b). ADB will be providing financing and technical assistance to achieve this target and has approved a USD 10m for Bhutan’s first utility scale solar plant, with peak capacity of 17.38 MW (Asian Development Bank 2022; Gyeltshen 2022).

India’s ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ initiative of achieving cross-border solar resource connectivity in West and South East Asia could help Bhutan to diversify its energy mix (Financial Express 2020). Bhutan already has electricity trade with India and draft procedural guidelines are in place for firms to participate in electricity trade, which will be helpful in future cross-border non-hydro renewable trade.

Bhutan is considering the viability of hydrogen fuel in the country and the government has initiated preparation of a Green Hydrogen Roadmap and pilot projects (Zangpo 2022).


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) emissions accounted for 38% of total emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2020 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Since 2010, industry emissions have increased by around 60%. The largest share of industrial emissions are from metal and cement production (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Bhutan has recently embarked on a strategy to develop industrial parks to diversify its economy, thus the sector’s emissions are expected to increase further (Business Bhutan 2022a; Royal Government of Bhutan 2022).

The 2021 Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) for Industries identified mitigation opportunities through technical measures, and diversification of the sector away from heavy industries with cross cutting benefits to other sectors. Bhutan estimated that the cost of implementing its industrial LEDS would be USD 3.52m (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). We could not find any evidence that Bhutan has begun to implement this strategy.

The 2019 Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) policy estimates 10% of energy consumption in industry can be avoided (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019). The EE&C policy includes the development of energy efficiency codes, guidelines and (unspecified) energy efficiency upgrade measures through retrofits, refurbishments, technology transfer and process modification. The energy efficiency roadmap outlines interventions in the industry sector to achieve emissions reductions of up to 7% per year compared to a baseline scenario by 2030 (Dept. Renewable Energy 2019).


## Transport

In 2019, the transport sector contributed around 64% of energy related emissions and 18% of the total GHG emissions, which dropped to 56% and 14% respectively in 2020 due to the pandemic (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022).

Bhutan has several policies, plans, strategies and other initiatives to reduce emissions from land transport.

In 2021, the Bhutanese government, along with UNDP, revised its 2016 Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) for Surface Transport through a series of consultation workshops and focus group discussions with stakeholders. High private vehicle ownership is the main concern of government, as light vehicles (including taxis), and two wheelers currently account for approximately 80% of the total registered vehicle (Ministry of Information and Communication 2021a).

The 2021 Surface Transport LEDS contains a number of options to reduce emissions from passenger transport, such as shared mobility, electric vehicles, the promotion of active transport, car imports and sale limits, and rapid mass transit. One of the interventions, adopting the Euro VI emissions standard, was implemented in 2022 (Kuensel Online 2022b). Its mitigation potential is 0.01 MtCO2e/yr and has been included in our current policy projections.

The Bhutanese government is also advancing in measures to electrify its transport sector. The Bhutan Electric Vehicle (EV) Roadmap (2020-2025) contains short, medium and long-term targets for EV uptake.

Bhutan aims for electric vehicles to make up 70% of passenger vehicle sales in the next 13 years, by 2035 (Kuensel Online 2022c). The government has begun setting up EV charging stations and is working on shifting to EVs in the taxi industry (Ministry of Information and Communication 2021b; South Asia Monitor 2021; Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019; Norbu 2022; UNDP 2018) . The government has offered a 20% subsidy and access to 70% loans for electric taxis and is considering a host of other financial incentives to promote green vehicles (Kuensel Online 2020).

The cost of LEDS interventions ranges from relatively inexpensive measures to large infrastructure investments, with an overall total investment of USD 3.2bn needed by 2030. Bhutan has received some assistance to begin to implement these measures (Ministry of Information and Communication 2021a). For instance, the Global Environment Facility has earmarked over USD 18m to assist in the development of sustainable, low-emission urban transport systems (Global Environment Facility 2017). The Clean Technology Fund, Asian Development Bank, World Bank Group and the Japan Fast Start Fund Initiative are also providing support.


## Buildings

Bhutan continues to experience rapid urbanisation, with a corresponding increase in GHG emissions and energy consumption in the buildings sector (Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021). Buildings account for the highest energy consumption in Bhutan, from the burning of biomass for heating and cooking (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019).

The 2021 Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) for Human Settlement identified a number of mitigation measures for the sector, including solar PV on buildings, which has the co-benefit of reducing electricity import needs in the dry winter months, and replacing LPG and firewood for heating and cooking by electricity. This will also bring health co-benefits. Enhanced energy efficient and green building design to reduce energy consumption for space heating and cooling are also included in the strategy.

The 2019 Energy Efficiency Policy (EE&C policy) includes the development and implementation of efficiency building codes for new buildings and for retrofits of established buildings (Ministry of Economic Affairs 2019). The building code will include Energy Audit and Reporting Guidelines for energy audits of buildings energy performance. The government will support hotels to adopt EE&C measures and publicly recognise good performers, in addition to developing stakeholder capacity for implementing building codes.


## Agriculture

Agriculture accounted for 20% of Bhutan’s total emissions in 2019, which increased marginally to 24% in 2020 due to a fall in emissions from other sector (excluding LULUCF) (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Bhutan considers these to be ‘survival’ emissions as they are derived from subsistence farming with little chemical input. Enteric fermentation and manure management accounts for 76% of the sector’s emissions (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022).

In its third national communication, the government projected a sharp increasing trend in agriculture-related emissions under BAU between 2015 and 2025, then stabilising until 2030 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020b). However, this did not materialise as agricultural emissions have broadly remained constant between 2015-2020 with a drop in 2019-2020.

The 2021 Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) for Food Security laid out mitigation options in the agriculture sector, consisting of organic farming, reducing the use of synthetic nitrogen containing fertilisers, and crop selection (Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 2021). It also includes improving productivity in the livestock sector through improved grazing and a variety of high yield animals and improved manure management by promoting biogas generation from animal manure. Overall, the mitigation potential of these measures is 0.5 MtCO2e/year by 2030, which will require an estimated investment of USD 61.65m.

In 2002, Bhutan started to move towards organic farming and, in 2007, adopted a National Framework for Organic Farming (Agroecology Info Pool 2019). In 2012, during the Rio summit, Bhutan announced its intention to adopt fully organic agricultural practices by 2020. As of 2022, only 5.6% of Bhutan’s agricultural land has been certified as organic, but around 80% of the Bhutanese farms are traditionally organic as they do not use synthetic agro-chemicals (Heinrich Böll Stiftung Hong Kong 2022; Business Bhutan 2022b).

Bhutan is still importing synthetic fertiliser from India (The Bhutanese 2022). Even with a high share of organic land, Bhutan was not able to achieve this target due to lack of government support to promote organic fertiliser adoption and use of new technology. Organic fertiliser shortages also contributed to this(Feuerbacher et al. 2018).

Bhutan is promoting domestic biogas production using food and animal waste, an important mitigation action in agriculture and food waste management (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Increasing use of biogas would enable Bhutan to improve crop yields by using the organic by-products of biogas plants.

Bhutan has a total of 70.77 % forest cover (2,717,162 ha) of the total geographical area of the country which serves as the cornerstone of its commitment to remain carbon neutral. The land use change and forestry sector was a net sink of about 8.9 MtCO2e in 2020, through managed forests and forest plantations as well as abandonment of managed land (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the NDC mandate that 60% of the country remain under forest cover indefinitely. Bhutan is one of the signatories of the Glasgow pledge on forestry and land use and committed to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030.

Bhutan does not have a high forest degradation rate, but has still established a national REDD+ framework and produced a National REDD+ Strategy (NRS) and implementation framework (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). The NRS seeks to strengthen forest management practices, integrate land use planning, and improve rural livelihoods. Specific targets such as improved forest management and conservation and maintaining at least 50% of land under area, are to maintain 436 MtCO2 of forest carbon stock outside protected areas by 2030 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021).


## Waste

In 2020, waste sector emissions are about 5% of Bhutan’s total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). Emissions have been rising slowly, doubling between 2000 and 2019. Emissions from waste water treatment and discharge accounted for over 85% of total waste related GHG emissions, and are mostly methane.

In June 2019, Bhutan released its National Waste Management Strategy to achieve “zero waste Bhutan by 2030” (National Environment Commission 2019).

The Royal Government of Bhutan adopted a waste management programme in 2020 which is aligned with the National Waste Management Strategy. This strategy has introduced waste segregation, together with an adequate number of waste collection facilities and drop-off centres at convenient locations (Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021).

In 2021, Bhutan published its LEDS for Human Settlement which contains measures for wastewater management and to increase composting and recycling (Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021).

Bhutan is prioritising small and medium scale biogas production through food waste which is also one of the mitigation strategy laid out in LEDS of Human Settlement (Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021; WWF 2023). Bhutan Ecological Society (BES) is investing about Nu 60m (USD 0.7m) to construct a biogas plant in the upcoming new landfill at Memeylakha, Thimphu (Kuensel Online 2022d).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the period 1994-2020 are from the national GHG inventory reporting from Bhutan’s first Biennial Update Report (BUR1) (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). The BUR1 covers emissions from the three main GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and some F-gases (HFCs, but not PFCs, NF3 or SF6).

To complete the timeseries for the period 1990-1993, we have applied sectoral growth rates from the PRIMAPhist data series for Bhutan to the BUR1 data (Gütschow et al. 2022). We have not used PRIMAP growth rates to estimate emissions in 2021 as alternative methods produced more accurate results. PRIMAP data shows emissions essentially unchanged from 2019 levels in 2020 and a slight 2% increase in 2021. By contrast, government data reports an 18% drop in emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2020 – which is more consistent with the economic slowdown the country experienced. As the economy continued to contract in 2021, we would expect emissions to fall as well.

2021-2022 historical emissions estimateEnergy and industry emissions for 2021 and 2022 are calculated using IMF GDP growth rates as a proxy for emission growth rates (IMF 2022). We assume that the pandemic had minimal impact on the agriculture and waste sectors, so we use a pre-COVID 5-year trend (2015-2019) to estimate emissions for 2021 and 2022. For reference, Bhutan reported a 4-5% drop in those sectors in 2020, compared to a 20-25% drop in energy and industry emissions.

LULUCFLULUCF emissions data for the period 1994-2020 is taken from the First Biennial Update Report (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022).


## NDC and other targets

NDC targetsBhutan’s NDC target is to remain carbon neutral. In other words, Bhutan must keep emissions below the level of its LULUCF sink. In its second NDC, Bhutan states that its LULUCF sink is based on 2015 as its base year; it uses the same estimate in its Third National Communication (NC3) (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021, 2020a). Bhutan reported a net LULUCF sink of 7.8 MtCO2e in its NC3 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a). We use this estimate for our NDC quantification. It is worth nothing that Bhutan reported a larger net sink capacity of 8.9 MtCO2e in its first Biennial Report (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). If Bhutan were to update the source of its carbon neutral target to this document, it could, in theory, allow for even further emissions growth.

We do not use the NDC emissions estimate for our CAT ratings (see Targets tab for the full explanation). Instead, we rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures are fully implemented against where its emissions would need to be based on global least cost modelled pathway for 1.5°C.

CAT estimate for rating against fair shareThe methods used to develop a BAU projection for Bhutan are described in the ‘current policy projection’ section below. We use the upper range of the estimate as the basis for the rating.

CAT estimate for rating against modelled domestic pathwaysWe use mitigation potentials provided in Bhutan’s second NDC and its sectoral LEDS to estimate where Bhutan’s 2030 emissions would be if it receives the necessary support (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021; Ministry of Information and Communications 2021; Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021; Ministry of Economic Affairs 2021a; Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 2021). The estimates are cumulative potential for the decade, so we divide by 10 to derive an annual figure for 2030. We subtract these estimates from our BAU projections and rate the upper end of the range.

Several measures included in the LEDS for human settlement and industries quantify the mitigation potential based on emissions avoided through enhanced export of renewable energy to India (thereby displacing more GHG intensive sources of power). We exclude these emissions reductions as they occur outside of Bhutan’s borders.

The measures included in our quantifications are:

For industries:

- Reductant substitution by biogenic charcoal
- Cement blending
- Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) use in cement plants
- Direct hot charging
For human settlement:

- Replacement of LPG and firewood by electricity
- Increase in composting and recycling
- Wastewater management
Bhutan does not provide a breakdown of the emissions reductions associated with shifting to electric cookstoves from LPG and firewood. We use the estimates provided in the LEDS for the 2019 share of each source and assume that LPG will produce roughly twice as many emissions to derive the LPG share. The mitigation potential is based on a 50/50 grid factor split with India, so we double the estimate to consider only the impact in Bhutan.

The mitigation potential provided for transport section actions differs between the NDC and the LEDS. We take the estimate in the LEDS as it is more clearly linked to measures that would be implemented provided sufficient support is made available.

GWP conversionBhutan’s second NDC uses Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). As the NDC refers to a number of LEDS estimates, we assume that the LEDS also use SAR values, though this is not explicitly stated in those reports. No information was given on the gas-by-gas breakdown. We have assumed that the mitigation potential relates to CO2 emissions only for transport and industry and thus no conversion is needed.

For agriculture, we used the same approach adopted for our current policy projections (see below) and a 4:1 split between CH4 and N2O for the rest of the measures proposed.

For the human settlement sector, we used the same approach adopted for our current policy projections (see below) for the composting and wastewater management and assume that the electric cookstove relates to CO2 only.

Net zero targetBhutan is carbon neutral and has committed to remaining so. We include Bhutan in our Optimistic scenario as part of our 2100 temperature warming estimates; however, we do not quantify a separate long-term emissions target for Bhutan but rather include them in a conservative global estimate.


## Current policy projections

To estimate Bhutan’s emissions under current policies, we subtracted the estimated mitigation potential for policies for which we could find evidence of implementation from our business as usual (BAU) estimates.

**BAU projections**The bottom end of our BAU range is based on the low-growth scenario included in Bhutan’s Third National Communication, harmonized to latest historic year. The GDP growth in this scenario is 4.2% (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a). BUR1 does not provide any updated BAU estimates.

The top end of BAU has been derived using IMF GDP growth rates as a proxy for emissions growth for the period 2023-2027 and assuming emissions follow the 5-year trend for the remainder of the decade (2028-2030) (IMF 2022). Average GDP growth under this method is 5%. The Third National Communication’s high-growth scenario assumed 8%; however, in light of the pandemic, we consider the estimates from the IMF to be more likely.

**Implemented policies**The Third National Communication lists the mitigation potential of various sectoral measures (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a). Several sector LEDS also provided information on the mitigation potential of various measures. We have considered only those measures for which we could find evidence of implementation and subtracted their impact from our BAU estimates to derive our current policy projections. Sector specific policies considered for the current policy projections are outlined below. These mitigation potential estimates are developed using various BAU trajectories, however we have not adjusted for this fact.

TransportWe could only find evidence of implementation of the Euro VI emissions standard and some EV related measures (EV charging station and promotion of electric taxis) for transport sector (Kuensel Online 2022c; Ministry of Information and Communication 2021a; Kuensel Online 2022b).

The Euro VI emission standard has been implemented since January 2022 (Kuensel Online 2022b). To estimate an annual reduction, we divided the cumulative mitigation potential estimate, provided in transport LEDS for the period 2021-2025, by 4 (as the measures was planned to begin in 2022). We assume that the level of annual reductions will remain constant throughout the rest of the decade. This reduction is included in both policy projections.

For the EV measures, we used the electric passenger vehicle mitigation potential estimate provided in the transport LEDS. As it is not clear whether all EV related measures associated with this estimate are being implemented, we only included the mitigation potential from this measure in the lower end of the current policy projection.

We assume that the emissions estimates provided in the transport LEDS is for CO2 only.

Agriculture & wasteWhile Bhutan did not achieve its organic farming target, we think it is still advancing policy action in this area (see main policy section for details) and is also advancing on its biogas plans (see discussion in the Waste section of the policy tab).

We have taken mitigation potential of organic farming and biogas production from the LEDS of Food Security to estimate the effect of these policy actions (Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 2021). The LEDS does not specify which GWPs are used to calculate its figures, however we assume it to be SAR values as that is what was used in the NDC update. BUR1 does not provide a gas by gas breakdown of emissions for the agriculture sector, however based on the information provided we estimate that emissions are roughly 80% methane and 20% N2O (Royal Government of Bhutan 2022). (This breakdown is also consistent with PRIMAP data for the sector for the pre-pandemic period). We use this split to convert the organic farming estimate to AR4 GWP. For biogas production, only methane emissions will be reduced and GWP is converted to AR4 accordingly.

The Human Settlement LEDS includes two measures for the waste sector relating to composting and wastewater management for which activities are being implemented (see the discussion in the Waste sector of our policies tab for more details) (Ministry of Works and Human Settlement 2021). We assume that these measures will reduce methane emissions only (the electricity generation associated with the wastewater management is negligible) and have converted the GWP from SAR to AR4 for that gas only.

Energy efficiency RoadmapIn 2019, Bhutan adopted Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap for building, appliances and industries (Dept. Renewable Energy 2019). As Bhutan’s hydroelectricity is considered to have zero emissions, the energy savings from the appliance measures will have no impact on Bhutan’s emissions (though may allow it to export more electricity to India, offsetting higher emitting sources of power there). Much of the building sector mitigation potential is from biomass use reduction, which will eventually contribute to Bhutan’s sink capacity, and not fossil emissions. CAT estimates are excluding LULUCF, thus we have only considered industry sector mitigation potential from Energy Efficiency Roadmap. This estimate still includes some biomass, albeit a much smaller amount, and we have not adjusted it. We assume all emission reductions are CO2 only. The Roadmap includes two estimates, the maximum potential reductions for the sector 0.02 MtCO2e over a 15-year period as well as an estimate for the selected measures the government will purse, we use the latter.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

Bhutan’s second NDC target is to remain carbon neutral. In other words, Bhutan must keep emissions below the level of its net LULUCF sink. In its second NDC, Bhutan states that its LULUCF sink is based on a 2015 base year as it uses the estimate in its Third National Communication (NC3) (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). Bhutan reported a net LULUCF sink of 7.8 MtCO2e in its NC3 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a). Following standard CAT rating methodology, this target would be rated as “Critically insufficient” compared to both Bhutan’s fair share and to the emissions reductions needed within its borders to limit warming to 1.5°C based on global least cost pathways.

We have applied an alternative method to rate Bhutan’s NDC, given the fact that it is already carbon neutral (see below for details). Under this approach, we rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. This results in an “Almost sufficient” rating. When we rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures are fully implemented against where its emissions would need to be based on a global least cost modelled pathway for 1.5°C, Bhutan is rated as “1.5°C global least cost”.

In its second NDC, Bhutan has mentioned the goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, but given Bhutan’s current carbon negative status, this goal has already been achieved. The CAT currently does not evaluate Bhutan’s net zero target as no further information has been provided beyond the NDC. We will further evaluate the target once more information becomes available.


## CAT rating of targets

CAT estimate against modelled domestic pathways

We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures are fully implemented - against where its emissions would need to be based on a 1.5°C global least cost modelled pathway. On that basis, we find it to be 1.5°C global least compatible.

We estimate Bhutan emissions will be between at 1.8-1.9 MtCO2e in 2030 if it implements all sectoral mitigation measures presented in its various low emissions development strategies (LEDS) for the transport, agriculture, human settlements, and industry sectors. Our rating is based on the upper value of the range.

The "1.5°C global least cost" rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. Bhutan’s target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort.

It is important to highlight that Bhutan’s NDC and LEDS provide an estimate of implementation costs for the suggested actions and that Bhutan will need international support to achieve these reductions.

If we followed the standard CAT rating method, Bhutan’s NDC target of “carbon neutrality” – which we take as equivalent to its net LULUCF sink of 7.8 MtCO2e (CAT rates targets excluding the forestry sector) – would be rated as “Critically insufficient” when compared to the level of emission reductions needed within Bhutan’s borders in order to limit warming to 1.5°C. This rating would imply that Bhutan’s NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

However, Bhutan is already carbon neutral and making efforts to remain carbon neutral through the implementation of policies and measures. Applying our standard methodology would be misleading and unfair. A 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway based on global least cost shows what would be feasible for Bhutan to achieve with international support.

A more realistic and fair method would be to apply a rating based on the anticipated level of where emissions would be if Bhutan receives support for all of the measures it has planned, and this is what we have done.

CAT estimate against fair share

We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. Under this approach, we rate Bhutan as “Almost sufficient”.

We estimate Bhutan’s emissions under this approach to be between 3.02-3.13 MtCO2e in 2030. Our rating is based on the upper range of the estimate.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Bhutan’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Again, following the standard CAT rating method – where we would rate Bhutan’s NDC target to “remain carbon neutral”, estimated as 7.8 MtCO2e in 2030, against its fair contribution – we would rate Bhutan as “Critically insufficient”. This would indicate that Bhutan’s target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C based on its fair share contribution.

However, Bhutan is already carbon neutral and is making efforts to remain carbon neutral through the implementation of policies measures. Applying our standard methodology would be misleading and unfair. For a country like Bhutan, its fair share contribution represents what would be fair to do using its own resources. As Bhutan has indicated it will need support to implement the measures outlined in its NDC, using a business as usual projection is a good measure of where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 with its own resources and thus a more realistic and fair basis upon which to apply the CAT rating. The upper end of range falls within the "Almost sufficient" category. Bhutan could become 1.5°C compatible in the future if it slows its emissions growth.

## NDC Updates

Bhutan’s second NDC, submitted in June 2021, did not change the country’s carbon neutral target that it has had since 2009, and has been achieving. However, as a result of inventory data revisions, the ultimate emissions level of this target has increased.

Bhutan’s target to remain carbon neutral is admirable, especially given its Least Developed Country status. However, increasing energy and industry emissions could put Bhutan in a difficult position and could potentially jeopardise its ability to remain carbon neutral in the long-term, and risks breaching its carbon neutrality. Its Third National Communication projected that Bhutan would stop being carbon neutral in the 2040s. While those estimates were based on a smaller land sink, and given that historic emissions to 2020 have been lower than projected, the fact remains that Bhutan is at risk so long as emissions in these sectors continue to grow.

In its second NDC, Bhutan provided much greater detail on the types of mitigation measures it seeks to implement and the international support it needs.

*Bhutan's NDC target of remaining carbon neutral remains unchanged, however the estimate is higher because of revised inventory data.**Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.***The CAT adopts a different approach to rating Bhutan’s NDC target.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments**

- 24 June 2021 “Bhutan submits a second NDC”

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Bhutan has set an indicative goal of reaching net zero by 2050 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021).

Bhutan first committed to remain carbon neutral during COP15 in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 target, which it has already met given it is currently a net negative emitter. However, the NDC does not sufficiently detail how this target will be monitored and not exceeded in the future.

The CAT currently does not evaluate Bhutan’s net zero target due to a lack of information. We will update our assessment once more information becomes available.

**For the full analysis click** **here****.**


## 2020 target

Bhutan adopted a carbon neutral target in 2009 and has respected that target throughout the intervening years. Its ability to achieve this target is due to its large land sector sink, as its fossil emissions have increased during this period.
