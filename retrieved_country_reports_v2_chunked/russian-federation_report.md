## Country: Russian Federation

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8147):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Russia has not provided any information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. **Target architecture**   - **Legal status** – Russia’s ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation for low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’, which contains its 2060 net zero target, was approved via government order, akin to legislation, in October 2021 (Russian Federation, 2021a). Russia submitted its Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC in September 2022 (Russian Federation, 2022c).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8287):**
> The enormous increase in negative emissions achieved through the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector means that steep reductions in emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels would not be necessary to achieve net zero emissions. The steep increase in negative emissions raises questions as to the viability of Russia’s planned approach to reach net zero emissions given emissions from fossil fuel combustion are projected to remain high until 2050. We evaluate the target as “Poor”.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7838):**
> - **Emissions coverage** – Although the long-term climate strategy does not explicitly list all greenhouse gases covered, the document mentions Russia aims to balance anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by "no later than 2060". Based on this, we interpret the strategy to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. The target covers all sectors of the economy (excluding international aviation and shipping).
