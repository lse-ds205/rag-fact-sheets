## Country: Saudi Arabia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8108):**
> **We evaluate the target as: Poor. **   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia’s net zero target for 2060 at the first Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021. However, the target has yet to be enshrined in law or in a policy document.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8078):**
> The lower end of the BAU range reflects the KAPSARC BAU scenario, excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). For the upper end of the range, we have assumed that LULUCF measures would contribute 200 MtCO2e of the total 278 MtCO2e emissions reductions in the NDC. This number is based on the announcements made at the Saudi Green Initiative Forum in 2021.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8013):**
> Saudi Arabia is taking steps to improve energy efficiency in buildings. Through the national Energy Services Company, TARSHID, the government aims to renovate numerous government buildings, public schools, hospitals, and mosques throughout the country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021b). Efforts are also underway to develop and implement an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) ecosystem (Saudi Arabia, 2024).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8180):**
> To do so, we calculate the difference in electricity sector emissions resulting from KAPSARC’s renewable energy scenario and the new NDC target of 50% natural gas and renewable energy, and subtract it from the upper end of our planned policies range. ## Net-zero target and other long-term targets   The Saudi government has announced it aims to achieve a sink of 200 MtCO2 from 2030 onwards, which we assume to stay constant towards 2060 to meet Saudi Arabia’s net-zero CO2 target. Given the lack of information on Saudi Arabia’s net zero target announcement, we have assumed it aims to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2060.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8066):**
> The Circular Carbon Economy approach, however, only addresses a fraction of relevant emissions from oil and gas production through carbon capture and storage technologies, but most emissions come from fuel combustion rather than oil and gas extraction and processing. - **Clarity on fairness of target **– Saudi Arabia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness. ## Good practice   The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets.
