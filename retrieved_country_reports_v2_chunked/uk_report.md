### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8456):**
> **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”. The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8537):**
> Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8391):**
> - In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting. In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses. However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8452):**
> **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”. The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7958):**
> In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.
