### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8470):**
> The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied. ## NDC and other targets   Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8366):**
> The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen. Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8500):**
> The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen. Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8242):**
> The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.
