### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8525):**
> - It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency. We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8126):**
> **Upper bound**   For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy. The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8347):**
> At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023). We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7928):**
> - It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency. We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF).
