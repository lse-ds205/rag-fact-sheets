## Country: The Gambia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8087):**
> The net zero goal has interim targets for 2025 and 2030. - **Clarity on fairness of target** – The Gambia’s 2050 Climate Vision explains that the target is fair since The Gambia’s contribution to climate change has always been marginal (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b). ## Good practice   The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8259):**
> It will undertake two mitigation measures in forestry and energy using its own resources. The mitigation potential of these unconditional measures would result in an absolute emissions level of about 5.53 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF by 2030.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7826):**
> It will undertake two mitigation measures in forestry and energy using its own resources. The mitigation potential of these unconditional measures would result in an absolute emissions level of about 5.53 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF by 2030.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8170):**

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7667):**
> We consider the government reported data to be the most up to date estimate available and so use it as a starting point, rather than simply using the entire PRIMAP data set. Our estimates are about 0.5MtCO2e higher than PRIMAP. 2020-2021 estimates****To estimate historic emissions in 2020-2021, we first derived individual gas estimates for 2019 using the ratios for CO2, CH4, and N2O in PRIMAP.
