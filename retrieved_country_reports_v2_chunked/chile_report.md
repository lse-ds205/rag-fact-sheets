### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8486):**
> - **Industrial processes, agriculture, and waste emissions:** based on Chile’s Fifth Biennial Update Report (BUR5) (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022). For the lower range of our current policy projections, we use:   - **All sectors, including energy:** based on the ‘Transición tardía’ projections from Chile’s Fifth Biennial Report (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022). For ‘other’ sector emissions in both scenarios, we have taken a 10-year historical trend (2010-2019) from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8357):**
> This provision builds upon the existing Calificación Energética de Viviendas (CEV), established in 2011, and is also integrated into voluntary national building sustainability certifications (Ministerio de Energía, 2021b). The Energy Efficiency Law also states that companies with high energy consumption (over 50 tcal) must annually report their energy consumption and energy intensity. It also introduces an Energy Management System (EMS), covering at least 80% of total energy consumption that includes an energy efficiency action plan, goals, and performance indicators.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8297):**
> ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   **We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable. **   Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, the target was also included in the LTS and, since June 2022, it is enshrined in law with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8202):**
> The Electromobility Strategy guides climate policy in the transport sector and sets out an action plan to electrify 100% of the urban public transport vehicle fleet by 2050 and ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines in 2035. Chile has also introduced a carbon tax (Law 20.780/2014), although its price is likely too low to result in emissions reductions. In June 2022, Chile passed the Framework Law on Climate Change (21455) (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).
