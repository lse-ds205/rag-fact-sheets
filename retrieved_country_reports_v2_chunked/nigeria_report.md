**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8256):**
> The Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, published in 2023, sets a net zero target year of 2060 within the framework of the Climate Change Act (National Climate Change Council, 2023a). The plan targets significant long-term action through sectoral targets; however, it relies heavily on action after 2030. Under the 2021 Climate Change Act, the government is required to develop a carbon tax and carbon trading.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8156):**
> The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to achieve net zero by 2060, considered in our planned policies scenario, requires significant international support. The government aimed to secure an initial USD 10 billion support package ahead of COP27 to kickstart implementation, but has not secured sufficient financing as of December 2024. Nigeria has adopted new measures and announced plans to reduce emissions:   - The Electricity Act of 2023 aims to address challenges plaguing the power sector by decentralising and privatising the sector and removing barriers to the deployment of minigrids.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8273):**
> **   In 2024, Nigeria submitted its new Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which confirms their announced target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. However, of the four scenarios in the LT-LEDS, only the Renewable Energy Scenario achieves the net-zero target. The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to achieve net zero by 2060, considered in our planned policies scenario, requires significant international support.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8283):**
