### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8330):**
> **Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   **We evaluate the net zero target as: Target information incomplete. **   Indonesia has not yet communicated an explicit net zero target but explores scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2060 or sooner in its long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021 (Government of Indonesia, 2021).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8245):**
> We add these energy-CO2 projections to energy non-CO2 and non-energy emissions projections to obtain current policies projections for total emissions excl. LULUCF. For each sector we create a projection based on the growth rates forecast in Indonesia’s Second Biennial Update Report (Republic of Indonesia, 2018a).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8457):**
> The National Energy Policy (KEN), outlined in Government Regulation No. 79 of 2014, sets targets for the minimum share of new and renewable energy (23%), coal (30%), and gas (22%) in the energy mix by 2025. The General Plan for National Energy (RUEN: Rencana Umum Energi Nasional) (or Presidential Regulation No.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8365):**
> Similarly, it is inconsistent with the Accelerated Renewable Energy Scenario in the upcoming Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) and National Electricity Master Plan (RUKN) drafts stipulating 25% renewables share by 2030 and up to 73% by 2050, with the on-grid power system achieving net zero by 2060 (JETP Secretariat, 2023). Meeting these goals remains challenging due to the country’s difficulty attracting large investments, ongoing electricity oversupply issues, and policies that artificially lower coal prices, such as the Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) and price cap, making coal-fired electricity cheaper than renewables. Although the recently passed Presidential Regulation No.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8445):**
> Carbon pricing   Indonesia launched the first Emissions Trading System (ETS) in Southeast Asia in February 2023, and the government expects to transform it into a hybrid ‘cap-tax-and-trade’ system by 2025. - The first operational phase (2023-2024) covers on-grid coal plants of 100 MW or larger. - In the second phase (2025-2027), it will expand to on-grid coal plants with capacity below 25 MW, off-grid coal plants, gas-fired power plants, and combined cycled power plants.
