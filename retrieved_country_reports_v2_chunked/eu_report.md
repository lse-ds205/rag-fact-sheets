### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8120):**
> The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios. - **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8461):**
> Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition. Our planned policies projections of 2,370–2,400 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) reflects the EU’s 2030 indicative renewable energy goal (of a further 2.5%, totalling 45%) as well as policy proposals that have been announced but remain to be adopted, most notably is the Energy Taxation Directive.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8287):**
> The revised Energy Efficiency Directive sets a binding target to reduce the final energy consumption by 11.7% relative to the 2020 or a target of 763 Mtoe of final energy consumption by 2030 across all sectors (European Parliament, 2023). The EED lacks robust measures specifically targeting the building sector, focusing instead on general improvements in energy efficiency and renovation rates linked to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As of early 2024, no updated NECP submissions from member states fully comply with EED requirements, revealing a concerning lack of commitment.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8315):**
> The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios. - **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8011):**
> However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b). - **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a).
