       "'Achieving a substantial decarbonization of the energy sector will require major efforts in the building sectors. At EU level, greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector represent more than a third of total emissions. Residential buildings account for 75 % of the European building stock, from which more than 40 % was built before 1960 and more than 90 % before 1990. Low income households represent about 17 % of households in the EU (Eurostat, 2014), while estimates of EU-inhabitants suffering from fuel poverty ranging between 50-160 million inhabitants, corresponding to roughly 6-21 % of the total EU-population (Bouzarovski (2014); BPIE (2015); Bird et al. (2010)). Energy efficiency policies in the residential sector bear great potential to improve the disposable income of households. Disposable household incomes can be increased by improved EE in space heating, hot water generation or energy- using products like fridges or televisions, given that the overwhelming share of all implemented measures are cost-effective (Yushchenko and Patel 2017; Dodoo et al. 2017). Derived from this, EE bears a great potential for the alleviation of energy poverty, but additionally induce the multiple benefits of EE, such as improving human health, lowering energy subsidies through social policies, increased the value of properties, local spending and employment, reduced emissions, etc. Initial investments in EE for renovation of buildings usually pay off in terms of heating cost reduction, which enables consumers to spend their money elsewhere in the long run. However, as the evaluation of the German KfW Energy-efficient Refurbishment Programme emphasizes, it must be noted that these investments are profitable after a period of several decades (KfW Group (2018)). Disregarding investment costs is hence a simplification and likewise the neglect of rebound and spill-over effects.'"

    "Sample results are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From Boolean search: 'Achieving a substantial decarbonization of the energy sector will require major efforts in the building sectors. At EU level, greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector represent more than a third of total emissions. Residential buildings account for 75 % of the European building stock, from which more than 40 % was built before 1960 and more than 90 % before 1990. Low income households represent about 17 % of households in the EU (Eurostat, 2014), while estimates of EU-inhabitants suffering from fuel poverty ranging between 50-160 million inhabitants, corresponding to roughly 6-21 % of the total EU-population (Bouzarovski (2014); BPIE (2015); Bird et al. (2010)). Energy efficiency policies in the residential sector bear great potential to improve the disposable income of households. Disposable household incomes can be increased by improved EE in space heating, hot water generation or energy- using products like fridges or televisions, given that the overwhelming share of all implemented measures are cost-effective (Yushchenko and Patel 2017; Dodoo et al. 2017). Derived from this, EE bears a great potential for the alleviation of energy poverty, but additionally induce the multiple benefits of EE, such as improving human health, lowering energy subsidies through social policies, increased the value of properties, local spending and employment, reduced emissions, etc. Initial investments in EE for renovation of buildings usually pay off in terms of heating cost reduction, which enables consumers to spend their money elsewhere in the long run. However, as the evaluation of the German KfW Energy-efficient Refurbishment Programme emphasizes, it must be noted that these investments are profitable after a period of several decades (KfW Group (2018)). Disregarding investment costs is hence a simplification and likewise the neglect of rebound and spill-over effects.'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From BM25: \"BiH is working on the project 'Advance the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process for medium-term investment planning in climate sensitive sectors in Bosnia-Herzegovina'. The project will support BiH to advance the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process and reach goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From Fuzzy string: \"BiH has demonstrated its commitment to participate in global efforts aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change by signing the Paris Agreement. As a contribution to the fulfilment of the Paris Agreement, it adopted the document 'Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)' for the period until 2030.

    "\n",
    "Upon manual interpretation, it seems that Fuzzy String Matching results are most relevant, with explicitly mentions Paris Agreement multiple times, references \"National Adaptation Plan (NAP)\" and \"Adaptation to Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Strategy\" and shows concrete goals (2% unconditional, 3% conditional GHG reduction by 2030) and references INDCs and strategic documents. BM25 also retrieve relevant chunks that mentions Paris Agreement mention, references National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and demonstrate hows ongoing project work. Boolean search, on the pother hand produces the poorest retrieval, though it is not totally out of context."

       "'The forecasted changes in precipitation and air temperature will negatively affect the current water resources management system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or both its entities and BD. Changes can be expected in terms of time of occurrence, frequency and intensity of extreme events - floods and droughts. The largest increase in air temperature is predicted in the vegetation period (June, July and August), and a slightly milder increase during March, April and May, which will result in increased evapotranspiration and more pronounced extreme minimums of water levels in watercourses. This will result in a general reduction in the availability of water resources in the vegetation period when the needs are greatest, in terms of water quantity, but also quality, because in low water periods the potential and real danger of significant water quality degradation increases (in which untreated municipal and other wastewaters dominate, such as in the summer in the Miljacka River in Sarajevo). Groundwater resources are also becoming increasingly endangered, which is especially dangerous for the supply of drinking water, which in BiH absolutely predominantly relies on this resource. Excessive exploitation, in addition to quantitative problems, means insufficient renewal of underground reservoirs during the rainy season, leading to problems with the quality of these waters, which (except chlorination) are largely untreated, and increased abstraction can lead to the withdrawal of hazardous pollutants outside protection zones, or the periphery of the original funnel-shaped depressions, or unexpectedly large distances, in the case of karst. A significant increase in air temperature during the winter season (December, January and February) will result in a decrease in snowfall, or a decrease in flow in most watercourses in the spring months. On the other hand, the expected more frequent precipitation of higher intensity will cause greater runoff, often accompanied by floods.'"
