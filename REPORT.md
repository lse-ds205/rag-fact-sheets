## 🔧 Design Decisions

The following sub-sections reflect the various **design decisions** we undertook in this project. These decisions were made intentionally, after careful consideration of alternatives and documentation under our research folder.

> **Performance Levers**: In terms of performance, we saw the following key levers to improving the accuracy of the results:
> - Embedding Strategy
> - RAG Strategy  
> - Similarity Search & Retrieval Strategy

### 🏛️ Project Architecture

#### **Database: PostgreSQL Database hosted on Supabase**
* **Rationale**: Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL with built-in vector extensions (`pgvector`) for efficient similarity search, while offering seamless integration with our JavaScript/Python stack and real-time capabilities for monitoring document updates.

#### **Backend: Classic RAG + hopRAG**

* **Problem Statement**: The main issue with classic RAG strategies is that it suffers from **multi-hop reasoning failures** ([Reference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12442))
* **Root Cause**: For complicated questions we require information from multiple chunks to fully answer a question and your RAG fails because it cannot make connections from chunks
* **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - `Graph RAG` vs `hop RAG` 
* **Final Decision**: **Hop RAG** is more computationally efficient because it avoids the `O(n²)` complexity of comparing relationships between all chunks that Graph RAG requires. With `~100k chunks` from our PDF processing, Graph RAG would create prohibitive computational overhead, while hop RAG maintains **linear scaling** by selectively exploring relevant connection paths.

For more details on RAG architecture, please refer to the `RAG.MD` markdown file.

#### **Front-end: Email + API**
* **Purpose**: Updates user (meeting client's need as per request) whenever a change is detected and redirecting them to a front-end for a more custom UX

#### **Server: GitHub Actions for initial deployment**
* **Current**: Daily scraping to check if the website has any updates
* **Future Work**: Can be improved for production deployment
* **Rationale**: GitHub Actions provides cost-effective scheduled workflows with integrated version control, enabling automated daily monitoring without additional infrastructure costs while maintaining deployment consistency.

#### **Email APIs & Domain: Resend API + Zoho Mail**
* **Rationale**: 
  - `Resend` offers reliable transactional email delivery with developer-friendly APIs and high deliverability rates
  - `Zoho Mail` provides professional domain email hosting with robust spam filtering and integration capabilities for client communications

### 🧠 Embedding Strategy

We shared our learnings from **PSET #2** and concluded that a strategy that combines `word2vec` and `transformer embeddings` works the best.

For transformer embeddings we looked at both `climate-bert-f` model and compared it against other climate embedding models on Huggingface. We concluded that this was the **best model currently** for climate related text. 

> **Additional Research**: We also considered the use of `colBERT` and documented a comparison between these 2 embedding models under `research/NB01 - Embeddings`.

| Aspect | **Climate-BERT-F** | **ColBERT** |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Core idea** | Domain-specific language model: `DistilRoBERTa` fine-tuned on >2M climate-related paragraphs (research abstracts, corporate & news reports) | "Late-interaction" retrieval: every token in a passage is stored as a separate vector; at query time ColBERT matches query-token vectors to passage-token vectors with a `MaxSim` operator |
| **Architecture / size** | `DistilRoBERTa-base` (≈82M parameters) that produces a single `768-d vector` per text (mean-pooling by default) | `BERT-base` encoder (≈110M parameters) that outputs `32- to 128-dimensional` token vectors; the collection therefore indexes many vectors per passage |
| **Training focus** | Continued pre-training ("FULL-SELECT" corpus) to capture **climate vocabulary and semantics**; not specialised for retrieval | Supervised on the `MS MARCO Passage-Ranking` task (and related corpora), so it excels at **open-domain web‐scale retrieval** tasks |
| **Strengths** | • **Out-of-the-box climate terminology coverage**, making it well-suited for classification, clustering or similarity tasks within ESG/climate documents<br>• **Compact single-vector output** integrates easily with any vector DB | • **Very high recall and MRR** on passage-ranking benchmarks (e.g., ≥0.38 MRR@10 on MS MARCO dev)<br>• **Scales to billions of passages** with PLAID/FAISS-IVF indexes while preserving quality |
| **Trade-offs** | • General-domain retrieval quality **lags behind** ColBERT-style approaches<br>• Performance gains are **domain-specific**; outside climate text it behaves like a mid-size DistilRoBERTa encoder | • Embeddings are **multi-vector**, so ColBERT cannot be scored on single-vector leaderboards such as MTEB without adaptation<br>• **Larger index footprint** and slightly slower query latency than single-vector models |

### 🔍 RAG Strategy

From our literature review, we came across **3 different RAG structures**: `classic RAG`, `tree-structured RAG` and `graph RAG`. We debated the pros and cons of each of these structures:

| Strategy | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Climate Document Context** |
|----------|------|------|-------------------------|
| **Classic RAG** | • Simple implementation<br>• Fast retrieval<br>• Low computational overhead | • **Poor multi-hop reasoning**<br>• Limited context awareness<br>• Struggles with complex queries | ❌ *Insufficient for NDC analysis requiring cross-referencing between targets, policies, and timelines* |
| **Tree-Structured RAG** | • Hierarchical organization<br>• Better for structured documents<br>• Moderate computational cost | • **Rigid structure assumptions**<br>• Limited cross-branch connections<br>• Complex tree construction | ❌ *Climate documents don't follow consistent hierarchical patterns across countries* |
| **Graph RAG** | • **Excellent relationship modeling**<br>• Superior multi-hop reasoning<br>• Rich contextual understanding | • **O(n²) complexity** for 100k chunks<br>• High memory requirements<br>• Complex implementation | ❌ *Computationally prohibitive for our 100k chunk dataset with limited resources* |

#### 🤔 Initial Considerations & Pivot

In our initial discussions above, we explored the idea of attempting various embedding strategies, for example on top of transformer and word2vec we could explore different embedding techniques to create a more robust solution. 

> **Critical Reflection**: However, we reflected on this and believed that doing so would severely increase the **cyclomatic complexity** of the project with only marginal gains. Hence, we opted for a **leaner methodology** to completely reframe our approach to this problem.

#### 🚀 **Introducing hopRAG**

**HopRAG Optimal Strategy**: HopRAG provides the **multi-hop reasoning capabilities** of Graph RAG while maintaining **linear computational complexity** by selectively exploring only the most relevant connection paths. This approach is particularly suited for climate documents where answers often require synthesizing information from **2-3 related sections** rather than complex graph traversals.

### 📊 Top K Chunks

We examined the use of different methodologies to improve the retrieval of the **top K chunks**. In our `PSET #2` we used `cosine similarity + keyword boosting` to obtain better results. But we weren't satisfied there. 

> **Literature Review Insight**: Upon reviewing literature, we realized that such methodology was a mini version of **BM25+ similarity search (hybrid search)**. This would perform both **lexical and semantic search** and combines both `TFIDF scoring` and `cosine similarity search`.

We explored the use of this in combination with **Fuzzy Regex**:

#### 🧩 **Fuzzy Regex Enhancement**

Our Fuzzy Regex implementation adds an additional layer of validation beyond traditional similarity search by implementing sophisticated text matching techniques:

* **N-gram Analysis** 🔍 - Breaks text into overlapping chunks (n-grams) to identify partial matches even when terminology varies
* **Contextual Pattern Recognition** 🧠 - Uses domain-specific regex patterns tailored to climate policy language, including:
  * Mitigation patterns (e.g., `reduction in emissions`, `carbon neutral`)
  * Adaptation patterns (e.g., `resilience to climate`, `disaster management`)
  * Finance patterns (e.g., `$X million for climate`, `green bonds`)
  * Target patterns (e.g., `by 2030`, `X% reduction`)
* **Similarity Ratio Calculation** 📊 - Employs the Sequence Matcher algorithm to calculate text similarity scores between 0 and 1
* **Confidence Thresholding** ⚖️ - Configurable threshold (default: 0.6) determines minimum similarity for fuzzy matches

This approach significantly improves retrieval quality for climate policy documents by capturing **semantic equivalence** even when exact keywords aren't present. For example, a query about "emissions reduction targets" will match content discussing "commitment to lower greenhouse gas output by 2030" despite minimal lexical overlap.

---

### 🤖 LLM Prompt Engineering 

> **Key Insight**: Unlike traditional RAG tasks that will probably require cross documentation referencing, for our task, the result will only be found in **1 document** – the latest country NDC document.

Our prompt engineering strategy follows a systematic **four-stage approach**:

#### 1. **🎯 Prompt Matching & Keyword Enhancement**
Based on our **domain expertise**, we created a comprehensive keyword mapping system (`HOP_KEYWORDS`) that connects each question type to climate-specific terminology:

```python
# Example from prompts.py
HOP_KEYWORDS = {
    # Question 1: Emissions reduction targets
    1: [
        "reduction target", "emissions target", "reduce emissions", 
        "GHG emissions", "carbon emissions", "target of", "reduction of",
        "% reduction", "unconditional target", "conditional target",
        // ...more keywords...
    ],
    // ...other questions...
}
```

This mapping enhances retrieval by:
- Boosting documents containing domain-specific terminology
- Enabling better multi-hop reasoning through related concepts
- Improving performance for specialized climate policy questions

> **Implementation**: The keyword mapping is used in the retrieval phase to enhance document chunks before they reach the LLM, ensuring that relevant terminology is properly weighted.

#### 2. **📝 Answer Generator**
**Actual implemented prompt clauses**:
* *"Provide a comprehensive answer based ONLY on the information in the provided chunks"*
* *"Include ALL chunks that contributed to your answer"*
* *"Be precise and factual - do not add information not present in the chunks"*
* **Decoding parameters**: `temperature = 0.1` (configurable via environment variables)

> **Purpose**: These constraints help reduce hallucinations by ensuring the LLM only uses information from the provided context chunks. The implementation allows for flexible configuration through environment variables rather than hardcoding parameters.

---

## 🔄 Methodology

We used a systematic **four-step methodology** as outlined below:

### Step 1: 🕷️ Document Monitoring & Ingestion
* **Web Scraping**: `Selenium-based bot` monitors UNFCCC website daily for new NDC submissions, bypassing HCaptcha restrictions
* **Document Processing**: Automated PDF extraction, text cleaning, and metadata extraction for newly detected documents
* **Quality Assurance**: Validation checks ensure document completeness and format consistency before processing

#### 🤖 Selenium Bot Methodology

Our Selenium-based web scraper employs a sophisticated approach to monitor the UNFCCC NDC registry:

1. **HCaptcha Bypass**: Utilizes a headless browser with randomized user agent strings and timing variations to appear as human traffic
2. **Document Identification**: Extracts metadata (country, submission date, document type) from the NDC registry listings
3. **Database Verification**: For each identified document, performs a check against the PostgreSQL database:
   ```python
   SELECT EXISTS(
     SELECT 1 FROM documents 
     WHERE doc_id = :doc_id OR 
           (country = :country AND filename = :filename)
   )
   ```
4. **Efficient Processing**:
   * If document exists in database → Skip processing
   * If new document → Download to temporary storage at `data/pdf` on the GitHub runner
   * Document naming convention assumption: Countries upload new NDC versions with distinct filenames
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Captures critical metadata during scraping:
   * Country name and ISO code
   * Submission timestamp
   * Language identifier
   * Original filename

This approach ensures we only process genuinely new submissions, optimizing computational resources while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the NDC registry.

### Step 2: ✂️ Text Processing & Chunking
* **Preprocessing**: Remove headers, footers, and non-content elements while preserving document structure
* **Smart Chunking**: Context-aware chunking that maintains semantic coherence, targeting `512-token chunks` with `50-token overlap`
* **Chunk Indexing**: Each chunk receives unique identifiers and metadata tags for efficient retrieval and citation

### Step 3: 🧠 Embedding & Vector Storage
* **Hybrid Embedding**: Combine `Climate-BERT-F` transformer embeddings with `word2vec` representations for optimal domain coverage
* **Vector Database**: Store embeddings in Supabase PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension for efficient similarity search
* **HopRAG Relationship Detection**: Automatically detect logical relationships between chunks using semantic similarity and pattern matching
  * **Node Classification**: Classify chunks into four distinct categories based on graph centrality measures:
    * `CORE_HUB`: Nodes with high scores in at least 2 centrality measures - critical knowledge centers
    * `AUTHORITY`: Nodes with high PageRank but not qualifying as Core Hub - influential reference points
    * `CONNECTOR`: Nodes with high betweenness centrality - important bridge nodes between topics
    * `PERIPHERAL`: Nodes with lower centrality scores - supporting information content
  * **Relationship Scoring**: Assign confidence scores to relationships based on semantic similarity, pattern strength, and distance penalties
### Step 4: 🔍 Query Processing & Fact-Sheet Generation
* **Query Analysis**: Parse incoming questions and apply domain-specific keyword mapping for enhanced retrieval
* **HopRAG Retrieval**: Execute multi-hop reasoning across retrieved chunks to synthesize comprehensive answers
* **Fact-Sheet Generation**: Format validated responses into standardized `JSON/PDF` outputs with confidence scores
