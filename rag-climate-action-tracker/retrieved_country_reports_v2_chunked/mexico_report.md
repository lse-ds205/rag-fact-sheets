## Country: Mexico

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8408):**
> For years 2020 and 2021, we estimate emissions based on a sectoral approach. For the energy and industry sectors we assume a correlation between emissions and GDP, and thus apply economic growth forecasts from the IMF (IMF, 2022). For agriculture and waste sectors, we extend the last five years of pre-COVID historic trend.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8148):**
> Due to the lack of details on the contribution of the forestry and land use sector in the updated climate targets, we consider a range between assumptions. See the Assumptions section for more details. 1Mexico includes electricity generation through fossil gas efficient cogeneration of as part of its definition of ‘clean energies’.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8169):**
> Its plans for the power sector stand in stark contrast to what is required to achieve the 1.5°C limit. The Mexican government’s decisions also bring into question whether it will achieve its clean energy targets under the 2015 Energy Transition Law (LTE, in Spanish) , and General Climate Change Law: 25% of electricity generation in 2018, 30% in 2021, and 35% in 2024 (Ley de Transición Energética, 2015). With 23.2% of clean generation, the LTE’s 2018 goal of 25% was not achieved (SENER, 2020).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8093):**
> This regulation establishes the allowance of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs)—from CDM projects in Mexico—as well as Green Certified Emission Reductions—in the EU ETS—as payment means under the carbon tax (REGLAS de Carácter General Para El Pago Opcional Del Impuesto Especial Sobre Producción y Servicios a Los Combustibles Fósiles Mediante La Entrega de Los Bonos de Carbono., 2017; World Bank Group and Ecofys, 2018). In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The General Climate Change Law was amended later that year – and approved in 2018 by the Mexican Senate – to make the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes.
