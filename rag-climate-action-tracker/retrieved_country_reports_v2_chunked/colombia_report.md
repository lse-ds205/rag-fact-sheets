## Country: Colombia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8077):**
> CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to required domestic efforts, and "Almost sufficient” compared to Colombia’s fair share. Colombia has a net zero target and has submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. Both the NDC and net zero targets are enshrined in law.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8334):**
> The CAT indicates that to be compatible with the 1.5°C limit, cement production needs to reduce its emissions intensity to zero by 2050, (Climate Action Tracker, 2020). The cement sector in Colombia is still far from this zero-emissions trajectory. No target is yet set for electrifying the Colombian industrial sector.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8060):**
> The rest of the planned 11.2 MtCO2e energy sector mitigation target for 2030 is to be made up through increased energy efficiency in buildings and industry, reducing fugitive emissions from power plants and reducing overall energy demand (Gobierno de Colombia, 2020a; MinMinas & Gobierno de Colombia, 2018). In an effort to strengthen the nation’s commitment towards power decarbonisation, the Colombian Ministry of Energy signed an agreement with eight energy companies to reach carbon neutrality in Colombia’s electricity sector by 2050 (MinEnergía Colombia, 2020). While this is a step in the right direction, it is likely not fast enough to be 1.5°C compatible, as global benchmarks indicate that national power sectors would need to be decarbonised by 2030, with a coal phase-out by 2040 for developing countries.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8210):**
> While this is a step in the right direction, it is likely not fast enough to be 1.5°C compatible, as global benchmarks indicate that national power sectors would need to be decarbonised by 2030, with a coal phase-out by 2040 for developing countries. A stronger message from the government, such as a concrete phase-out date for coal in the power sector, would certainly help progress and incentivise investors to move away from the resource. Ecopetrol has committed to achieving net zero CO2 emissions for its own emissions (direct and indirect sources) by 2050 and a 50% reduction in all emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by the same date.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7964):**
> In December 2021, with the Law No. 2169 (Ley Climatica N°2169, 2021), Colombia promotes the country's low-carbon development through the establishment of minimum targets and measures for carbon neutrality and climate resilience. This enriches the carbon neutrality target into law.
