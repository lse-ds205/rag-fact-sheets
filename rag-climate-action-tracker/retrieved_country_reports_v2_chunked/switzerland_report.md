## Country: Switzerland

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8217):**
>  ## Summary   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**. Switzerland committed to a net zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2021. With the new Climate Protection Act (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023) which passed in June 2023, Switzerland became the first country to enshrine its net zero target in law through a public referendum.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8205):**
> ## Transparency   Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets. Switzerland's second NDC is based on fixed values for emission reductions compared to 1990 values.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8271):**
> The **Energy Strategy 2050** became the key framework in the energy sector when it replaced the previous Energy law. The energy strategy withstood a public referendum in 2017 and contains a package of measures aiming at increasing energy efficiency, reduction of CO2 emissions, and steadily replacing nuclear energy with renewables (Bundesamt für Energie, 2018a). To execute the strategy, Switzerland revised its **Energy Act** (EnG) and set targets for the expansion of electricity production from renewable energy for 2020 and 2035.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8288):**
> ## Ambition   For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. Switzerland’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target. Switzerland’s 2035 NDC target is more ambitious than its 2030 target, aiming for a 65% reduction compared to a 50% reduction below1990 levels.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7954):**
> The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies (see below) is set out to address this to some extent. Switzerland introduced a carbon levy charged on fossil fuels in 2008, which covers ~35% of CO2 emissions. The fee was repeatedly raised over time, culminating at CHF 120 per tonne of CO2 (USD 130) in 2022, making it the highest CO2 levy in Europe (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, 2021) (Alex Mengden, 2024).
