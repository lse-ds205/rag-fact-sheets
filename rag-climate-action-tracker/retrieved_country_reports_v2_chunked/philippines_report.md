### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8349):**
> Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C. Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8134):**
> - Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development. The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8012):**
> Now, we rate the government's targets and policies (and provision of climate finance where relevant) against both fairness metrics and the level of emission reductions needed within the country to achieve 1.5°C. Under the old approach, we normally based our ratings on the top end of an unconditional target. In instances where a country did not have an unconditional target, we would rate their conditional target, but downgrade the rating by one category due to this conditionality.
