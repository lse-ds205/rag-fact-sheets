### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8255):**
> We have also excluded LULUCF-related mitigation measures from the long list of mitigation measures used to determine the mitigation target. In this update, the CAT also excluded the LULUCF-related mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. ## Current policy projections   Current policy projections are based on BAU emissions projections and the mitigation potential provided in the Third Biennial Update Report (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022b) and the Fourth National Communication (Kingdom of Morocco, 2022a).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8277):**
> The National Energy Efficiency Strategy also targets the agricultural sector (together with maritime fishing), and aims for 13.5% energy consumption reduction by 2030 (Kingdom of Morocco, 2020b).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8153):**
> **Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   In its LTS, the Moroccan government stated its intention to provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century. Therefore, we assume that Morocco intends to commit to a net zero target (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7778):**
> First, both the unconditional and conditional 2030 emissions reduction targets were revised to be more ambitious—from 17% to 18.3% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario for the unconditional target and from 42% to 45.5% for the conditional one. Morocco also revised downwards the BAU scenario, to which the reduction targets are applied. For the unconditional target, this leads to 21% lower emissions (excl.
