### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8351):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The US government reserves its right to use international market mechanisms towards the achievement of this net zero goal (U.S. Department of State, 2021), even if it currently does not expect to do so. - **Legal status** – The US government submitted its updated long-term strategy (LTS) including its net zero announcement to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The net zero target has not yet been enshrined in law as of November 2024.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8568):**
> **See full summary of** **policies and actions here****. **   We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8355):**
> In total, the revised standards for these products will reduce household and business energy costs by USD 8.7bn per year. The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US and federal buildings are a principal source of the government’s emissions (Council on Environmental Quality, 2024). In April 2024, the DOE amended its energy performance standards for the new construction and renovation of federal buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024b).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8378):**
> The NDC claims the 2035 target is fully aligned with its net zero pathway; it argues that “the entire 2035 range is on a straight line or steeper trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 for all greenhouse gases.” To achieve its net zero target, the CAT estimates the US needs to reduce emissions to 558–1,540 MtCO2e or 80-93% below 2005 levels in 2050, excluding LULUCF. Assuming the US realises its 2030 NDC target, the 2035 NDC target is aligned with the median net zero pathway, but not the pathway’s uppermost bound. Further information on the US net zero target can be found here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8072):**
> Overall, the US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development technologies thar are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.
