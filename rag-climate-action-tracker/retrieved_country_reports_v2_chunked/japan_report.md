### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8102):**
> The net zero target is included in the Japan’s Long-term Strategy. - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Japan provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets. - **Review process** – Japan has a legally-binding process under the Promotion Act to review the progress up to 2030 towards the net zero target in 2050 but reviewing the net zero target itself is not legally-bound as it is not enshrined in a law but only stipulated in policy documents.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8202):**
> For this reason, we assumed that GHG emissions will balance LULUCF sinks in 2050. We estimate the LULUCF sink for 2050 to be 28–61 MtCO2e using a 10-years historical average between 2009–2019 (upper bound estimate) and a 10-years trend projection towards 2030 based on the period between 2009–2019 that we keep constant towards 2050 (lower bound estimate). ## Current policy projections   For the analysis of current policy projections, we used the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2023 Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) as a basis (IEA, 2023).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8084):**
> (2022b). Cabinet Decision on the Bill for the Act of Partial Revision of the Act on the Rationalization etc. of Energy Use and Other Acts in Order to Establish Stable Energy Supply and Demand Structure.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8518):**
> This assumes a linear trajectory between Japan’s 2030 NDC target and the 2050 net zero target. While not yet officially endorsed or submitted by the Japanese government, this proposed 2035 target would significantly fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. Recent analysis by the Climate Action Tracker finds a reduction of at least 81% by 2035 below 2013 would be needed in order to be compatible with 1.5°C-aligned domestic emission reduction pathways (see figure below).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8354):**
> The first tranche of these bonds was auctioned in February 2024 (MoF, 2024). Details on the overall system have yet to be announced, but the carbon levy is expected to be set at around JPY 1,500 /t-CO2, which is seen as too low to be effective (Climate Integrate, 2023). Research shows that with a carbon price set at JPY 3,300/t-CO2, new solar PV energy and onshore wind power generation would outcompete coal-fired power generation (Carbon Tracker, 2022).
