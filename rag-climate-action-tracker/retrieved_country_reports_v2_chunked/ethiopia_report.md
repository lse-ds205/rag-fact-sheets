## Country: Ethiopia

---
### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8154):**
>  ## Summary   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**. Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8324):**
> To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7986):**
> As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved. ## Energy supply   Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7991):**
>  ## Summary   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**. Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7847):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). **Target architecture**   - **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015).
