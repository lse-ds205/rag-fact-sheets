### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8376):**
>  ## Summary   We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor. **   Brazil aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission (Government of Brazil, 2023b). However, no further details on the scope, architecture and transparency have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8442):**
> This target covers all sectors and all gases. According to the latest national inventory data for 2005, this is consistent with an emissions level between 832–1,033 MtCO2e in 2035 (in AR4 GWPs, incl. LULUCF).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8370):**

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8005):**
> Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the – still significant – emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop. According to our latest assessment, Brazil’s total emissions (excl.
