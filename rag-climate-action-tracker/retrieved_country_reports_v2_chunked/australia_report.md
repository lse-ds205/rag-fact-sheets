## Country: Australia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8458):**
> ## Net zero target   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**   Australia included its target to achieve net zero by 2050 in its updated NDCs in October 2021 and June 2022. The 2022 Climate Change Act enshrined the 2050 target in the law. Australia is preparing a new Net Zero Plan.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8663):**
> The government has repeatedly revised emissions projections downwards. This has typically not been backed by stronger climate policies but is rather the result of a change in assumptions. The government has set an emissions reductions target of 43% below 2005 levels including LULUCF.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8502):**
> Power sector emissions have been declining since 2016, with this trend expected to continue as renewable energy displaces fossil fuels (DCCEEW, 2023b). The government’s main policies for the power sector are the 82% renewable electricity target and the expanded Capacity Investment Scheme, both discussed in the Renewables section below. There is no explicit emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector, nor a federal-level coal and gas phase-out plan and timeline.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8369):**
> The ‘with additional measures’ scenario includes the 82% renewable electricity target by 2030 for the country’s grids, but not the expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme announced in November 2023, which is not included in either government scenario (DCCEEW, 2023b). ## Net-zero target and other long-term targets   We use the most recent available update of the Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan as a basis for assessing Australia’s climate trajectory to 2050. The government is currently preparing an update of the 2050 Net Zero Roadmap.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8022):**
> The government’s support of the fossil fuel industry hinges on false solutions such as its support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and offsets. According to the IEA, no new fossil fuel projects are required in its Net Zero Emissions scenario, which reaches net zero emissions by mid-century in a way that limits global warming to 1.5°C, consistent with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. While the government’s expanded Capacity Investment Scheme demonstrates its commitment to its 82% renewable electricity target for 2030, many barriers to renewable energy projects remain.
