## Country: Costa Rica

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8469):**
> ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   **We evaluate the net zero target as Acceptable. **   Costa Rica announced a net zero target for 2050 in its National Decarbonisation Plan 2018-2050 (Government of Costa Rica, 2019c). The net zero target covers most key elements but does not meet best practice standards for some of them.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8699):**
> - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The National Decarbonisation Plan does not explicitly set separate reduction and removal targets. However, the Plan estimates sectoral emissions by 2050. Energy, industrial processes, agriculture, and waste are estimated to emit 5.5 MtCO2e and the LULUCF sector to remove net 5.5 MtCO2e.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8117):**
> The overarching strategy driving climate policy in the power sector is the VII National Energy Plan 2015-2030, which supports the continuation of renewable energy development, improving energy efficiency, diversifying and decentralising energy generation, and the electrification of fossil fuel-reliant sectors. The aspirational goal of the plan was to achieve and sustain 100% of electricity generation coming from renewable energy by 2021 (Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía, 2015c). While this target was technically achieved, it has not been sustained.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8479):**
> ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   **We evaluate the net zero target as Acceptable. **   Costa Rica announced a net zero target for 2050 in its National Decarbonisation Plan 2018-2050 (Government of Costa Rica, 2019c). The net zero target covers most key elements but does not meet best practice standards for some of them.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8014):**
> Costa Rica’s electrified rail projects have stalled and have scaled back their efforts to fully electrify, and modal shift has also been slow. Efforts to enshrine the fossil fuel moratorium into law have also faced challenges from the current administration. Costa Rica’s most important climate policy is its National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP) (Government of Costa Rica, 2019c), which sets out decarbonisation policies and actions across all relevant sectors of the economy.
