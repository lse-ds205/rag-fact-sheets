### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8445):**
> It sets LULUCF emissions targets of -9.2 and -0.7 MtCO2 by 2050 for the WAM and WEM scenarios, respectively. The LTS does not specify the role of carbon removal in its carbon neutrality scenarios. - **Review process** – The implementation of the targets will be evaluated against performance indicators compatible with national targets.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8291):**
> Nepal launched the National Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2019. It consists of action plans to achieve its main goal of doubling the average improvement rate of energy efficiency in Nepal from 0.84% per year (in 2000 -2015) to 1.68% per year in 2030 (Government of Nepal, 2019). However, Nepal currently still has no standards, guidelines or regulations related to energy efficient building construction nor applications for existing buildings (European Union, 2022).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8540):**
> ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average. **   Nepal announced its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality before, or by, 2045, in October 2021. The long-term strategy sets out targets that cover all sectors of the economy – energy, industry process, agriculture, forestry and land use, and waste.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8145):**
> It is also unclear to what extent the government will rely on CDR technology and which scenario the government is committed to achieving. The scenarios above are national scenarios. However, the government argues that it is feasible to achieve net zero emissions sooner than 2045 through cross-border energy trade.
