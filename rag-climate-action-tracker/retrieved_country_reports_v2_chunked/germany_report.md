### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8392):**
> - Buildings, Industry, Agriculture and Waste: no adjustments, using scenario with implemented measures. ## Net-zero target and other long-term targets   According to Germany’s Climate Law, the 2045 climate neutrality target includes a sink of 40 MtCO2e to compensate for some remaining emissions sources. We thus estimate the total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF in 2045 at 40 MtCO2e.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8380):**
> Before it changed the requirement, the ministry failed to submit emergency programmes for the three years in which the sector overshot its emissions target. - **Comply with own 65% renewables target in building sector**: the government had agreed in its coalition contract and thereafter on the ambitious goal that, as of 2024, all new heating systems would use 65% renewable energy. However, an intensive debate emerged, particularly around a ban on new fossil fuel heating systems.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8464):**
>  ## Summary   We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**. In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law and submitted its updated LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2022. The net zero target generally covers all key elements but fails to meet good practice as defined by the Climate Action Tracker for some of them.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8255):**
> Companies selling fossil fuels have to purchase certificates for the carbon content of those fuels, and pass on the additional financial burden to the end consumers through an increased price. The scheme started in 2021 with an initial price of EUR 25 per tonne of CO2. It was meant to increase annually, but in 2022 the government postponed the increase because of the high energy prices driven by the illegal invasion of Russia in Ukraine.
