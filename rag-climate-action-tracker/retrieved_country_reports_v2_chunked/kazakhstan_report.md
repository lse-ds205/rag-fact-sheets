## Country: Kazakhstan

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8138):**
> **Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****. **    ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)   We evaluate the net zero target as: “Average”. Kazakhstan first announced its intention to reach “carbon neutrality” by 2060 during the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8393):**
> ## Current policy projections   Current policy projections stem from the “with measures” scenario from the Fifth Biennial Report. We harmonise this scenario to historical emissions reported in the latest country inventory using growth rates. The “with measures” scenario includes measures and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that have been taken or are planned to be adopted in the near future.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8356):**
> In the power sector, shares of renewable energy – excluding old hydro-power plants – reached 4.5% in 2023, on track with the government's modest targets. Similarly, energy efficiency policies have contributed to a declining trend in the economy's emissions intensity. However, the balance between policies that support emissions growth and those supporting mitigation remains skewed to the former.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8227):**
> Kazakhstan could consider carbon pricing to cover all sectors, enhancing stringency through increasing the carbon price while lowering the emissions cap, and improving the credibility of the system through more predictable planning and more robust MRV. In its fifth Biennial Report to the UNFCCC (2022), government mentions a carbon tax for sectors not covered by the ETS in its scenario “With Additional Measures” scenario. However, the indicative price level used is rather low: starting at USD 2 per ton of CO2-eq and increasing at USD 2 increments up to 2030 (to USD 16) and at USD 2.5 up to 2035 (to USD 29).
