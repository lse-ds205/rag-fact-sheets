> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8120): The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-spec


## Sector Targets

- **Answer**: `yes`

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8461): Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition. Our planned pol
