> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8270): LULUCF). Our conservative scenario expects China’s emissions to peak before 2025, followed by a slight annual decline of 0.5% for the rest of the decade. An optimistic scenario, with accelerated renewable deployment and coal phase-down, suggests CO2 emissions co


## Efficiency Target

- **Answer**: `soft_yes`

- **Explanation**: Mentions energy efficiency themes, but no clear policy or target.

- **Year(s)**: 2010

- **Sector(s)**: Energy, Power

- **Confidence**: 0.8036

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8045): This projection, based on the median value of conservative and optimistic estimates from the two most binding energy-related NDC targets (peaking and carbon intensity targets), represents a 28% increase from 2010 levels. The country’s existing policies are set t


## Electricity Net Zero

- **Answer**: `no`

- **Explanation**: None

- **Year(s)**: 2023, 2024, 2030, 2050

- **Sector(s)**: Electricity, Energy, Power

- **Confidence**: 0.859

- **Source URL**: https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/policies-action/

> Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8548): To be compatible with a 1.5°C pathway, China would need to have shares of renewable electricity generation reach at least 79% in 2030; It stood at only 31% in 2023 (NBS of China, 2024). Globally, all countries will need to have 95–100% renewable electricity shar


## Carbon Pricing

- **Answer**: `no`

- **Explanation**: None

- **Year(s)**: 2035

- **Sector(s)**: Energy

- **Confidence**: 0.7874
