    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Germany’s recent climate policies and its weak economy moved emissions projections significantly downwards, but the three-party coalition government remains divided on comprehensive action across all sectors, leaving the country’s climate targets in danger. Climate action varies drastically within and across sectors. The government, which will remain in power until September 2025, needs to actively engage in climate action across all sectors** **to ensure that its 2030 target is achieved and its 2045 net zero target remains within reach, while securing and safeguarding social acceptance of the transition. The CAT rates Germany’s climate action as “Insufficient”.**\n",
    "The government is in real danger of failing to reach its 2030 target, even if the official government projections claim the target will be met in aggregate. The official projections are very optimistic as they assume the 80% renewable electricity target will be met, CO2 prices remain high, and emission-intensive industry activity remains low. Recent capacity additions for wind are not at all in line with the renewables goal and CO2 prices are now lower than assumed. The government therefore needs to remain active to ensure that its own target is safely met.\n",
    "Not only does the government need to meet its 2030 target, it needs to raise its ambition, as it is still not 1.5˚C compatible. Given the 2023 Global Stocktake’s recognition of the need for all countries to reassess and enhance their level of climate ambition and action, Germany, through the Paris Agreement, is obliged to reinforce its 2030 ambition level. The way the government plans to meet the 2030 target is by focusing on strong policy action in only some sectors, while neglecting others. This approach may make it nearly impossible to meet its 2045 climate neutrality target for all sectors. The government weakened the climate change law in May 2024, replacing the compliance mechanism around binding sectoral targets with the ability for sectors to compensate for each other, as long as the overall target is met.\n",
    "The climate change law's amendment conceals the fact that the transport and buildings sectors will exceed their sectoral 2030 targets. It will be almost impossible for the transport sector to catch up on emissions reductions after 2030 without drastic and disruptive measures, such as extremely high CO2 prices or driving bans. Compensation by the other sectors is also not possible after 2030, as it will become increasingly difficult for sectors to avoid the last few tonnes of CO2.\n",
    "It is also of concern that Germany is set to miss the legally binding target within the EU effort-sharing scheme, in which transport and buildings are counted together. This brings the threat of high payments, as any failure to meet the target must be offset by certificates. Overall, without further action, Germany will exceed the target by at least 126 MtCO2e between 2021 and 2030.This overshoot will be expensive; for example, if certificates are each priced at EUR 100, the gap in emissions will cost German taxpayers EUR 12bn.\n",
    "Given a broad and just transformation to a 1.5°C compatible society is required, it is inadequate that Germany, one of the world's richest countries, waters down its climate law and fails to implement even simple measures, such as a general speed limit on freeways, as we see record high temperatures and devastating climate impacts around the world and in Germany.\n",
    "Recent positive policy developments include:\n",
    "- **Emissions outlook improved due to policies of the current government:** since the government came into place in 2021, our projected emissions for 2030 have significantly decreased. In 2021, we estimated a reduction under current policies of 55% in 2030 below 1990, while today we estimate a reduction of 62-64%.",
    "- **Renewables and market-driven coal exit:** the German government has systematically removed barriers to the expansion of renewables, such as by making the renewable expansion a higher public good. For solar, it is well ahead of its own expansion targets, but behind for wind. At the same time, Germany phased out the last of its nuclear reactors in spring 2022 and shut down 4.5 GW of coal-fired power generation in spring 2024, while maintaining the price of electricity and the stability of the power system. It is set to phase out coal entirely by 2038 at the latest, with the legal possibility of bringing this forward. If the EU ETS prices remain high, they will likely drive coal out of the market in Germany by 2030 due to its unprofitability.",
    "- **Use of levy on heavy-duty trucks to invest in rail infrastructure:** Germany increased the levy on heavy-duty trucks on freeways and plans to invest most of the revenues in rail infrastructure. This is a good example of charging polluting activities and supporting less polluting activities.",
    "In many areas, Germany still needs to make significant policy improvements to meet its climate and energy targets, and go beyond them, towards a Paris-compatible trajectory:\n",
    "- **Strengthening the climate law instead of weakening it:** the new climate law adopted May 2024 makes the whole government responsible for meeting the targets, rather than individual ministries. However, responsibility of individual ministries for achieving the sectoral targets was explicitly introduced in the old law to make them accountable for climate policy in their respective sector. This dilution of responsibility reduces the likelihood of Germany meeting its targets. The ministries of buildings and transport failed to submit the emergency programme required by the old climate law and have consequently been brought to court by NGOs. The Climate Protection Act needs to be strengthened in order to ensure that the target of climate neutrality by 2045 is achieved.",
    "- **Develop and implement a transport sector strategy:** the Transport Ministry appears to have no intention of implementing policies to initiate the sector’s transition towards zero emissions: it ignored the advice of the government’s own environmental agency, which proposed a whole suite of measures that could be used to reduce emissions in the transport sector. Instead, the ministry delayed the EU-wide emission standards for cars by lobbying for e-fuels, raised individual commuter support and expedited the planning of 144 freeway projects. It also abruptly cut the subsidy for EVs, which may not have had immediate effects, but means the government will miss its target of 15 million EVs on the road by 2030 by a wide margin. The ministry has also been the driving force behind weakening the climate law by ditching the law’s requirement for submitting emergency programmes. Before it changed the requirement, the ministry failed to submit emergency programmes for the three years in which the sector overshot its emissions target.",
    "- **Comply with own 65% renewables target in building sector**: the government had agreed in its coalition contract and thereafter on the ambitious goal that, as of 2024, all new heating systems would use 65% renewable energy. However, an intensive debate emerged, particularly around a ban on new fossil fuel heating systems. A relatively ambitious draft law was significantly watered down and subsequently adopted. Under this law, neither the CO2 price nor the sectoral target are strong enough to achieve the originally envisaged 65% goal. The populist debates created uncertainty in the heating industry and kept many households with fossil fuel heating.",
    "- **Send a clear signal against fossil gas in Germany and abroad**: in light of the energy crisis, the government continues to promote new infrastructure for fossil fuels in and outside Germany, thereby continuing to create new fossil fuel dependencies. The government has supported the build out of oversized LNG import capacities, gas powered „hydrogen-ready“ power plants and recently decided to still allow for public financing into fossil gas abroad.",
    "- **Focus on a socially just transition**: climate policies in general, climate policies are losing support across the German population because public discourse is focused on the costs and burdens of climate action on private households. The government should therefore focus on the social impacts of climate policies. For example, it could bring back the previously agreed upon “climate dividend,” where every citizen would receive a lump sum payment from the revenue generated through the carbon pricing mechanism. The government has postponed this measure to the next legislative period.",
    "\n## Description of CAT ratings\n",
    "The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.\n",
    "Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.\n",
    "The CAT rates Germany’s overall climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates Germany’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "We rate Germany’s 2030 emissions reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways, consistent with 2°C of warming, and “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to other countries to meet its fair-share contribution.\n",
    "To achieve its target, Germany needs to enhance its policies and actions. It claims that it will achieve its 2030 target with current legislation, but our assessment, supported by other independent analysis, finds that it will miss it.\n",
    "We rate Germany’s policies and actions until 2030 “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. We project that implemented policies and actions will lead to emissions reductions of between 62-64% below 1990 levels by 2030 excl. LULUCF. This is significantly lower than previous projections but still falls short of Germany’s 2030 target of at least 65% reduction below 1990 levels.\n",
    "The German government, in power since December 2021, is significantly accelerating domestic climate policy implementation, but remains deeply divided on the general approach, reflecting the unconsolidated positions of the different coalition parties. While the Green Party is pushing for fast action, e.g. in buildings and the expansion of renewables, the Social Democrats and in particular, the Liberal Party are delaying implementation. All parties support expansion of LNG terminals, which is counterproductive to climate policy.\n",
    "In the 2021 coalition contract, the government decided not to raise the ambition of the mitigation target, but promised that the measures adopted in the agreement would overachieve the target (ARD, 2021). But with currently implemented measures, Germany’s 2030 target is in danger, its overachievement is very unlikely, and it is certainly not close to putting emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway by 2030.\n",
    "Outlook on greenhouse gas emissions improved significantly since the new government has been in power, but its own 2030 target is unlikely to be met with the current policies. Also, the legally binding target within the EU effort-sharing scheme, in which transport and buildings are counted together, will not be met. In addition, the government weakened the climate law.\n",
    "50% of electricity in 2023 was generated from renewable sources. The share of coal in the electricity system has been halved over the last five years, but still stands at 23% for January to mid-April 2024. Solar expansion is well ahead of the target, while wind is behind.\n",
    "The coalition also wanted to introduce a climate check for each new piece of legislation, but implementation has been slow. In spring 2023, the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) tendered a project to consider possible approaches, the research was not completed as of June 2024 and a climate check was not yet introduced.\n",
    "To cope with Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine and related energy security issues, Germany has introduced a set of measures, some of which are counterproductive to climate policy. The government still plans to develop an overcapacity of LNG import infrastructure, which risks further locking in fossil fuels and brings into question Germany’s long-term ambitions for GHG neutrality.\n",
    "The coalition committed to making the climate transition socially just, but has so far failed to do so in various areas. A climate dividend (“Klimageld”), to pay back revenues from carbon pricing on a per capita basis, was seeded in the coalition contract but will most likely not be implemented in this legislative period.\n",
    "A temporary rebate on VAT for fuels and a compensation mechanism for high gas prices were given without social differentiation. One positive outcome is that the new heating law contains plans to differentiate the subsidies for CO2-free heating systems by household income.\n",
    "The full policies and action analysis can be found here.\n",
    "We rate Germany’s 2030 reduction target of 65% below 1990 levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s proposed reduction target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements, if changed to 69%.\n",
    "If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. While this target represents a significant improvement compared to its previous target, Germany’s new target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvement.\n",
    "The CAT’s assessment of Germany’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.\n",
    "We rate Germany’s 2030 target of 65% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s target in 2030 and its climate finance contribution needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to its fair share.\n",
    "Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to others to meet its fair-share contribution. Germany’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "Germany’s international public climate finance contributions are better than most developed countries but still rated \"Insufficient.\" Germany has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share as assessed by the CAT.\n",
    "To improve its rating, Germany needs to increase its international climate finance contributions in the order of factor of three, and, most urgently, stop funding fossil fuels abroad. At COP26, Germany signed a declaration to stop financing fossil fuels abroad, but later pushed to roll back this decision. The CAT rates Germany’s international climate finance “Insufficient”.\n",
    "Germany’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates Germany’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.\n",
    "In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law. The net zero target generally covers key elements but fails to meet good practice standards for some of them.\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: “Average.” The German government needs to legislate its commitments to include international aviation and shipping emissions and undertake planning on how to reach the 2045 target to improve its rating to “Acceptable”.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.\n",
    "In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law and submitted its updated LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2022. The net zero target generally covers all key elements but fails to meet good practice as defined by the Climate Action Tracker for some of them. Germany also falls under the European Union net zero target (see separate CAT analysis).\n",
    "Germany’s target covers all sectors and gases underpinned by an emissions pathway until 2040 and the communication of binding sectoral targets until 2030. International aviation and shipping remain outside of the target’s scope. A periodic and legally-binding review process of measures and interim targets per an Expert Council is in place. Germany provides separate reduction and removal targets with regards to LULUCF but remains unclear on any other carbon removal. The net zero target is enshrined in law by way of Germany’s Climate Protection Act.\n",
    "The German government is failing to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on some key elements with an update of the ‘Climate Action Plan 2050’ still under development as of June 2024. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Germany’s own territory, but it remains unclear whether Germany reserves right to use of international offset credits. Lastly, Germany has missed communicating transparent assumptions on carbon storage and removal.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "- **Target year** – Germany aims to reach net zero by 2045, and states that emissions shall move to net negative after 2050 (German Governmenst, 2021c, 2022).",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – Germany’s target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – Germany’s net zero target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The German government only notes that it will keep emissions from international bunkers that are attributable to Germany in mind when assessing the achievement of its climate targets and will take “appropriate steps to reduce them within the limits of what is feasible at the national level” (Federal Ministry for Environment Nature Conservation, 2016; German Government, 2021b) .",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Germany provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in its climate strategy submitted to the UNFCCC (German Government, 2022). While the climate law explicitly reserves the right to use such credits (in §3), Germany has not yet communicated its intention to rely on them (German Government, 2021b).",
    "- **Legal status** – The amended climate law, together with the updated target for 2045, was adopted in June 2021. Germany had announced its first net zero target in 2016 as part of its ‘Climate Action Plan 2050’ (Federal Ministry for Environment Nature Conservation, 2016). The strategy was adopted by the government as a national climate policy but is not enshrined into law. Germany officially submitted the ‘Climate Action Plan 2050’ to the UNFCCC in 2017 as the country’s first long-term strategy (LTS) under the Paris Agreement. In November 2022, Germany submitted an update to its LTS to the UNFCCC with a full update of the ‘Climate Action Plan’, and the so-called ‘Immediate Climate Action Programme’ is still pending (German Government, 2022).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The climate law and LTS specify a separate emission removal target for forestry. Therein, Germany sets an emissions target of -25 MtCO2e by 2030, -35 MtCO2e by 2040 and -40 MtCO2e by 2045 for the LULUCF sector. The climate law does not specify if and how other carbon removals, such as direct air capture or biomass energy carbon capture and storage could be used to reach the net zero goal.",
    "- **Review process** – Germany has a legally binding process in place to review its emissions pathways, intermediate targets, milestones and associated measures in its national climate policy (Federal Ministry for Environment Nature Conservation, 2016; German Government, 2021b). Germany annually prepares a climate action report to monitor progress and examine the implementation of national climate policies (German Ministry of the Environment, 2020). Additionally, the updated climate law strengthened the position of the Expert Council to give its judgment on developments and trends of Germany’s emissions every two years (German Government, 2021b). The updated LTS further aims to strengthen scientific advice by establishing a ‘climate change mitigation scientific platform’ to back up the LTS and strategic support for climate policy planning (German Government, 2022).",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The climate law specifies the scale of forestry removals, namely 40 MtCO2e by 2045, and refers to the EU legislation on how they should be accounted for. But it does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals from other technologies, such as direct air capture or biomass energy carbon capture and storage, envisaged to achieve the net zero target. The national climate policy only makes general notes on carbon dioxide removals as a potential component of a long-term strategy without providing any specific detail.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – In June 2021, Germany moved the net-zero year from 2050 to 2045 without presenting an underlying emissions reduction scenario nor any concrete measures. However, it can be positively noted that the updated climate law and updated LTS provide annual reduction targets from 2030 to 2040 and binding annual emission limits at the sectoral level until 2030. The law and strategy further state that no later than 2032, the government shall submit a legislative proposal to establish annual reduction targets for the years 2041 to 2045.",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Germany recognises its responsibility for an appropriate contribution towards reaching the international climate target and acknowledges the differentiated obligation for higher-income states in doing so. Germany fails to clearly define its fairness considerations beyond a general acknowledgement of dissimilar ambitions based on economic strength. Germany does not address the gap between its net zero target considered realistic domestically and what would be a fair contribution to the global goal.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "Germany’s current policies are “almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. With implemented policies, Germany’s 2030 target is in danger and it will not achieve its long-term targets.\n",
    "The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C .\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Since it came into power in December 2021, the German government has been significantly accelerating domestic climate policy implementation, but remains deeply divided on the general approach, reflecting the divergent positions of the different coalition parties. We observe that the Green Party is pushing for fast action, e.g. in buildings and for renewables, the Social Democrats and, in particular, the Liberal Party are delaying implementation. All parties support expansion of LNG terminals, which is counterproductive to climate policy.\n",
    "The restructuring of the ministries at the beginning of the current legislature looked as though emphasis was given to climate action: there is now one Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, which lifts climate policy up the agenda. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now responsible for climate change negotiations, giving it prominence. The Ministries of Transport and Finance in turn have ministers from the Liberal Party, which has a far more lenient approach to climate policy than the Green Party.\n",
    "We conclude from our review of the inventory (UBA, 2024b) and government emissions projections from March 2024 (UBA, 2024c), that the 2030 target is still in danger, even if the official projections claim that it will be met in aggregate. The official projections are very optimistic as they assume that the 80% renewable electricity target is met, CO2 prices remain high and activity of emission-intensive industry remains low. Recent capacity additions for wind are not at all in line with that goal and CO2 prices are currently lower than assumed. The government therefore needs to remain active to ensure that its own target is safely met.\n",
    "We also find that the way the government plans to meet the 2030 target (UBA, 2024c) may make it almost impossible to meet the 2045 climate neutrality target for all sectors. The government weakened the climate change law in May 2024, replacing the compliance mechanism around binding sectoral targets with the ability for sectors to compensate for each other, as long as the overall target is met.  Amending the compliance mechanism conceals the fact that the transport and buildings sectors will exceed their 2030 targets. It will be almost impossible for the transport sector to catch up after 2030 unless drastic and disruptive measures are taken, such as extremely high CO2 prices or driving bans. Compensation by the other sectors is also not possible after 2030, as it will become increasingly difficult for sectors to avoid the last few tonnes of CO2.\n",
    "It is also worrying that Germany will miss the legally binding target within the EU effort-sharing scheme, in which transport and buildings are counted together. There is a threat of high payments, as any failure to meet the target must be offset by certificates. Overall, Germany will exceed its target by at least 126 MtCO2e, costing German taxpayers, at a roughly estimated price of EUR 100 per certificate, EUR 12bn.\n",
    "The new May 2024 climate law makes the whole government responsible for meeting the targets, rather than individual ministries. However, the previous law had explicitly placed individual ministries as responsible for achieving their sectoral targets, to make them accountable for climate policy in their respective sector. The May 2024 dilution of responsibility reduces the likelihood of Germany meeting its targets. The ministries of buildings and transport failed to submit the emergency programme required by the old climate law and have consequently been brought to court by NGOs.\n",
    "In the coalition contract, the new government decided not to raise the ambition of the mitigation target, but promised the measures adopted in the coalition agreement would overachieve the target (ARD, 2021). Not only does the government still need to meet its 2030 target, it needs to enhance it, as it’s still not 1.5˚C compatible. Germany, along with all governments, have agreed to increase their 2030 action as part of UNFCCC decisions since 2021.\n",
    "The coalition also wanted to introduce a climate check for each new law, but implementation has been slow. In early 2023, the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) tendered a project to consider possible approaches, the research was not completed as of June 2024 and a climate check has not yet been introduced.\n",
    "To cope with Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine and related energy security issues, Germany introduced a set of measures, some of which are counterproductive to climate policy. The government still plans to develop an overcapacity of LNG import infrastructure (Höhne et al., 2023; Marquardt et al., 2023), which risks a lock-in of fossil fuels and brings into question Germany’s long-term ambitions for GHG neutrality.\n",
    "The coalition embarked on making the climate transition socially just, but has so far failed to do so in several areas: a climate dividend (“Klimageld”), to pay back revenues from carbon pricing on a per capita basis, was seeded in the coalition contract but will now probably only be implemented after 2025, under the next government (Deutschlandfunk, 2024). A temporary rebate on VAT for fuels and a compensation mechanism for high gas prices during times of very high energy prices were given without social differentiation. A positive step is that the new heating law differentiates the subsidies for CO2-free heating systems by household income.\n",
    "\n## Power\n",
    "According to the targets anchored in the climate law, the energy sector (electricity and heat supply) will have to limit its GHG emissions to 108 MtCO2e by 2030, a reduction of 62% below 1990 levels. In 2023, total emissions from the energy supply sector stood at 205 MtCO2e, a decrease of 51 MtCO2e compared to the previous year. Renewable energy covers half of gross electricity consumption for the first time, and coal-fired power generation declined as electricity demand decreased (Expertenrat für Klimafragen, 2024).\n",
    "Despite these positive developments, the sluggish expansion of wind energy and the extensive new investments in gas infrastructure pose a risk to Germany's ability to achieve its longer-term targets for 2030 and 2045. A slow and gradual coal phase-out by 2038 puts pressure on global emissions budgets, which require a coal phase-out by 2030 (CAT, 2023).\n",
    "The government intends to phase out coal by 2030, with phase outs already negotiated for the western coal mines and is attempting to do the same in Eastern Germany.\n",
    "With the policies currently adopted, Germany could exceed its 2030 power sector target. However, the official projections from the UBA report assumes that the renewable electric capacity increases as in the government's original plans from early 2022. For solar energy, this has been the case. For wind energy, implementation has once again fallen behind in 2023.\n",
    "The price for CO2 emission allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), has recently fallen steadily from a level of EUR 100/tCO2 in February 2023 to a low of EUR 52/tCO2 in April 2024, and is currently between EUR 60-75/tCO2[1]. With the reform of the EU ETS, it was expected that these prices would increase further. Higher prices make coal very unattractive compared to renewables.\n",
    "[1] Carbon Price Tracker | Ember (ember-climate.org)\n",
    "Accelerating renewable energy expansion is a priority of the German government and has been approached in a very comprehensive manner through increased targets and planned legislative measures that aim at overcoming very specific challenges for renewables in Germany.\n",
    "The Renewable Energy Law (EEG) and the wind energy offshore law (WindSeeG) were revised in 2023, determining that renewable energy installations are of public interest so they can be prioritised over other issues, and give particular support for rooftop solar PV, increase the focus on participatory models for citizens, support storage, and redirect biogas towards flexible power generation (BMWK, 2023f, 2023d).\n",
    "Electricity generation from renewables stands at 60% January to July 2024 (Fraunhofer ISE, 2024c).\n",
    "The German government aims to raise the share of electricity generated from renewable energy to 80% of gross electricity consumption by 2030 (BMWK, 2022) while increasing overall electricity use to further electrify the transport, buildings and industry sectors. This goal is not yet fully aligned with the Paris Agreement but is getting close: studies suggest the share of renewable electricity in total generation needs to reach 85-100% by 2030 to be compatible with a 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).\n",
    "The government is aiming for capacity additions for solar PV and onshore and offshore wind to a total of 360 GW cumulative installed capacity by 2030 (30GW offshore wind, 115 GW onshore wind, 215 GW solar PV)(Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection, 2022), more than twice the current capacity of 161 GW (Fraunhofer ISE, 2024a).\n",
    "Solar capacity additions are ramping up at record levels, with the addition of 15 GW in 2023 alone, showing the effect of government policies. If the trend of the first six months continues, Germany will build an additional 15.2 GW of new solar capacity in 2024 (Fraunhofer ISE, 2024b). The government’s plan is to annually expand solar capacity by 22 GW each year by 2028 (Wirth, 2023), the realisation of which appears to be within reach if the pace of massive expansion continues. The installed capacity of solar energy increased by around 130% between 2012 and 2022 (IEA, 2024).\n",
    "According to the government's targets on wind energy, an expansion of 14 GW would be required for 2023 and 2024. This would meet the 2024 EEG onshore wind target of 69GW and, assuming linear interpolation, the offshore wind target of 30GW installed capacity by 2030. In 2023 and 2024 so far, wind energy has only been expanded by 4.5 GW (Fraunhofer ISE, 2024b).\n",
    "Onshore wind capacity expansion remains below its all-time high of 5.5 GW in 2017. In 2023, only an additional 3 GW were newly built (Deutsche WindGuard GmbH, 2024), half of the planned 6 GW (BMWK, 2022). This needs to be ramped up to 16 GW annually by 2029 to meet the government's target, five times faster than in 2023.\n",
    "The government's own projections report assumes the expansion targets for wind are met, which we judge as optimistic. For our analysis, we use a range for wind expansion between fully meeting the target and only adding half the capacity each year.\n",
    "As part of its National Hydrogen Strategy (German Government, 2020b), the government is providing EUR 11bn to support projects (BMWK, 2023a). The first auction of “Carbon Contracts for Difference” (CCfDs), through which the additional costs of companies compared to conventional production are compensated, was launched mid-March 2024 (BMWK, 2024b). The strategy was updated in June 2023, doubling the previous goal for electrolyser capacity from 5 GW to 10 GW in 2030 (BMWK, 2023c). The strategy also includes support for several projects to import green hydrogen to Germany from Australia, Morocco, Brazil and South Africa, and the development of an auction model for green hydrogen. Importing green hydrogen from distant countries such as Australia and South Africa calls into question its sustainability due to the significant emissions generated during transport. The hydrogen strategy explicitly includes hydrogen from fossil gas for an interim period.\n",
    "The share of coal in the electricity system has been halved over the last five years, but still stands at 21% for January to July 2024, of which three-quarters are from lignite, the most emissions-intense form of coal (Fraunhofer ISE, 2024d). Roughly one third of CO2 emissions from coal-fired electricity generation in Europe are from Germany (IEA, 2021).\n",
    "In July 2020, the previous government adopted a coal exit law stipulating the last coal-fired power plant will be closed by 2038. The compromise was found only by compensating the affected regions (with EUR 40bn) and the affected companies operating the coal-fired power plants (with an additional EUR 4.35bn) (Agora Energiewende, 2019; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, 2019).\n",
    "In November 2020, the European Commission approved its proposed competitive coal phase-out tender mechanism under the coal exit law (European Commission, 2021). In the first auction rounds between September 2020 and March 2022, the Federal Network Agency awarded bids for a combined capacity of around 9.7 GW (Bundesnetzagentur, 2022).\n",
    "The operators received up to EUR 165,000 for each MW of installed capacity to be phased out by the end of 2022 at the latest and, in 2021, a total of 5.8 GW coal capacity was retired (Bundesnetzagentur, 2021, 2022; Global Energy Monitor et al., 2022).\n",
    "A total of 15 lignite and hard coal-fired power plants in Germany were shut down by April 2024. This included seven lignite-fired power plant units with a capacity of around 3.1 gigawatts, which the German government had originally planned to shut down earlier. Due to energy-saving measures for natural gas during the energy crisis, the shutdown date for two of these units was postponed and the remaining five units were taken out of security standby (MDR, 2024; Zeit, 2024).\n",
    "According to the coalition agreement, the government wants to phase out coal by 2030. However, there is no consensus on this among the federal states, and a legally required evaluation of the feasibility of the coal phase-out by 2030 by the federal government has not yet taken place. While the energy company RWE and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia agreed on a coal phase-out by 2030, the eastern German states recently emphasised their rejection of a phase-out of coal mining in the region by 2030 (Tagesschau, 2024b).\n",
    "First attempts to move the coal phase-out to an earlier date have likely led to more greenhouse gas emissions according to our analysis: in early 2022, the largest coal operator in west Germany, RWE, and the state government of that region struck a deal under which the coal phase-out would be moved forward from 2038 to 2030 at the expense of moving the shut-down of some capacity originally scheduled for a 2022 closure back to 2024, in an attempt to save gas.\n",
    "For RWE, this is probably a good deal because it will lead to more operating hours before 2030 than originally planned. After 2030 it would likely not have been viable to operate the coal-fired power plants anyway, because of the high carbon price expected from the revised EU ETS. This deal saved several villages from destruction. However, it did not save the iconic village of Lützerath as it was argued the lignite underneath the village was needed for energy security in Germany (RWE Power AG, 2023). This was contested by scientific groups (Oei et al., 2023), heavily criticised by civil society, and led to major protests.\n",
    "Fossil gas is currently providing 13% of Germany's electricity. Only 13% of gas is used in the electricity sector: most is used in industry and for heating (BDEW, 2024).\n",
    "If renewables are expanded as planned and coal is phased out, the existing gas-fired power plants could provide the remaining electricity, if they run on a higher load. This is, however, unlikely, as with the large share of variable renewables, the flexibility of other sources in the system will need to increase and will need to cover peaks in demand, rather than running long hours. Building new gas peaker plants is expensive. While power plants that operate as combined heat and power (CHP) generation are more efficient, they are much less flexible, with only a limited ability to react to variations in the grid. The German government should carefully consider which combination of storage capacity, grid investments, demand management, and additional gas peaker plants is most (cost) efficient when moving to a high share of renewable energy. The stakeholder consultation process “Platform for a climate neutral electricity system” (BMWK, 2023e) is working to fill the current gap of an overall plan.\n",
    "In its new strategy in February 2024, the government agreed to support four new gas-powered stations that would initially run on fossil gas, but would need to move to hydrogen between 2035 and 2040 (BMWK, 2024a). With this strategy, the government takes a transitional approach without a fully comprehensive plan.\n",
    "As a reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the need to reduce dependency energy imports from Russia, the German government is pursuing partnerships with other potential suppliers. These include Qatar, the US and Senegal (Tagesschau, 2022). Such long-term partnerships not only risk a lock-in of the German economy into the unsustainable use of a fossil fuel, but also threatens the necessary transition in the partner countries and raises questions around international justice and geopolitical risks.\n",
    "In April 2023, the last nuclear power plant was disconnected from the German grid. Due to the gas crisis, the end date was postponed from 31 December 2022 to 15 April 2023. The shutdown provides investment certainty for renewables and paves the way to a truly sustainable electricity system.\n",
    "In 2024, one year after the last nuclear power plants were shut down, the feared impact on electricity prices proved unfounded. The remaining share of nuclear energy amounted to 3.6 % of electricity consumption in 2023 and came from imports from neighbouring countries such as France. Meanwhile, renewable energy like solar and wind, are progressively fulfilling the demand. (Agora Energiewende, 2024).\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "The industry sector in Germany emitted 155 MtCO2e in 2023 and accounted for approximately one fifth of Germany’s total emissions (UBA, 2024d). Around 80% of the sector’s total emissions in 2023 came from steel, petrochemical, cement, and chemical production (Kędzierski, 2024). The sector's emissions declined rapidly in the 1990s. Since the 2000s, this decline slowed, with fluctuations mostly driven by economic factors rather than by climate policy.\n",
    "Since 2022 and continuing through 2023, many industries have decreased production because of high energy prices, especially for fossil gas. As a result, emissions have fallen by approximately 15% since 2021 and have overachieved the sector’s emission reductions target for 2023 by 17 MtCO2e.\n",
    "Based on the UBA’s forecast, the sector is projected to continue emitting at a level below its annual emission targets until 2027. The UBA acknowledges that the current high energy prices have contributed to lower sectoral emissions and that the price level is likely temporary. The UBA projects that, starting in 2027, the industry sector will overshoot its yearly targets and, ultimately, exceed the climate change law’s 2030 sectoral target by 4 MtCO2e.\n",
    "The potential impact of improved energy efficiency measures and other structural changes that would reduce emissions in the long term is minimal (Expertenrat für Klimafragen, 2023). To achieve the 2030 target and get on a pathway towards climate neutrality, the industrial sector needs to reduce fossil energy consumption much faster and electrify processes at much greater speed (ibid).\n",
    "As a reaction to the dual COVID and energy crises, governments of large economies, such as the US and China, have implemented programmes to improve the competitiveness of their domestic industries on the global market. Germany, where export industries are central to the economy, seems under pressure to follow suit, and has previously - and continues to - support its energy intensive industry though a range of exemptions and subsidies. State support for the sector includes exempting industry from the renewable energy levy, reducing the electricity tax rate, reserving free allocations in the EU ETS, and introducing “Carbon Contracts for Difference” (CCfDs) in 2024.\n",
    "The EU ETS, which covers large industrial installations, showed new record CO2 prices in 2023, breaching EUR 100t/CO2 in February, 2023 (Twidale et al., 2023). However, prices have since collapsed: in February 2024, the price had fallen to approximately EUR 52/tCO2 (Tamellini, 2024). In April, 2024, the ETS price hovered around EUR 70t/CO2; a price level significantly lower than the official projections assume. Even with the previously high allowance prices, the effect of the additional costs for emissions-intensive processes was minor, as a substantial number of allowances for industry were still available for free. The number of free allowances is set to decrease over the next decade. The 2038 target for achieving net-zero under the EU ETS provides a strong signal for industry to decarbonise more rapidly.\n",
    "In the short term, there is a risk that industrial players will not invest in low-carbon solutions, as these technologies are still new and relatively expensive, even if they already pay off in the long-term. To incentivise investments in low-carbon technologies, the government initiated the first round of bidding for CCfDs in March, 2024 (Moulson, 2024). CCfDs guarantee a certain fixed price for low-carbon industrial products and processes that are not yet price competitive. The programme aims at augmenting the uptake of low-carbon technologies in particularly energy-intensive industries, such as the chemical, steel, cement, paper and glass production industries (Kędzierski, 2024).\n",
    "The CCfDs’ first round of bidding makes EUR 4bn available for innovative industrial projects that achieve a 60% emission reduction in three years and a 90% reduction in 15 years, relative to when employing conventional technologies. A second bidding round, worth EUR 19bn, is planned for the end of 2024 (BMWK, 2023b). In theory, this policy lowers the risk, therefore enabling industry to make significant investments in emerging low emission technologies that may substantially reduce the sector’s emissions. However, it remains unclear for how long the federal budget will be able to support such a high-cost intervention. The recent fluctuations in the EU ETS prices further complicate the potential for CCfDs to function as intended (Kędzierski, 2024).\n",
    "Electrification is key to decarbonising the industry sector: a central challenge is the relatively high electricity price in Germany. To alleviate the financial burden of the high price, in November 2023, the government reduced the electricity tax for the industry sector, lowering it from 1.537ct/kWh to the EU’s minimum rate of 0.05ct/kWh (Bundesregierung, 2023). The government has guaranteed this reduced rate through 2025 and, depending on the federal budget, may extend the reduction through 2028.\n",
    "Beyond moderating tax rates in the short term, the Ministry of Economy and Climate Change, in a 2023 working paper on electricity prices for energy-intensive installations, suggests using CCfDs and publicly-guaranteed power purchase agreements for industries with renewable energy producers to facilitate industry access to “cheap green electricity” in the long term (BMWK, 2023g).\n",
    "The government's challenge is to ensure a stable economy in the short term, while transitioning to a zero-carbon industrial sector - in a just manner - in the long term. A robust regulatory framework that supports a long-term vision of transitioning and decarbonising the sector may alleviate bureaucratic challenges, and targeted efforts to address the shortage of skilled workers should be considered to complement subsidies.\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "In 2023, the transport sector was responsible for approximately 20% of Germany’s total emissions. According to the government’s targets, transport sector emissions need to be reduced by 44% below 1990 levels. This means that emissions need to fall to 85 MtCO2e in 2030. Emissions were still at 146MtCO2e in 2023 and 12 MtCO2e above national target pathway for 2023. Transport emissions in 2030 are expected to overshoot the target by 26 MtCO2e (UBA, 2024d).\n",
    "The Ministry of Transport has the ignored the government’s own environmental agency and its policy recommendations for reducing emissions in the transport sector (UBA, 2023c). Instead, the ministry weakened the climate law by removing the emergency programme protocol; previously, emergency policy packages needed to be submitted when a given sector overshot its emissions target. Over the past several years, the Ministry of Transport has generally obstructed more climate action than it has supported:\n",
    "- It suddenly and prematurely eliminated purchase incentives for light and heavy-duty electric vehicles at the end of 2023 following federal budget cuts (BAFA, 2023).",
    "- Germany delayed the adoption of the revised CO2-standards for cars at the EU level and negotiated for the continued use ICE vehicles powered by CO2-neutral e-fuels after 2035 (Packroff, 2023). Germany is lobbying for a similar exception under the new CO2-standards for heavy-duty vehicles, which have yet to be adopted (Wacket and Abnett, 2024).",
    "- The ministry negotiated favourable treatment of 144 freeway projects that will be accelerated.",
    "- The individual commuter support was increased during the energy crisis, which incentivises longer travel distance between home and workplace and therefore more transport activity.",
    "- The carbon price increase in the German ETS was temporarily suspended due to the energy crisis in 2022.",
    "- The transport ministry objects to a speed limit for freeways. According to Federal Environment Agency research, a speed limit on highways of 130, 120 or 100 km/h would result in emissions savings of 1.5, 2 and 4.3 MtCO2e/year, respectively, which is equal to 5-14% of emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles on highways. It is important to note that Germany is one of the only countries in the world without freeway speed limits. (UBA, 2023d).",
    "Recent policies that support emissions reductions include:\n",
    "- Restructuring of the freeway fee for trucks according to CO2 emissions of the vehicles. The revenue will be used to expand railway infrastructure.",
    "- Introducing the “Germany ticket,” which costs EUR 49 per month and is valid on all forms of public transport and regional trains. Overall, the direct impact of the ticket on emissions in 2030 is limited.",
    "Support for public transport has somewhat increased, but the government is far from reaching its targets. The government plans to double the volume of rail passenger transport by 2030 compared to today’s level, increase the capacity and attractiveness of public transport, and raise the share of journeys undertaken by bicycle or on foot.\n",
    "However, the government remains vague regarding specific instruments and necessary finance for achieving these goals (BMWK, 2022). In 2021, rail accounted for only 8% of total passenger transport, while cycling and walking make up only 6% (BMWK, 2022).\n",
    "Deutsche Bahn, the national rail company, and the government further plan to invest EUR 86bn into the rail network by 2030. The income generated from the increase in the freeway fee for trucks will be used to cover half of these investments. The source for the remaining half is to be determined.\n",
    "Germany introduced the “Germany ticket” in May 2023. The ticket, costing EUR 49 month, grants access to all means of local public transit, including regional trains, countrywide. By May 2024, approximately 11 million tickets had been issued. Estimates for the ticket’s short-term impact on emissions range from reductions of 4.2MtCO2e/y to 22.6MtCO2e/y by 2030 (Expertenrat für Klimafragen, 2024). The long-term impact may be more significant, given the single ticket system makes using public transport more accessible.\n",
    "Government policies do not appear to be sufficient to achieve the 2030 target of 15 million electric vehicles (Koska and Jansen, 2022). The most recent UBA emissions projection report notes that, given sectoral developments, the target of 15 million electric vehicles will not be achieved. The report assumes only 8 million electric vehicles will be registered in 2030. On 1 January 2024, only 1.4 million battery electric cars were registered in Germany. The share of newly-registered battery- and fuel cell-electric cars in 2023 was nearly 20% (EAFO, 2024).\n",
    "Although the share of electric cars is increasing, both the existing vehicle fleet and new vehicle registrations remain dominated by internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Research also suggests that the 15 million electric vehicle target is itself not sufficient to meet the sectoral emissions target for passenger transport set in the climate law (Koska and Jansen, 2022). To achieve the emissions target, at least 20 million electric vehicles need to be registered in 2030. Additional measures are needed to accelerate electric vehicle uptake, including the introduction of a registration tax for CO2-intensive cars, a higher CO2-price, or a comprehensive reform of company car taxation.\n",
    "The government eliminated the purchase subsidy for electric cars at the end of 2023. Previously, the financial incentive for newly-purchased BEVs retailing at EUR 45,000 or less was worth up to EUR 6,750 (EUR 4,500 from the government and EUR 2,250 from manufacturers) (ADAC, 2023a). Although the eliminated subsidies have largely been absorbed by auto manufacturers and the German electric vehicle market is relatively mature, registrations of new electric vehicles have slowed since the government incentive’s termination: battery electric vehicles registrations were 14 percent lower in the first quarter of 2024 than in the same period in 2023 (KBA, 2024e); a worrisome outlook given that the German government anticipated new electric vehicle registrations to increase by nearly 40% in 2024 relative to 2023 (UBA, 2024a).\n",
    "Charging infrastructure is expanding, with over 115,000 public charging points in place in November, 2023 (Bundesnetzagentur, 2024); an increase of over 80% since the end of 2021 (BMDV, 2024). The government plans to operationalise one million public charging points for electric vehicles by 2030 (BMDV, 2022).\n",
    "The EU strengthened the CO2 emissions performance standards in April 2023: by 2035, all new passenger cars must be zero emissions. The German government delayed the adoption of the new CO2-standards by negotiating for an exception for e-fuels. This is problematic for several reasons: there are no cars that run exclusively on e-fuels, e-fuels will remain significantly more expensive in comparison to directly using electricity from batteries, and e-fuels are not zero emissions. Vehicles fuelled by e-fuels, as defined by EU’s Renewable Energy Directive methodology, are expected to use six times the electricity and emit 61 gCO2e/km in 2035 (Transport & Environment, 2023). The focus on e-fuels therefore only prolongs the production of diesel and petrol cars and hinders the transition towards non-ICE-based vehicles. As the EU worked towards strengthening the CO2 emission performance standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2024, Germany again delayed the legislative process by lobbying for an exemption for e-fuels.\n",
    "The German government's carbon price on transport fuels remains far too low to meet the target without other supportive measures. The fixed price was set at EUR 25/tCO2 in 2021 and increased to EUR 30/tCO2 in 2022. Price increases were suspended due to the energy crisis, but as of 2024 the price was raised to EUR 45/tCO2e. From 2026, new allowances will be auctioned in a range of EUR 55 to EUR 65/tCO2e (German Government, 2020a). In 2027, the German ETS will be merged into the revised EU ETS for transport and buildings.\n",
    "The impact of the German ETS on GHG emissions in the transport sector is limited, as the carbon price of EUR 45/tCO2e translates into a relatively small markup on the petrol price. By 2026, the price will increase to a maximum of EUR 65/tCO2e (ICAP, 2022). Whether the price will change the investment behaviour of car owners depends on the price level and its predictability, which has been notably inconsistent in 2023 and 2024. The German Environmental Agency (UBA) estimates that, without any additional measures, an allowance price of at least EUR 350/tCO2e would be necessary to reduce emissions to the sectoral target (Harthan and Repenning, 2022). The German government’s own projections report (UBA, 2024c) assumes an increase to EUR 125/tCO2e after 2030 and reaching a maximum of EUR 180/tCO2e in 2050.\n",
    "All proceeds from the ETS system will be re-invested into climate protection or returned to citizens. In 2022, the combined revenues of the German ETS and the EU ETS totalled more than EUR 13bn and were channelled into the country’s Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF), which functions as the principal source of climate finance economy-wide (UBA, 2023a). Although the government has agreed to return the revenues of the carbon price to consumers, this payback will likely only happen beginning in 2028. Administrative barriers are one issue, while the fact that the revenues are already planned for other purposes through the KTF is another (Pokraka, 2023).\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "The buildings sector in Germany emitted 102 MtCO2e in 2023, about 15% of Germany’s total emissions. Emissions for 2023 reached a new record low, driven by gas-saving efforts following the suspension of imports from Russia and relatively mild temperatures, and were in line with the sectoral target.\n",
    "Over the years, emissions from this sector have declined, but this has slowed in the last decade. By 2030, the climate change law foresees a limit of 67 MtCO2e for buildings, which the UBA forecasts will be slightly exceeded by 1 MtCO2e (UBA, 2024c).\n",
    "A Climate Action Tracker report stresses the importance of a comprehensive approach to increasing efficiency and speeding up decarbonisation, particularly in the buildings sector (Climate Action Tracker, 2022).\n",
    "The government coalition agreed on a 65% renewable requirement for new heating systems from 2024, and producing 50% of all heat in a GHG-neutral manner by 2030, which would speed up the decarbonisation of the sector. By 2045, all heating systems would need to fully run on GHG-neutral energy (Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK), 2023).\n",
    "A draft law to implement this principle for new heating systems received significant opposition. Subsequently, the government released a watered-down version, which delayed the start of implementation for some regions from 2024 to 2028, and introduced more exceptions and relaxed the use of wood heating.\n",
    "The legislative process for this version faced initial delays due to procedural questions raised by the federal court. Eventually, the law was passed in September 2023. While the proposed law did not specify particular technologies, it effectively aimed to promote the adoption of heat pumps, replacing traditional gas and oil boilers. The law did include some exceptions.\n",
    "While the law's provision for new buildings in new residential areas to meet a 65% renewable energy target for heating systems by 2024 seems like a positive step towards decarbonisation, the option for owners of existing buildings to delay compliance until a municipal heating plan is available raises concerns. This delay could potentially slow down the transition to renewable heating systems, allowing more new fossil fuel-based systems to be installed.\n",
    "The law mandates that municipal heat planning should be completed nationwide by mid-2028. After this point, it will generally not be permissible for heating systems in both new and existing buildings to exclusively rely on fossil fuels for heating systems. Financial support programmes offering up to 70% assistance for transitioning to renewable heating systems are also available (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, 2024).\n",
    "In November 2023, the Bundestag passed the Heat Planning and Decarbonisation of Heating Networks Act, which came into effect in 2024. The legislation requires federal states to develop heating plans for municipalities within their jurisdiction to achieve a greenhouse gas-neutral heat supply by 2045.\n",
    "Plans must be implemented by 2026 for municipalities with populations exceeding 100,000, and by 2028 for those with populations below 100,000. These plans are intended to encourage sustainable and climate-neutral heating solutions. By 2030, half of grid-based heat production is expected to be climate-neutral, and by 2040, 80% of heat is aimed to be sourced from renewable energy or waste heat. (BMWSB, 2023).\n",
    "The recent approval of the EU Building Directive compromise is a positive step, yet the goals for reducing energy consumption could be more ambitious. The directive aims for an average reduction of 16% by 2030 and 20-22% by 2035. However, it falls short of the originally proposed stringent standards; notable is the absence of mandatory renovation requirements (Tagesschau, 2024a). Another concern is the approach to green hydrogen, which the law seems to assume will be available for the buildings sector. Green hydrogen is a very expensive source of energy, meaning its use should be limited to applications without alternatives (NewClimate Institute, 2023). A clear direction for this energy source in the law would provide more certainty to the planning communities and the industry providing the required expertise and technologies.\n",
    "Germany’s national emissions trading scheme “Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz – BEHG” covers all non-ETS sectors, incl. the buildings sector. Companies selling fossil fuels have to purchase certificates for the carbon content of those fuels, and pass on the additional financial burden to the end consumers through an increased price. The scheme started in 2021 with an initial price of EUR 25 per tonne of CO2. It was meant to increase annually, but in 2022 the government postponed the increase because of the high energy prices driven by the illegal invasion of Russia in Ukraine. As of 2024, it is raised to EUR 45 per tonne of CO2.\n",
    "An increasing carbon price will mean that running fossil-based heating systems will cost more over time. This trend is foreseeable to informed building owners, but it can be assumed that most owners will lack knowledge and opt for a system with lower investment costs and a technology they are familiar with, unless they are required to deviate from this by law. In the absence of a clear ban of new fossil heating systems, there is a risk that high prices for fuel will burden many house owners and tenants in the future.\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "The agricultural sector in Germany emitted 59 MtCO2e in 2023, about 8% of Germany’s total emissions. Over the last two decades, emissions in the sector slightly declined, but at a slower rate than most other sectors. The largest source, with about half of the sector’s emissions, is methane released through enteric fermentation of livestock, followed by nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural lands.\n",
    "In 2023, emissions from the agricultural sector remained below the sectoral limit set by the climate change law. For 2030, the climate change law foresees a limit of 57 MtCO2e/yr for agriculture, which the UBA forecasts will be almost met with implemented measures (UBA, 2024c).\n",
    "Emissions in the agriculture sector need to reduce significantly so that Germany can reach climate neutrality by 2045. So far, policies are not in place and agreement with farmers is urgently needed, as they recently have been a stumbling block to new policies.\n",
    "Meat consumption in 2023 decreased by 4% relative to 2022, which was also reflected in reduced production (BMEL, 2024). The level of meat consumption is still clearly above world average and beyond a level that constitutes a healthy diet (Climate Action Tracker, 2018). While demand for meat products is down, plant-based products saw an increasingly strong pick up by German citizens in 2023. Another factor for decreased meat consumption in recent years might be increased food prices as a result of the energy crisis.\n",
    "To decrease the burden of inflation on poorer households and steer nutrition in a healthier and more environmentally sustainable direction, the German Minister for Agriculture proposed waiving the value added tax on plant-based products in early 2023. At the moment, all food products, including meat and dairy products, are taxed at a reduced rate of 7% (as opposed to 19% for other goods and drinks). This measure would need to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, who has not yet picked up this proposal.\n",
    "\n## Waste\n",
    "In 1990 the German waste sector emitted 38 MtCO2e (3% of total emissions). By 2021, emissions were at just 4 MtCO2e - a decrease of 89% and contributing only about 1% of total emissions (UBA, 2023b). This reduction was mainly achieved by ending the disposal of untreated residential waste and the increased utilisation of energy and materials from waste (Umweltbundesamt, 2017). Since 2005, landfilling of biodegradable waste has been prohibited in Germany. From 2024, CO2 emissions from waste incineration are part of the emissions trading scheme for fuels (BEHG).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Historical emissions are taken from the Federal Environment Agency published in March 2024 (UBA, 2024b). UBA provides the data using Global Warming Potentials from AR5, we convert the data using Global Warming Potentials from AR4 (see more detail below).\n",
    "Note there is an unexplained jump from -18 to -80 MtCO2 in sinks from forests in the inventory data from 1990 to 1991.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "The current policy projections are adapted from the projections report (“Projektionsbericht 2024”) published by the kba Agency (UBA) in March 2024, which includes all measures that were agreed by October 2023 (UBA, 2024c). The base year value of 2019 from the projections varies slightly from the latest historical inventory data from 2023, and we harmonise the projections to the inventory by assuming that the relative difference in 2019 for each sector is constant in the future for the projections.\n",
    "UBA provides in their most recent publication the scenario “With implemented measures” . For some sectors, we make corrections to the numbers to reflect most recent policy developments:\n",
    "- Power: The UBA projection assumes that the targeted RE capacity additions set early 2022 will be achieved. For solar, this has been the case, but only about a quarter of the targeted wind capacity for 2023 and 2024 has been installed so far. We thus provide a range for this sector and for the upper end of emissions projections for energy supply assume that only half of the additions of wind will be achieved by 2030 and beyond. This assumption would lead to about 107 GW of wind by 2030, as opposed to 145 GW as targeted. The difference in emissions is about 12 MtCO2 in 2030.",
    "- Transport: The projection report assumes that passenger EV sales will continue to increase every year until 2035: in 2024, registrations of new passenger EVs are projected to increase by 37.7% relative to 2023 and amount to over 720,000 new EVs (KBA, 2023; UBA, 2024a). However, since the publication of the projection report, the German government eliminated its purchase incentives for passenger EVs at the end of 2023. In the first four months of 2024, passenger EV registrations were weaker than expected: only approximately 106,000 passenger EVs have been registered (KBA, 2024b, 2024c, 2024d, 2024a). To consider the lower-than-expected growth in EV registrations, we delay the share of passenger car emissions reduction by one year. Passenger cars accounted for approximately 60% (59.71%) of total road transport emissions between 2018 and 2022 (Eurostat, 2024) Therefore, 60% of sectoral emissions reduction is delayed by one year.",
    "- Buildings, Industry, Agriculture and Waste: no adjustments, using scenario with implemented measures.",
    "\n## Net-zero target and other long-term targets\n",
    "According to Germany’s Climate Law, the 2045 climate neutrality target includes a sink of 40 MtCO2e to compensate for some remaining emissions sources. We thus estimate the total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF in 2045 at 40 MtCO2e.\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potentials values\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Germany has the following national climate change mitigation targets (German Government, 2021a):\n",
    "- 65% national emissions reduction below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF by 2030 (up from 55%)",
    "- a new, interim target of 88% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF by 2040",
    "- climate neutrality by 2045",
    "Germany did not submit its own NDC but is part of the EU’s target of 55% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF and the EU climate neutrality goal for 2050.\n",
    "CAT rates the 2030 target as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways, and “Insufficient” when compared to Germany’s fair share. CAT analysis finds that to be in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement, Germany’s 2030 emissions reduction target should aim for reductions of at least 69% below 1990 levels domestically. To fully contribute its fair share, Germany would also have to significantly increase its international climate finance.\n",
    "The German climate law includes a breakdown of the target to sectors until 2030, but not beyond.\n",
    "*For details on how Climate Action Tracker calculated the target values see the Assumptions tab\n",
    "\n## National target Updates\n",
    "In June 2021, in the wake of a Constitutional Court ruling that Germany’s climate targets were not strong enough, the government adopted an amendment to its 2019 climate law. The court ruled that the previous climate law from 2019 risked delaying action and putting too much burden on future generations, and asked for more clarity on the trajectory beyond 2030.\n",
    "The 2021 amendment of the climate revised the targets as follows (German Government, 2021a):\n",
    "- 65% national emissions reduction below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF by 2030 – up from a 55% reduction in the 2019 climate law",
    "- 88% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF by 2040 – an additional interim goal that was not part of the 2019 climate law",
    "- climate neutrality by 2045 – five years earlier than the 2050 net zero date from the 2019 climate law.",
    "Overall, the amendment includes stronger targets than the original law. The 65% reduction is close to the 69% that CAT suggests as the minimum necessary domestic effort (CAT, 2021).\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target\n",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.\n",
    "Germany does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its national target through domestic action alone. We rate its national target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.\n",
    "National target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "We rate Germany’s 2030 reduction target of 65% below 1990 levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s national target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. While the proposed target represents a significant improvement compared to its previous target, Germany’s new target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvement.\n",
    "National target against fair share\n",
    "We rate Germany’s 2030 target of 65% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s national target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.\n",
    "Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to others to meet its fair-share contribution. Germany’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "Germany’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Germany’s fair share rating.\n",
    "Germany’s international public climate finance contributions are better than most developed countries but still rated “Insufficient.” Germany has committed to increasing its climate finance but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share as assessed by the CAT.\n",
    "To improve its rating, Germany needs to increase its international climate finance contributions by around a factor of three in the period post-2020 and urgently stop funding fossil fuel projects abroad. At COP26, Germany signed a declaration to stop financing fossil fuels abroad, but the sector guidelines for export credits still allows investments in existing and new fossil fuel infrastructure outside Germany's borders (Die Bundesregierung, 2023).\n",
    "Germany is the biggest European climate finance donor. According to the CAT estimates, its contributions represent more than half of the EU contributions. However, due to the high fair share requirements assessed by the CAT, Germany’s current contributions remain “Highly insufficient.”\n",
    "Most German contributions for climate finance are distributed via bilateral development cooperation. Funding is implemented by Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and KfW Development Bank. The International Climate Initiative (IKI) is a separate funding mechanism of the Climate and Economics Ministry (BMWK), the Environment Ministry (BMU), and the Federal Foreign Office (AA). A smaller share is disbursed through contributions to multilateral climate funds. A significant share of the finance takes the form of grants, but Germany also relies on other financial instruments, such as concessional loans (Deutsche Klimafinanzierung, 2021).\n",
    "Germany remains committed to the global USD 100bn goal in climate finance for developing countries per year through 2025, but the USD 100bn goal in itself is insufficient post-2020. At the G7 Summit in June 2021, Germany committed to increase climate finance by EUR 2bn to a total level of EUR 6bn annually by 2025 (Kanzleramt Deutschland, 2021).\n",
    "In 2022, the German government successfully reached its objective of providing more than EUR 6bn for climate finance (BMZ, 2023). The increase in climate finance is due to the growing demand for climate programmes in recipient countries and exceptional factors, such as special funds for food security in Ukraine, which are counted towards the goal. Initially, the government had projected around EUR 4.3 bn annually from 2021 to 2023 (Kowalzig, 2022).\n",
    "However, the forecast for 2023 and 2024 is significantly lower, at around EUR 5.14bn and EUR 5.3bn, respectively. The planned cuts, starting in 2025, are a cause for concern. The German government intends to make further cuts in development cooperation, including climate finance, which will amount to billions of euros. This decision, led by Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner, is part of a worrying trend. These cuts could undermine long-term climate projects, potentially affecting bilateral commitments crucial for climate initiatives in recipient countries (Kowalzig, 2024). In 2023, during the Petersberg Dialogue, Germany announced EUR 2bn of climate finance for the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, a third more than in the previous round (The German Government, 2023).\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker climate finance rating focuses on finance for climate change mitigation, and the data shows an increase in this area over the years, which results in a positive rating of the contribution's trend. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance across all areas is fundamental.\n",

    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law. The net zero target generally covers all key elements but fails to meet best practice standards for some of them. Germany also falls under the European Union net zero target (CAT, 2024).\n",
    "Germany’s target covers all sectors and gases, underpinned by an emissions pathway to 2040 and the communication of binding sectoral targets until 2030. International aviation and shipping remain outside of the target’s scope. A periodic and legally-binding review process of measures and interim targets by an Expert Council is in place. Germany provides separate reduction and removal targets with regards to LULUCF but remains unclear on any other carbon removal. The net zero target is enshrined in law in Germany’s climate law 2021.\n",
    "The German government has failed to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on some key elements of its net zero target. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Germany’s own territory, but the climate law explicitly reserves the right to use international offset credits. Lastly, Germany also fails to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon storage and removal.\n",
