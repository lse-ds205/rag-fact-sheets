    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Nigeria is facing a severe cost-of-living crisis following President Tinubu’s partial removal of fuel subsidies and the devaluation of the Naira, resulting in mass protests and food** **insecurity.** **While the moves were intended to address growing government debt and attract foreign investment into the country, they have left many Nigerians unable to afford food or fuel, at a** **time of great instability in the country's heavily fossil fuel-based energy supply where many rely on petrol-driven generators, and on fuel subsidies to afford them.**\n",
    "**President Tinubu has acknowledged the need to reduce reliance on the oil and gas sector and develop solar power, but has also expressed support for increased oil and gas production for domestic consumption and export, which is unlikely to provide a solution for the current instability of the country's electricity grid.** **A continued reliance on fossil gas as a \"transition\" fuel on the domestic front also risks stranded assets and may delay the energy transition.**\n",
    "**While Nigeria’s policies and targets represent a fair contribution to limiting global warming with its own resources, to actually reduce emissions to a level consistent with 1.5ºC it needs to decarbonise its economy and will require international support to do so. Overall, the CAT rates Nigeria’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”.**\n",
    "In 2024, Nigeria submitted its new Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which confirms their announced target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. However, of the four scenarios in the LT-LEDS, only the Renewable Energy Scenario achieves the net-zero target. The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to achieve net zero by 2060, considered in our planned policies scenario, requires significant international support. The government aimed to secure an initial USD 10 billion support package ahead of COP27 to kickstart implementation, but has not secured sufficient financing as of December 2024.\n",
    "Nigeria has adopted new measures and announced plans to reduce emissions:\n",
    "- The Electricity Act of 2023 aims to address challenges plaguing the power sector by decentralising and privatising the sector and removing barriers to the deployment of minigrids. This may facilitate growth in renewables, which currently account for about 20% of electricity generation, and expand energy access.",
    "- In January 2023, Nigeria adopted new Methane Guidelines that include mandatory measures for oil and gas companies, such as leak detection, to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Methane emissions from oil and gas production accounted for about 13% of emissions in 2023 and have traditionally been a significant source of emissions.",
    "While these are positive developments, the government’s continued reliance on oil and gas risks locking Nigeria into emissions-intensive infrastructure. This will likely lead to the major stranding of assets and misallocation of investment resources and continue to drive up national emissions. To meet its net zero ambitions, Nigeria could:\n",
    "- **Support the uptake of renewables, such as solar home systems and mini-grids**, as people move away from expensive diesel and petrol back-up generators and expand access to unserved areas.",
    "- **Move ahead with implementing the 2021 Climate Change Act** **and clarify key elements of the net zero target**, such as emissions coverage and the role of carbon removals.",
    "- **Avoid locking in high-emission fossil gas infrastructure projects**, such as the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline and additional liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity. With uncertainty in long-term fossil gas demand, these investments are at risk of becoming stranded assets.",
    "According to the IEA, no new oil or gas field development should be undertaken if net zero emissions (NZE) in 2050 is to be achieved. The IEA’s 2022 update of its NZE scenario indicates that African oil and fossil gas production needs to decline by 41% and 13% below 2021 levels by 2030 respectively, and 82% for oil and 78% for gas by 2050. In other words, expanding the availability of oil or fossil gas in Nigeria or anywhere else in the world is inconsistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n",
    "\n## Description of CAT ratings\n",
    "The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.\n",
    "Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.\n",
    "The CAT rates Nigeria’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Nigeria’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.\n",
    "Nigeria’s unconditional target meets its fair share contribution to limit warming to 1.5°C; however, its conditional target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to the level of climate action needed within the country including international support.\n",
    "While Nigeria’s policies and action are 1.5°C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution, they are not on track when compared to the level of climate action needed within the country to meet that warming limit. Nigeria needs additional support to implement additional policies and to strengthen and meet its conditional target.\n",
    "The CAT estimates that Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions would reach 62–72% above 2010 levels excluding LULUCF in 2030 under current policies and including the impact of COVID-19.\n",
    "In August 2022, Nigeria released its Energy Transition Plan (ETP), put forward as the key strategy to achieving its 2060 net zero target; however, the plan relies on significant action after 2030. Former President Buhari has declared the period to 2030 the “Decade of Gas” and current President Tinubu has also expressed strong support for oil and fossil gas.\n",
    "As Nigeria is currently seeking international support to kick-start implementation of the ETP, we have included it in our planned policies scenario rather than in our current policies scenario.\n",
    "Nigeria’s current policies are rated 1.5˚C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution from its own resources. The “1.5˚C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond Nigeria’s fair share with international support.\n",
    "While Nigeria’s policies and action are consistent with a fair contribution to climate action, they do not put Nigeria on track to meet either of its targets. These policies are also inconsistent with the level of emissions cuts needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Implementation of the ETP, reflected in our planned policies scenario, would put Nigeria on track to meets its unconditional target, but not its conditional target. Nigeria will need to implement additional policies with its own resources to meet its unconditional target but will also need international support to implement policies in line with full decarbonisation to meet and exceed its conditional target.\n",
    "Key steps to reducing the gap between current policies and Nigeria’s NDC targets include progressing towards and ramping up its renewable energy target and halting the expansion of fossil gas.\n",
    "In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria committed to reducing emissions by 47% below BAU by 2030, conditional on international support. This is equivalent to an emissions level 2% above to 15% below 2010 levels by 2030 excluding LULUCF. While this is a strong conditional target, Nigeria will need to strengthen its policies to make sure it has the enabling conditions in place to meet the target, in addition to receiving international support.\n",
    "The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 conditional target as “Almost sufficient,” a rating that indicates that Nigeria’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Nigeria’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "Nigeria’s conditional target spans the CAT’s “Almost sufficient” and 1.5°C compatible ratings. The large target range is due to uncertainty around the extent to which Nigeria plans to rely on the land sector in meeting its target. Further clarity from Nigeria on this may result in a 1.5°C compatible target.\n",
    "When the latest version of the modelled domestic pathways (MDPs) were produced in March 2024, they were harmonised to the latest historical data available at the time. Since then, Nigeria has revised their estimate of historical emissions, resulting in a gap in 2019 between the MDPs and historical data. This discrepancy will be addressed in the next update.\n",
    "In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria recommitted to unconditionally reducing emissions 20% below BAU by 2030. This is equivalent to an emissions level of 28-35% above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF) by 2030. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 unconditional target as 1.5°C compatible when compared to what its fair share contribution is.\n",
    "The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "The fair share literature for Nigeria is sparse and some equity categories have few data points. As a result, the upper bound of Nigeria’s fair share range is dominated by a handful of studies. This high range is not reflective of much of the literature, which indicates more stringent emission reductions. Future equity studies may help to improve the fair share analysis for Nigeria.\n",
    "In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act that seeks to achieve greenhouse gas emissions in line with carbon budgets with green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a target to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070. At COP26, former President Buhari further committed to net zero emissions by 2060, which would be in line with the Climate Change Act.\n",
    "Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan, released August 2022, was developed to serve as the pathway towards achieving the 2060 net zero target. As the Act only sets the framework for adopting a net zero GHG target between 2050 and 2070, the final net zero target could improve on several elements. In particular, the target should clarify emissions coverage, review process, and the role of carbon removals in achieving the target. We evaluate the target design as “Average”.\n",

    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**\n",
    "In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act that seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions, green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a target to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070 (Okereke & Onuigbo, 2021). The Act includes provisions to adopt National Climate Change Action Plans in five-year cycles (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021). The Action Plans, to be implemented by the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) established by the Act, are meant to ensure national emissions are consistent with a carbon budget. The carbon budgets are to be set by the federal ministries responsible for the environment and national planning and periodically reviewed.\n",
    "The government has not met the initial deadlines set in the Act. Under the Act, the pilot Action Plan and first carbon budget should have been published by November 2022; however, as of December 2024 this has not happened and several other milestones were delayed (Adebote, 2022; Ailemen, 2023). President Tinubu also appointed a new Director-General of the NCCC in June 2024, pending confirmation by the NCCC Supervisory Council (Ngelale, 2024).\n",
    "At COP26, former President Buhari further committed to net zero emissions by 2060, which would be in line with the Climate Change Act (Lo, 2021).\n",
    "Nigeria’s August 2022 Energy Transition Plan (ETP) was developed to serve as the pathway towards achieving the 2060 net zero target (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022). In February 2023, the integration of the Energy Transition Plan and Office into the NCCC was approved to ensure continuity of the plan with the Climate Change Act. Following his confirmation in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu further emphasised that Nigeria was committed to achieving net zero emissions in line with the Climate Change Act (Tinubu, 2023).\n",
    "Nigeria has also launched a long-term vision to 2050, which informed the development of its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) (Akinola, 2021; DCC, 2021). The LT-LEDS was submitted in 2024 and includes a revised vision statement, adapted from the long-term vision to 2050, noting the 2060 commitment applies “across all sectors” (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).\n",
    "The LT-LEDS also introduces several scenarios, including the Renewable Energy Scenario (RES) which is the only scenario to achieve the 2060 commitment and align with the long-term vision goal of reducing emissions 50% by 2050. However, the Current Policy Scenario, which assumes “an economy guided by the ambition of the ETP (Net-Zero by 2060) and the NDC”, does not achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. The LT-LEDS says this is because the ETP does not cover AFOLU emissions (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Nigeria’s Climate Change Act seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emission, green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a net zero GHG target between 2050 and 2070 (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021). Nigeria’s NDC update mentions aiming to reach net zero as early as possible in the second half of the century. At COP26, former President Buhari committed to achieving net zero by 2060, also included in Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan and Long-Term-Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) and reaffirmed by President Tinubu (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022; Lo, 2021). We take Nigeria’s target year to be 2060 as indicated in the LT-LEDS.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all Kyoto gases except NF3 (Art. 35 of the Act). No data is available for the level of NF3 emissions, but other F-gases represent less than half a percent of Nigeria’s emissions. The Act does not specify sectoral emissions coverage, but as the corresponding carbon budget should be set \"for Nigeria.\" The LT-LEDS says Nigeria will achieve net-zero emissions “across all sectors”, thus we assume the target is economy-wide.",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – The Act does not include any information on international aviation and shipping. The LT-LEDS mentions international aviation only as an example within the context of voluntary carbon markets, not including any information on how international aviation and shipping are included in the target.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The Act applies to entities within the territorial boundaries of Nigeria and the Environment Ministry is required to set a carbon budget for Nigeria. We interpret these provisions to mean that Nigeria’s target is focused on cutting emissions within its own borders. The government should clarify its intent to achieve net zero emissions domestically.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act, which seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions and green and sustainable growth by providing a framework to set a net-zero GHG target between 2050 and 2070 (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021). The carbon budget and Action Plan, required within a year of the adoption of the Act, have not yet been released. Following the launch of the Long-Term Vision, in 2024 Nigeria submitted a Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which includes a net zero GHG target of 2060 (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Nigeria has not provided any information on whether it will establish separate emission reduction and removal targets.",
    "- **Review process** – · Nigeria’s Climate Change Act includes detailed provisions for periodically revising its carbon budget as well as its Action Plan. The federal ministries responsible for environment and for national planning are required to present a carbon budget and determine the budgetary period one year after the act was signed into law, by November 2022. However, as of December 2024, we have not been able to identify a carbon budget.A new carbon budget must subsequently be produced one year before the end of the current carbon budget cycle. The Secretariat of the National Council on Climate Change must also produce an Action Plan to ensure national emissions are consistent with the carbon budget every five years. The Action Plan must include a carbon budget in line with the five-year cycle and annual carbon budgets for each year in the cycle.The Secretariat must also regularly report to the National Assembly on the state of implementation of the Plan. The Act also establishes obligations on public and private entities to achieve targets and consequences for failing to do so.The Act does not, however, specify a process for reviewing the net zero target itself.",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Nigeria’s Climate Change Act does not provide any information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on domestic carbon dioxide removals to meet its net zero target (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021).The Act, however, includes text on the promotion of nature-based solutions, the establishment of a REDD+ Registry and development of natural capital accounts to be used by government bodies in policy and action plan formulation in line with the carbon budget. The RES scenario in the LT-LEDS, the only scenario to reach net zero, assumes reforestation under the National Forestry Policy would achieve a carbon sink of 70 MtCO2 by 2060 (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – Under the Act, the federal ministries responsible for environment and for national planning are required to set a 1.5°C consistent carbon budget. The Act includes provisions to develop National Climate Change Action Plans every five years to be ratified by the Federal Executive Council that will be overseen by the National Council on Climate Change. The Action Plans aim to ensure national emissions are consistent with the carbon budget and should include annual carbon budgets for each year in the five-year cycle. A pilot Action Plan should have been adopted by November 2022; however, as of December 2024, a plan has not yet been presented (Ailemen, 2023). Nigeria also released its Energy Transition Plan in August 2022. The plan is expected to serve as Nigeria’s pathway to achieve its 2060 net zero target (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022). This pathway is further supported by the LT-LEDS, which includes three emissions scenarios, of which only the Renewable Energy Scenario, achieves net zero emissions by 2060.",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The Act does not include any information pertaining to the fairness of Nigeria’s target.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",

    "# Policies & action",
    "The CAT estimates that Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions would reach 62-72% above 2010 levels excluding LULUCF in 2030 under current policies and including the impact of COVID-19.\n",
    "Nigeria’s current policies are rated 1.5°C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nigeria’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.\n",

    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Emission levels from current policy trajectory are on course to be between 544-672 MtCO2e in 2035, compared to 430-454 MtCO2e this year 2025. Under current policy projections, emissions are increasing at a rate of about 0.02% per year.\n",
    "Nigeria's 2021 NDC update includes an unconditional target of between 368-388 MtCO2e by 2030, but the country is not projected to meet this target with current policies. The Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, published in 2023, sets a net zero target year of 2060 within the framework of the Climate Change Act (National Climate Change Council, 2023a). The plan targets significant long-term action through sectoral targets; however, it relies heavily on action after 2030.\n",
    "Under the 2021 Climate Change Act, the government is required to develop a carbon tax and carbon trading. In February 2023, the Director General of the National Council on Climate Change announced plans to unveil a carbon tax policy (Gupte, 2023). The policy remains in the planning phase and has not yet been implemented.\n",
    "The government has recently commenced work on its Second Biennial Transparency Report and Fourth National Communication (BTR2/NC4), raising hopes of further movement on the implementation of climate programs (EnviroNews Nigeria, 2025). New elections for the presidency are not expected before 2027.\n",
    "The National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and updated NDC both identify AFOLU as a significant source of emissions. About 70% of these emissions come from burning biomass for energy production, with nearly three quarters of households in 2016 using wood fuels for cooking (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2020). The government's National Gas Expansion Programme aims to convert over 30 million homes from wood fuels to liquified petroleum gas, but no significant developments have been observed yet (Economic Sustainability Committee, 2020).\n",
    "\n## Power sector\n",
    "In 2024 fossil gas supplied about 80% of electricity generation in Nigeria’s power sector (Ember, 2024). The remaining 20% is supplied by hydropower and negligible shares of solar PV. Coal does not play a role in Nigeria’s electricity supply, and is thus evaluated as \"**Coal free**.\" While a 600 MW coal-fired plant has been permitted, lack of construction activity and ongoing land-use conflicts make it highly unlikely this plant will ever be constructed or brought online (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).\n",
    "Nigeria's electricity supply is one of the least reliable in Africa, with the most frequent and prolonged power outages on the continent (IEA, 2019a). These reliability issues contribute to Nigeria's high reliance on expensive oil-fired back-up generators, with households and businesses spending nearly USD 22 billion annually on fuel for generators, or about 5% of 2022 GDP (Dzirutwe, 2022; IMF, 2024). Additionally, Nigeria has the largest population of people without access to electricity, at roughly 88 million in 2023, about 40% of the population (World Bank et al., 2023). The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) identifies the elimination of diesel and petrol generators as the key strategy for the power sector, aiming for universal electricity access by 2030. While the long-term plan targets significant solar PV expansion by 2050, in the short-term the ETP relies on fossil gas as a \"transition fuel,\" risking investment in stranded assets and locking in carbon-intensive infrastructure (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2016).\n",
    "\n### Fossil gas\n",
    "Fossil gas dominates Nigeria's power system, supplying roughly 80% of on-grid electricity generation in 2024 (Ember, 2024). However, due to frequent blackouts, many rely on back-up diesel and petrol generators. With the removal of fuel subsidies (see transport section for more information) and resulting high cost of petrol, Nigerians are seeking cheaper alternatives including solar PV and converting their generators to run on gas (Adebayo, 2023; Olawin, 2023). Fossil gas generation in Nigeria has remained largely stagnant over the last five years, while its share in the overall power mix has been decreasing. However, significant planned capacity additions are pushing fossil gas generation in Nigeria in the \"**Wrong direction**.\"\n",
    "Nigeria does not have a comprehensive fossil gas phase-out target for power generation. The Energy Transition Plan presents a mixed approach: it targets a reduction in oil and gas generation from \"decentralised\" generators from 5.3 GW in 2020 to 3.2 GW in 2030, with a full phase-out by 2050. However, for centralised power generation, the ETP positions fossil gas as a \"transition fuel\" with plans to expand fossil gas generation. Specifically, the ETP expects to ramp up available centralised gas capacity from 4 GW in 2020 to 14 GW by 2030 and anticipates 10 GW of gas capacity remaining in the power mix by mid-century.\n",
    "This approach is not aligned with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The CAT’s 1.5°C compatible benchmarks see Nigeria phasing down gas to between 1-15% share of power generation by 2040 and completely phased out by 2045 (NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, 2024). Relying on fossil gas runs the risk of investing in stranded assets as future gas demand is subject to large uncertainties.\n",
    "Recent developments include the commencement of construction on the 1.3 GW Gwagwalada Independent fossil gas power plant in 2023. However, Nigeria's high reliance on fossil gas for power has contributed to the instability of the grid. In addition to poor infrastructure, gas supply disruptions from vandalism or financial trouble cause blackouts and reduce power generation (NewsDirect, 2024; Okechukwu Nnodim, 2024; Wiliams et al., 2024).\n",
    "Nigeria's Long-Term Low-Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) introduces strategies to reduce power sector emissions and emphasises uptake of combined cycle gas plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the acceleration of CCS integration and standardisation for widespread implementation across the power and oil & gas sectors. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to technologies which use engineered methods to capture CO2 from a source and store it geologically; however, these technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.\n",
    "\n### Renewables\n",
    "Renewable energy generation in Nigeria has shown minimal growth over the last five years, with essentially no growth in wind and solar and other renewables (primarily hydropower) increasing minimally. The share of renewables in the overall power mix has also barely changed over the last five years. Nigeria's target of over 23 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, outlined in the 2015 NREEEP, is ambitious but implementation has been extremely slow, with only 21 MW of renewable capacity added between 2015 and 2022. The Energy Transition Plan sets longer-term targets of nearly 200 GW of solar PV by 2050 but lacks concrete near-term implementation measures. We evaluate progress in this sector as \"**Barely moving**.\"\n",
    "The Economic Sustainability Plan includes measures to install solar power in five million homes by 2023, though there is little information on progress towards this target. Initial funding was announced in 2021, and in March 2023, the Rural Electrification Agency was working to attract further investment to connect underserved areas to the grid (Akande, 2022; Shetty, 2023).\n",
    "To be 1.5°C compatible, CAT benchmarks see the share of renewables in Nigeria’s power mix increasing to 55-71% by 2030 and continuing on a steep incline to 85-99% by 2040 (NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, 2024). Nigeria will need significant international support to achieve a transition at this scale.\n",
    "CAT analysis shows that shifting to renewables would not only put Nigeria on a 1.5°C compatible pathway, but would also create more jobs than its current gas-based strategy. Nigeria's Long-Term Low-Emission Development Strategy introduces scenarios for renewable energy development, with the Renewable Energy Scenario being the only one that achieves Nigeria's 2060 net zero goal. However, these scenarios are largely illustrative and lack concrete implementation plans.\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "\n### Oil & gas production\n",
    "Nigeria, a member of OPEC, was the 15th largest oil producer in the world in 2023 (US EIA, 2024). Nigeria is also the 19th largest natural gas producer in the world and plans to increase current production threefold (IEA, 2021a; The Guardian, 2021). The country’s economy is highly dependent on its oil and gas sector, accounting for about 40% of government revenue in 2021 (Central Bank of Nigeria, 2021). Despite the recovery of oil prices, this share is down from about 54% of government revenue in 2019, largely due to low oil and gas production.\n",
    "Crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism has surged in recent years, impacting oil and gas production and government revenues (Central Bank of Nigeria, 2021). In October 2023, crude oil production reached 1.35 million barrels per day (bpd) against a benchmark of 1.69 million bpd. National Security Adviser Nihu Ribadu stated that as of 2023 Nigeria loses up to 400,000 barrels of crude oil per day to theft (Ships & Ports, 2023). The Nigerian government has engaged the military to support monitoring and operations to crack down on systematic and widespread theft and illegal refining (Omeje, 2024).\n",
    "These issues of theft and vandalism, among other reasons such as militant activity, have led international oil companies (IOCs) to divest from their assets in Nigeria, largely selling to domestic Nigerian firms (Stakeholder Democracy Network, 2021). Reports have indicated that divestments of IOCs to domestic companies have exacerbated pollution and increased flaring in the Delta (Chason, 2023). This raised concerns over how to hold IOCs accountable for the oil spills after they exit the region (Stakeholder Democracy Network, 2021).\n",
    "While IOCs have been divesting in assets since the early 2010s, there has been a renewed surge of sales in recent years (Stakeholder Democracy Network, 2021). In 2021, Shell announced its intent to sell its stake in onshore oilfields. However, in October 2024, Nigeria’s oil regulator rejected the sale as the buyer was determined unfit to manage the assets (Bousso, 2022b, 2022a; Reuters, 2024). Nigerian communities and organisations also opposed the sale until Shell is held accountable for environmental damages (Ajala, 2024; Shell, 2024). Other IOCs including French TotalEnergies and Italian firm Eni have sold onshore assets, with ExxonMobil also attempting to sell all shallow water assets in Nigeria (Egbejule, 2022; Onsat, 2024; Stakeholder Democracy Network, 2021).\n",
    "Despite supply challenges, European interest in importing natural gas from Africa surged amid the global energy crisis (Aljazeera, 2022). This has spurred renewed interest in export infrastructure projects even though new export infrastructure would not be operational in time to counter the short-term impacts of the crisis (Rahhou, 2022).\n",
    "The conflict between Algeria and Morocco has also led both countries to push ahead with competing gas pipelines that would connect Nigeria to Europe: the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline and the Trans-Saharan pipeline that passes through Algeria (France 24, 2023).\n",
    "Despite the significant challenges and costs faced by the Trans-Saharan pipeline, Nigeria continues to push new pipeline projects, with President Tinubu signing a gas pipeline project agreement with Equatorial Guinea in August of 2024 (Onuah, 2024; Sofiullahi, 2024).\n",
    "This rise in the use of fossil gas in Africa, and globally, is not aligned with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Relying on fossil gas runs the risk of investing in stranded assets, as future gas demand is subject to large uncertainties. CAT analysis shows that shifting to renewables would not only put Nigeria on a 1.5°C compatible pathway, but would also create more jobs than its current gas-based strategy.\n",
    "Nigeria’s COVID-19 stimulus plan, the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), includes a domestic gas utilisation programme aimed at reducing the country’s reliance on oil (Economic Sustinability Committee, 2020). This includes the promotion of compressed natural gas (CNG) for use in the transport sector. In May 2024, state oil firm NNPC announced it was commissioning six CNG stations, with the first in Lagos expected to have a capacity of up to 5.2 million standard cubic feet of CNG per day (Eboh, 2024).\n",
    "In August 2021, former President Buhari signed the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) into law to improve transparency and accountability in the oil sector and ultimately attract more international investment in the sector (Esiedesa, 2021; Thomas, 2020). This comes after 20 years of attempts to pass the bill, which has received criticism for potential environmental and social impacts (Ene, 2018; EnviroNews Nigeria, 2021; Iroanusi, 2021; KPMG in Nigeria, 2021). However, increased expansion of oil infrastructure and production increases the risk of costly stranded assets as countries and private sector actors divest from fossil fuels (CCAC Secretariat, 2023).\n",
    "Gas flaring\n",
    "In 2000, Nigeria was flaring roughly 55% of the gas it was extracting. To reduce emissions from gas flaring, Nigeria set the goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2020, a decade ahead of the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative. In 2018, Nigeria further adopted a gas flare commercialisation programme based on the “polluter pays” principle (Ogunleye, Banks, and Legarreta 2019). While Nigeria did not meet its 2020 target, it has made significant progress, now flaring only 10% of extracted gas. The ETP targets zero flaring by 2030, as well as a 95% reduction of fugitive emissions from oil and gas by 2050 (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022).\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "The Nigerian government has made repeated attempts to remove subsidies for premium motor spirit fuels (petrol), as it accounts for a significant portion of the government’s budget. In response to COVID-19, Nigeria announced the removal of petrol subsidies in 2020, but this was not achieved (Official Gazette, 2020). Uncertainty and confusion over government pricing-induced fuel shortages, likely due to a price hike by depot owners in anticipation of higher prices as international oil prices rebound (Olawoyin, 2021). Nigeria had announced a similar removal of subsidies in 2016 after a fall in oil prices but returned to subsidising petrol in 2017 when crude prices rebounded.\n",
    "In 2023, President Tinubu announced the removal of petrol subsidies, with fixed prices for different regions as a key part of his policy platform (Brnic & McColloch, 2023).\n",
    "Petrol prices have now essentially doubled across Nigeria, contributing significantly to the cost-of-living crisis. Facing significant public pushback and street protests, President Tinubu partially reinstated the subsidy from February 2024 by capping fuel prices, as confirmed by the IMF[MOU4] (Norways & Tracey-Cook, 2024). However, the official position of the Tinubu administration is that the subsidy has not be reinstated, even as President Tinubu approved the transfer of roughly USD 1.3bn in revenues back to NNPC to partially cover the USD 4.9bn subsidy debt NNPC says it is owed for the first two quarters of 2024 (Adeuyi, 2024; Agbetiloye, 2024).\n",
    "Fuel subsidies represent a significant strain on limited government resources and support the continued use of fossil fuels; however, the impact of removing these subsidies, particularly on vulnerable groups, needs to be mitigated to ensure a just transition. Shifting to electric vehicles (EVs) and expanding public transport systems can reduce demand for petrol and limit the need for subsidies.\n",
    "The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) sets the target to achieve 100% EVs by 2060, but progress towards this goal is largely expected to happen after 2030 (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022). The ETP targets increased biofuel blend rates of 10% by 2030 and 30% by 2036.\n",
    "Nigeria’s COVID-19 stimulus plan, the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), includes a domestic gas utilisation programme aimed at reducing the country’s reliance on oil (Economic Sustinability Committee, 2020). This includes the promotion of compressed natural gas (CNG) for use in the transport sector. However, CNG is not mentioned in the ETP transport strategy.\n",
    "Nigeria’s National Action Plan to Reduce Short-lived Pollutants includes measures to limit emissions from the transport sector (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2019). It includes measures to eliminate the use of high-emitting vehicles, including a ban on vehicle imports more than 15 years old (implemented) and increasingly stringent emission standards (Euro III by 2023, Euro IV by 2030). The plan also aims to renew the urban bus fleet in Lagos and adopt CNG buses across Nigeria, introduce low sulphur diesel and petrol, and promote a shift from road to rail and water transport. (Adeuyi, 2024; Agbetiloye, 2024; Brnic & McColloch, 2023; Norways & Tracey-Cook, 2024; Official Gazette, 2020; Olawoyin, 2021).\n",
    "There is significant uncertainty around land use and forestry emissions estimates in Nigeria. The country’s Third National Communication (TNC) estimates LULUCF contributes to roughly half of Nigeria’s emissions (over 300 MtCO2e in 2016), while the NDC update reports land use emissions together with agriculture as about one quarter of emissions (approximately 87 MtCO2e in 2018). More recently, the LT-LEDS shows the 2018 share of land use and agricultural emissions at 30%, or 126 MtCO2e (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2020, 2021b; National Climate Change Council, 2023a).\n",
    "Traditional biomass is Nigeria’s largest source of primary energy. In 2016, almost three quarters of households used fuelwood for cooking (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2020). Nigeria’s National Gas Expansion Programme, part of the Economic Sustainability Plan in response to COVID-19, aims to convert over 30 million homes from traditional fuels such as wood and kerosene to liquified petroleum gas to reduce emissions (Economic Sustinability Committee, 2020).\n",
    "Nigeria’s TNC estimated CO₂ emissions from biomass consumption for energy production were about 70% of agriculture, forestry and other land use emissions (42% of total emissions) (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2020). The use of traditional biomass for cooking is linked to indoor air pollution and associated health risks as well as gender labour inequities (Addo & Olajide, 2021; Uchenna & Oluwabunmi, 2020).\n",
    "In 2020, a new National Forest Policy was approved by the Federal Executive Council that is expected to boost climate efforts in the country, but the policy is not available online. As summarised in the LT-LEDS, the policy includes a target to increase forest cover from the current 6% to 25% by 2030 (National Climate Change Council, 2023a).\n",
    "From 2001 to 2016, Nigeria’s tree cover decreased by 9.4%, largely due to shifting agricultural lands (Global Forest Watch, 2021). In July 2021, Nigeria launched its National Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) Strategy with the aim of reducing forest sector emissions by 20% by 2050 (Federal Ministry of Environment, 2021a; Olugbode, 2021). Pilot REDD+ activities have already progressed in Cross River State, home to half of Nigeria’s forests (FME & UNDP, 2019). Cross River State has developed its own REDD+ strategy and approach to safeguards and submitted its forest reference emission level to the UNFCCC.\n",
    "Nigeria is a member state of the Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative. The initiative, launched in 2007 by the African Union, aims to restore degraded land, sequester carbon and create green jobs across in the Sahel region. A key goal of Nigeria’s GGW programme is the establishment of a 1,359 km contiguous shelterbelt to serve as windbreaks from Kebbi State in the northwest to Borno State in the northeast (UNCCD, n.d.). From 2007 to 2020, the programme established 709 km of windbreaks and created 2,801 hectares of reforested land and 1,396 jobs (Climatekos gGmbH & UNCCD, 2020; UNCCD, 2023).\n",
    "\n## Methane\n",
    "Nigeria is a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, and in 2023 joined the Global Methane Pledge Champions alongside the EU, United states, Japan, Germany, Federated States of Micronesia and Canada (Climate & Clean Air Coalition, 2023).\n",
    "In 2023, Nigeria produced roughly 139 MtCO2e of methane emissions (Gütschow et al., 2024). Fugitive methane from the energy sector accounted for about 13% of Nigeria’s emissions (excl. LULUCF) in the same year. Nigeria’s 2021 NDC Update and LT-LEDS focus on reducing fugitive methane emissions and leaks in the oil and gas sector, targeting a 60% reduction by 2031. Within the Agricultural sector, the second largest source of methane emissions, Nigeria’s LT-LEDS focuses on strategies to reduce enteric fermentation and improve livestock waste management without specifically mentioning methane emissions or setting a methane emissions reduction target.\n",
    "In 2023, Nigeria put forward new Methane Guidelines for the oil and gas sector to help reduce fugitive emissions. The guidelines mandate measures such as leak detection, repairs and high destruction efficiency flares. According to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) that provided support developing the guidelines, support will be needed to ensure implementation and enforcement (CCAC Secretariat, 2023).\n",
    "CCAC and the Nigerian government continue to cooperate on stakeholder engagement and education activities to support the implementation of the guidelines, including hosting trainings on leak detection and repair and the use of online tools to estimate methane emissions (Aminu, 2024; Emeh, 2024).\n",
    "Additionally, Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) is currently in the process of developing a Satellite-based Methane Emission Tracker (SMET) to support data-gathering, benchmarking efforts, and identification of leaks and fugitive methane emissions across Nigeria (Mahmoud, 2024).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Nigeria’s Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) provides revised historical emissions for 2018, which was used as the base year in Nigeria’s 2021 updated NDC. The LT-LEDS does not specify what global warming potentials (GWPs) were used. We therefore assume GWPs from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) were used in line with Nigeria’s NDC update (National Climate Change Council, 2023b). We converted 2018 emissions to GWPs from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) using sector-by-sector gas shares from PRIMAP for the same year (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).\n",
    "The LT-LEDS does not provide the share of land use emissions out of its reported agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions in 2018; however, this breakdown is provided for 2020 emissions under the LT-LEDS’s business-as-usual scenario. To exclude LULUCF emissions from our 2018 estimate, we assume no change in the share of land use emissions between 2018 and 2020 and apply this share to 2018 AFOLU emissions (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).\n",
    "Overall, this results in a significant upwards revision of 2018 emissions levels from previous assessments which used 2018 data from Nigeria’s NDC Update. The LT-LEDS notes that the change in 2018 emissions estimates was largely due to changes in transport and AFOLU estimates.\n",
    "To extend the historical time series, we used PRIMAP sector growth rates, both back to 1990 and forwards to 2022.\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "Nigeria’s NDC update uses global warming potentials (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). CAT uses GWP values from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) to ensure comparability across countries.\n",
    "The NDC provides a sector-by-sector breakdown of emissions in 2018 and 2030 under its BAU scenario. We have converted from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for each sector from PRIMAP for the year 2018. We have not converted HFCs as we do not have information on individual gases; however, these gases represent only 1 MtCO2e in 2018. We then apply the growth rates of each sector from the reported AR5 BAU to our new 2018 value to estimate 2030 BAU emissions in AR4. As the LT-LEDS provides revised historical emissions for 2018, which was used as the base year in Nigeria’s 2021 updated NDC, we apply this data with the NDC BAU scenario harmonised to the updated LT-LEDS historical data.\n",
    "The final NDC update provides LULUCF emissions for 2018 and AFOLU emissions for the 2030 BAU. To estimate LULUCF emissions in the 2030 BAU, we applied the same ratio of LULUCF/AFOLU as in 2018.\n",
    "The update provides no information on the extent to which Nigeria intends to rely on reducing land sector emissions to meet its NDC targets. However, the update does estimate the potential of nature-based solutions as about 115 MtCO2e. Of these solutions, the top three are identified as agroforestry, improved forest management, and forest restoration, making up about 89 MtCO2e of the total potential. We use the 89 MtCO2e estimate as the upper bound of our estimate for the contribution of the land sector in meeting Nigeria’s conditional target and a proportional share of the 89 MtCO2e estimate for the unconditional target. We assume this estimate is all CO2 and thus there is no need to convert from AR5 values.\n",
    "For the lower bound, we assume the land sector contributes an equal share as remaining sectors for both targets.\n",
    "The Third National Communication identified significant abatement potential in the land sector, though its estimation of land sector emissions may have been higher than what is now reported in the final NDC update. Overall, there is significant uncertainty in the land sector emissions and our estimates are best guesses based on the available data.\n",
    "Analysis of the NDC covers CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases, which are included in Nigeria’s NDC target. Our assessment of historic emissions and current policies also includes PFCs and SF6, which were around 1 MtCO2e in 2018.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "We derive our current policy projections from a combination of the Stated Policies Scenario from IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 and the Planned Energy Scenario from IRENA’s 2023 Renewable Energy Roadmap Nigeria for energy emissions, the US EPA for agriculture and waste emissions, and the US EPA and Energy Transition Plan for industry emissions. (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022; IEA, 2019a; IRENA, 2023b; US EPA, 2019). In general, the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report does not specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2022 did not contain updated country level data, hence why we have continued to use the 2019 report (IEA, 2019b).\n",
    "The IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario was used to derive our lower bound projections for energy CO2 emissions. This scenario assumes development of coal-fired generation in Nigeria; however, all recent coal plant projects have either been cancelled or shelved. Therefore, we have adjusted our lower bound to assume the coal generation in the Stated Policies Scenario is met with renewable energy, in line with national targets. For the upper bound, IRENA’s Planned Energy Scenario was used for energy CO2 emissions. In our lower and upper bound, projections for energy CH4 and N2O are extended using recent historical trends.\n",
    "We have adjusted the energy emission projections from the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 to take into consideration the impact of the pandemic. We distilled the emission intensity (GHG emissions/GDP) from the pre-pandemic IEA scenario starting in 2019. This emission intensity estimate was then applied to the most recent GDP projections from the IMF for Nigeria that take into account the effect of the pandemic (IMF, 2022). As these estimates only cover 2024 to 2029, we used the average GDP growth projected by the IMF for this period to extend the projections until 2035. Results were then harmonised to our 2022 estimate (see Historical emissions above). The IRENA Planned Energy Scenario already considers the impact of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n## Planned policy projections\n",
    "Our planned policy minimum and maximum scenarios assume implementation of the Energy Transition Plan (ETP) which Nigeria released in August 2022 and for which it will need international support to implement, and the LT-LEDS Current Policies Scenario (CPS) (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022; National Climate Change Council, 2023b)\n",
    "For the lower bound of these projections, we use the ETP’s growth rates for energy and industry emissions and the US EPA projection growth rates as proxies for the agriculture and waste sectors. For the upper bound, we use growth rates for energy and industry from the LT-LEDS Current Policies Scenario (CPS), which incorporates Nigeria’s NDC and the ETP (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2022; National Climate Change Council, 2023b).\n",
    "\n## Net-zero target\n",
    "Nigeria has not provided detailed information about how it intends to reach its net zero target.\n",
    "We have quantified the target for the purposes of our ‘Optimistic’ global temperature estimate. We assume Nigeria reaches net zero emissions by 2060, in line with the LT-LEDS and the announcement of former President Buhari at COP26. LULUCF is assumed to be a 70 MtCO2e sink in 2060 based on the Renewable Energy Scenario (RES) in the LT-LEDS, which is the only scenario given that reaches net zero in 2060. Emissions in 2060 are therefore assumed to be 70 MtCO2e when excluding LULUCF (National Climate Change Council, 2023b).\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potentials\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Nigeria submitted its updated NDC in July 2021 (Federal Government of Nigeria, 2021) (Federal Government of Nigeria, 2021). The update included a substantially revised business-as-usual (BAU) projection for 2030, half of what was projected in Nigeria’s first NDC submission.\n",
    "Nigeria is committed to reducing its emissions by 20% below BAU by 2030 (incl. LULUCF) unconditionally and will reduce its emissions by up to 47% below BAU by 2030, conditional on international support.\n",
    "The CAT estimates that the unconditional target equates to an emissions level of 368-388 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 (28-35% above 2010 levels) and the conditional target equates to 244-294 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2030 (2% above to 15% below 2010 levels). There is a high degree of uncertainty in these estimates due to a lack of information on projected land sector emissions in 2030, and the extent to which this sector contributes to the NDC target. Due to this uncertainty, we estimate the targets excluding LULUCF using a range of assumptions on the contribution from the land sector (see Assumptions for more details).\n",
    "Nigeria submitted its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy in 2023, setting a net zero GHG target of 2060 (National Climate Change Council, 2023a).\n",
    "*For details on what we do for our Optimistic Target global temperature estimate, see the Assumptions tab.\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "Nigeria did not increase ambition in its 2021 NDC Update.\n",
    "In July 2021, Nigeria submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that reiterates its unconditional target of 20% below BAU by 2030 submitted in the 2017 NDC and increases the conditional target from 45% to 47% below BAU by 2030 (Federal Government of Nigeria, 2021) (Federal Government of Nigeria, 2021). The update provided revised historical data with a significantly lower BAU, about half the level of the original. The CAT uses these reductions and the revised BAU in its assessment of Nigeria’s NDC.\n",
    "Nigeria has also expanded the gas coverage of its NDC to include HFCs and proposes to undertake abatement measures in the waste sector, which were not considered in the first NDC.\n",
    "* The CAT began tracking Nigeria in October 2021 after its first NDC update.\n",
    "- 30.07.2021: Nigeria submits a stronger NDC target",
    "- 27.05.2021: Positive signals in Nigeria’s interim update, but significant uncertainties remain",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "Nigeria has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it aims to achieve using its own resources (unconditional target) and one that requires international support (conditional target). We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways. Developing countries like Nigeria will need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with least-cost modelled domestic pathways achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.\n",
    "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria committed to reducing emissions by 47% below BAU by 2030, conditional on international support. This is equivalent to an emissions level of 2% above to 15% below 2010 levels by 2030, excluding LULUCF. While this is a strong conditional target, Nigeria will need to strengthen its policies to make sure it has the enabling conditions in place to meet the target, in addition to receiving international support.\n",
    "The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Nigeria’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Nigeria’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "Nigeria’s conditional target spans the CAT’s “Almost sufficient” and 1.5°C compatible ratings. The large target range is due to uncertainty around the extent to which Nigeria plans to rely on the land sector in meeting its target. Further clarity from Nigeria on this may result in a 1.5°C compatible target.\n",
    "When the latest version of the modelled domestic pathways (MDPs) were produced in March 2024, they were harmonised to the latest historical data available at the time. Since then, Nigeria has revised their estimate of historical emissions, resulting in a gap in 2019 between the MDPs and historical data. This discrepancy will be addressed in the next update.\n",
    "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
    "In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria recommitted to unconditionally reducing emissions 20% below BAU by 2030. This is equivalent to an emissions level of 28-35% above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF) by 2030. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 unconditional target as 1.5°C compatible.\n",
    "The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s unconditional target is consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. Nigeria’s unconditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "The fair share literature for Nigeria is sparse and some equity categories have few data points. As a result, the upper bound of Nigeria’s fair share range is dominated by a handful of studies. This high range is not reflective of much of the literature, which indicates more stringent emission reductions. Future equity studies may help to improve the fair share analysis for Nigeria.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act that seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions, green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a target to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070 (Okereke & Onuigbo, 2021). The Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, published in 2023, sets a net zero target year of 2060 within the framework of the Act(National Climate Change Council, 2023a). The Act includes provisions to adopt National Climate Change Action Plans in five-year cycles that are meant to ensure national emissions are consistent with a carbon budget (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021). However, the government has not met the initial deadlines set in the Act.\n",
