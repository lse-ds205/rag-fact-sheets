        "\n## Overview\n",
        "**South Africa's new government is focusing on energy system stabilisation and security, pursuing expansion of both fossil and renewable energy supply. Amid an ongoing energy crisis, it is progressing with the legal adoption of sectoral carbon budgets and expanding the country’s renewable energy generation capacity. But, concurrently, the government continues to target growth in controversial fossil gas capacity and appears to be delaying its shift away from the country's heavy coal reliance as it props up the struggling state-owned electricity company Eskom.**\n",
        "**Uncertainty remains on the future of South Africa’s power sector due to a lack of a recent centralised public plan. The government has not yet published an updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) since releasing the now-outdated 2019 version. The coal plant decommissioning roadmap, indicated in the 2019 IRP, appears to have been delayed and new coal capacity was added to the grid in 2024. Overall, the CAT continues to rate South Africa’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”.**\n",
        "Recent government publications imply a continued reorientation towards a more market-based and decentralised energy system. Procurement auctions for additional wind and solar capacity were held in 2024 and tax incentives have been implemented to support the growing trend of households and businesses installing solar and batteries. The Presidential Climate Committee (PCC) recommended renewables and battery storage as least cost options, as well as the full phase-out of coal but left the potential role of gas an open question, indicating that more research would be required. Meanwhile, the government actively pursues new fossil gas capacity with a procurement round proceeding in 2024.\n",
        "South Africa continues to struggle with an unstable electricity system. Chronic undersupply of electricity and ongoing load shedding are persistently impacting the economy and the everyday lives of South Africans. In attempts to resolve the crisis, the government is beginning to implement significant structural reforms. Greater participation of privately owned utility-scale generation and small-scale distributed generation is being pursued.\n",
        "Government efforts to reform Eskom, South Africa’s public electricity utility, are also ongoing. Debt relief for Eskom, equivalent to over half of the company’s debt over three years, commenced in 2023 to enable investment and maintenance of the power system. The unbundling of Eskom’s transmission and distribution functions is also progressing with the passing of the Electricity Regulation Amendment Act in 2024, paving the way to establishing an independent state-owned transmission system operator.\n",
        "South Africa has advanced several positive climate policies and measures:\n",
        "- **Adoption of the Climate Change Act**: in July 2024, South Africa’s President Ramaphosa signed the Climate Change Bill into law. The Climate Change Act represents a significant strengthening of climate governance for South Africa. Under the legislation, the government must set sectoral emission targets for each GHG emitting sector in line with the national emission target every five years. Carbon budgets will also be allocated to large-scale GHG emitting companies, intended to place a cap on emissions and make it mandatory for companies to constrain their emissions.",
        "- **Expanded funder base in the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P):** at COP26 in 2021, South Africa, France, Germany, UK, the US and the EU made a political declaration to establish a long-term partnership to support South Africa’s pathway to low-emissions and climate resilient development. Since the announcement of the partnership, additional international donors, (including the World Bank, the African Development Bank and CIF), increased the available funding from USD 8.5bn to USD 13.8bn. In early 2025, the USA unfortunately left the partnership. However, its withdrawal of less than 10% of the funding still leaves USD 12.8bn of committed funding from other partners, and South Africa is actively seeking additional partnerships.",
        "- **Development of the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan (JET-IP):** South Africa presented the JET-IP in November 2022, which details financing needs of USD 98bn over the next five years for catalysing a sustained just energy transition. The JET-IP outlines how best to direct the initial offer of USD 8.5bn from donor countries to priority investment areas. The initial funds will mostly go to the power sector, supporting a just transition away from coal, with additional investments in new energy vehicles, primarily battery electric vehicles, and green hydrogen. 2024 has been the first year of active implementation with USD 2bn reported expenditure as of early 2025.",
        "- **Accelerating renewable energy expansion:** the share of wind and solar in total electricity generation is growing, more than doubling between 2019 and 2023, from 4.5% of total generation in 2019 to 11.6% in 2023. Key policies supporting the uptake of renewables are the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) and the removal of licencing requirements for distributed generation projects of up to 100 MW in size. The government has also introduced tax rebates to incentivise installation of rooftop solar by commercial and residential customers. The most recent public auction rounds for renewable electricity and battery capacity were oversubscribed and South Africa imported record amounts of solar panels in 2023 and 2024.",
        "While there has been progress on procuring renewables and removing barriers to private participation, transitioning away from fossil fuels still faces challenges. To meet its ambitions for a just energy transition, South Africa could:\n",
        "- **Follow the guidance of the Presidential Climate Committee (PCC) and pursue a low-cost, renewables-based electricity system.** While PCC recommendations on the role of fossil gas remain unclear, all least-cost models reviewed by the PCC add no new coal or nuclear due to high costs and a transition to more affordable renewables with co-located storage.",
        "- **Accelerate the decommissioning of coal and set an ambitious phase out plan for coal power plants** incorporated into key national plans including the finalised JET IP and updated IRP. New coal capacity additions are neither cost-effective nor compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5ºC. Recent CAT analysis shows South Africa needs to cut its coal power reliance significantly by 2030 and phase it out by 2040. However, South Africa added 800 MW of new coal capacity in 2024 and plans additional capacity in 2025.",
        "- **Increase assistance to coal communities who are most affected by the coal phase-out** to ensure a smooth and just transition for affected groups, building capacity and necessary administrative infrastructure, and setting out clear and predictable plans.",
        "- **Prioritise urgent investments in transmission and distribution**. As specified in the JET IP, investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure is critical to ensure uptake of private sector-driven deployment of renewable energy. Grid infrastructure will need additional, external support in the form of concessional finance and budget assistance.",
        "- **Set ambitious sectoral budgets under the Climate Change Act and strengthen the carbon tax to ensure effective decarbonisation incentives.** Emissions exceeding the agreed carbon budget thresholds are intended to be penalised with a higher rate of carbon tax. It is thus imperative that the penalty for excess emissions is sufficiently high to avoid negating the impact of the sectoral carbon budgets.",
        "- **Develop targeted policy interventions for the transport, building and industry sectors.** These sectors are substantial emitters in South Africa but have not received sufficient policy attention to date. New sectoral targets under the Climate Change Act are an opportunity to enhance focus on these sectors. Recent analyses by the Climate Action Tracker indicate that the steel industry’s emissions intensity would need to be reduced by about 30% by 2030 and EV market share would need to increase to 50–95% by 2030 and 90–100% by 2040 to be compatible with the Paris Agreement. However, comprehensive public plans targeting emissions in these sectors are not available.",
        "The CAT rates South Africa’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
        "South Africa is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. South Africa’s NDC and policies and action are both rated as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. South Africa’s NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” considering against modelled domestic pathways. As a country with lower responsibility, capability, and per-capita emissions, South Africa should receive international support to set an ambitious conditional NDC target beyond its national fair share and implement the policies necessary to achieve it.\n",
        "The updated 2030 emissions reduction target submitted to the UNFCCC in September 2021 follows the Presidential Climate Commission recommending 350-420 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF).\n",
        "South Africa’s 2030 NDC target has a range, of which we rate the upper end, because reaching that would comply with the NDC.\n",
        "To get a better rating South Africa needs to increase its climate target’s ambition and implement associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend. We rate South Africa’s current policies and actions as “Insufficient”. This rating indicates that South Africa’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
        "Under current policies, South Africa will not reduce emissions enough to meet its NDC target range for 2030.\n",
        "South Africa’s recent progress on policies and actions is mixed. Commendable progress has occurred with the passing of the Climate Change Bill in July 2024. The country now needs to set sectoral carbon budgets, including for certain companies. A second phase of the carbon tax will soon commence, with a proposal out for comment. Given the intended role of the carbon tax to penalise emissions which exceed the future carbon budgets, a sufficiently stringent rate takes on new importance.\n",
        "Expansion of renewable energy supply continues in South Africa with new rounds of renewable energy procurement auctions held, most recently in summer 2024. Licencing barriers to small scale solar PV installations have been removed and tax incentives are in place for households and businesses to install their own solar PV. These measures have been followed by record imports of solar panels and batteries into the country in 2023 and 2024.\n",
        "Yet, uncertainty over the prioritisation of decarbonisation of the power sector persists. Coal plant decommissioning appears to have been delayed and Eskom added new coal generation to the grid in 2024. The government is also pursuing an expansion of fossil gas generation with an open auction round for new capacity as of end-2024.\n",
        "If considering South Africa’s planned but not yet implemented policies, our rating of policies and actions would go up to “1.5°C compatible”. The stringent implementation of proposed economy-wide and sector-specific policy measures would enable South Africa to achieve at least the top end of its NDC range, falling within the current range.\n",
        "It should be noted that CAT policy projections for South Africa rely on outdated energy system planning documents from the South African government. Future updates will incorporate more up to date national energy system scenarios as they become available. Please refer to the assumptions section for further information.\n",
        "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
        "We rate the updated 2030 reduction target levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s NDC in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.\n",
        "The CAT rates South Africa’s reduction target based on the upper range of its target, which falls in the “Almost sufficient” range, even if close to the limit to “1.5°C compatible”. If South Africa were to meet the lower end of the range it would be 1.5°C compatible when compared to modelled emissions pathways; however, it would still fall short of its fair-share contribution.\n",
        "South Africa currently relies on foreign investments and international finance support to implement a large percentage of its climate change programmes, and the government also emphasises in its updated NDC that the implementation of its NDC will be enabled by financial support as specified in the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "We rate South Africa’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
        "CAT interprets the full NDC target as unconditional. As South Africa only needs to reach the upper end of the target range to fulfil the NDC, we rate that emissions level. If South Africa committed to meeting the lower end of its target range, the rating would change to “Almost sufficient” when compared to the fair share contribution.\n",
        "The CAT currently does not evaluate South Africa’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. We will do so once further information is communicated by the government.\n"

If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
        "Under these current policies, South Africa will not achieve the necessary emissions reductions needed to meet its NDC target range for 2030. If considering South Africa’s planned - but not yet implemented - policies, our rating of policies and actions would improve to “1.5°C compatible”. The stringent implementation of proposed economy-wide and sector-specific policy measures would also enable South Africa to achieve at least the top end of its NDC range.\n",
        "\n## Policy overview\n",
        "South Africa is undergoing a period of political change. In May 2024, the country voted to remove the African National Congress (ANC) from majority rule for the first time since the end of apartheid rule in 1994. A coalition government subsequently formed between the ANC, the Democratic Alliance party and smaller parties. The new government assumes power in difficult circumstances (BBC News, 2024). In late 2024, South Africa’s unemployment rate was estimated to be 32% and structural issues with the country's infrastructure continue to present major obstacles for economic development and the energy transition (FRED Economic data, 2024; Rose, 2024). Interest paid on debt also continues to rise as a share of government spending, reaching 15% of total public expenditure in 2023 (Department of Statistics, 2024). Despite these challenges, South Africa continues to pursue GHG reduction and has meaningfully progressed several energy transition policies in 2024.\n",
        "Using the latest available emissions data, the CAT estimates a decline of close to 3% in emissions between 2021 and 2022. This reverses the growth observed between 2020 and 2021 and means South Africa’s latest post-COVID emissions total is almost 9% lower than the pre-pandemic 2019 total figure.\n",
        "The CAT estimates South Africa’s emissions under current policies are on track to reach 445–481 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030, equivalent to 10–17% below 2010 levels excluding LULUCF. Under these current policy projections, South Africa’s emission levels in 2030 will be above the upper bound of the updated NDC target range for the same year (around 8–44 MtCO2e higher).\n",
        "The range of our latest projections have decreased compared to our previous projection from October 2023. This is due to a downward revision of historical data using more recent government reported inventory data for 2007 to 2020 and updated estimates of 2022 from PRIMAP as explained in the Assumptions section (DFFE, 2023; Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023b).\n",
        "We further estimate that emission levels could decrease to as low as 395 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030 if South Africa were to implement its planned policies, including the expansion plans for the renewable electricity procurement, the accelerated switch to low-carbon mode of transport, energy efficiency measures, and a strengthened carbon tax. Under these planned policies projections, South Africa would fall under the upper bound of its 2030 NDC target range. These findings emphasise the emissions reduction potential of a stringent implementation of proposed economy-wide and sector-specific policy measures.\n",
        "Most of South Africa’s active GHG mitigation policies target the power sector, which is the single largest source of emissions in the country, accounting for over 40% of total emissions in 2022 (South African Government, 2024b). Significant changes are occurring in the sector. The government is attempting to shift the sector in a more market-oriented direction and is targeting increased generation capacity across fossil and renewable sources.\n",
        "\n### Cross-sectoral policies\n",
        "The key cross-sectoral polices in South Africa are the recently adopted Climate Change Act and a carbon tax, enacted in 2019. In addition, South Africa is implementing a Just Energy Transition Partnership Investment Plan with the support of several developed countries and private donors.\n",
        "In July 2024, South Africa’s President Ramaphosa signed the Climate Change Bill into law (South African Government, 2024c). The Climate Change Act represents a significant step forward for South Africa’s governance of climate change mitigation. Under the legislation, the Minister responsible for Environmental Affairs together with the Ministerial Committee on Climate Change must set sectoral emission targets for each GHG emitting sector in line with the national emission target every five years.\n",
        "Carbon budgets will also be allocated to significant GHG emitting companies to place a cap on emissions and make it mandatory for companies to constrain their emissions. Furthermore, the law requires the responsible persons to implement relevant policies and measures, monitor their effectiveness and report on progress annually to the South African Presidency. The mitigation plans must be made public, inviting scrutiny from third parties. While the Climate Change Act strengthens governance of South Africa’s GHG mitigation efforts, it has been criticized for failing to prescribe penalties for excess sectoral or company emissions. Instead, the government intends to amend the Climate Tax Act so that companies which exceed their carbon budgets will pay a higher rate of carbon tax on excess emissions, effectively allowing emitters to “pay to pollute” (Centre for Environmental Rights, 2023). The effectiveness of the legislation will thus rely on the excess emissions fee being sufficiently penalising to incentivise mitigation efforts.\n",
        "The importance of South Africa’s carbon tax, adopted in February 2019, is strengthened through this interlinkage with the Climate Change Act. The carbon tax in its present form covers fossil fuel combustion emissions, industrial processes and product use emissions, and fugitive emissions such as those from coal mining (Climate Home News, 2019; Reuters, 2019). The carbon tax rates were last adjusted in 2022 and as of 2025 are applied at a headline rate of R 236/tCO2e (approximately USD 12.50/tCO2e). The government further plans to reach a carbon price of USD 30/tCO2e by 2030 and USD 120/tCO2e by 2050 (National Treasury, 2024). The current structure of the tax allows for substantial reductions in the headline rate due to tax free allocations of 60 to 95% of total GHG emissions of affected firms and the use of carbon offsets to reduce the tax bill. Previous analysis found that the carbon tax does not effectively contribute to emission reductions given the low levy, generous basic allowance and other available exemptions (Szabo, 2021).\n",
        "South Africa is currently in the process of designing a more stringent second phase of the carbon tax. The South African Treasury published proposed changes to the carbon tax rules in November 2024 with the consultation closing in December 2024. The proposed changes include reducing the tax-free allowance by 10 percentage points in 2026, from 60% to 50% of emissions, and a further 10 percentage points reduction phased in over the 2027 to 2030 period. The allowed use of carbon offsets to reduce the tax bill will simultaneously increase to from 5% of total emissions in 2025 to 20% of total emissions in 2026 and remain at 20% to 2030. Combined, these changes will lead to an estimated effective tax rate of just 69–116 R/tCO2e by 2030 (around 3.7–6.2 USD/tCO2e) (National Treasury, 2024). Thus, the proposals for the second phase of the carbon tax retain generous reductions in headline tax exposure. The carbon tax is therefore unlikely to significantly increase incentives for emission reductions. The South African government has proposed a higher rate of 640 R/tCO2e for emissions exceeding allocated carbon budgets under the Climate Change Act. While this would represent a significant strengthening of incentives, the rate which will be applied to excess emissions and how it will interact with reductions is yet to be finalised. A sufficiently stringent rate is necessary to avoid negating the effectiveness of the Climate Change Act.\n",
        "\n### Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)\n",
        "At COP26, South Africa, France, Germany, UK, USA and the EU made a political declaration to establish a long-term partnership to support South Africa’s pathway to low-emissions and climate resilient development.\n",
        "The partners resolved to mobilise an initial USD 8.5bn in grants, concessional loans, guarantees, private investments, and technical support in the first five-year period between 2023-2027 to accelerate the decarbonisation of South Africa’s electricity system to achieve the most ambitious NDC target, support a just transition that protects vulnerable workers and communities, and support green industrialisation, including green hydrogen and low-carbon transport technologies (Farand, 2021; Government of South Africa, 2021d).\n",
        "The South African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) builds on a country-led, donor-supported process by the South African government, putting a distinct focus on a just transition, including retraining and supporting coal workers. Since the announcement of the partnership, additional international donors, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank and CIF, have increased the available funding from USD 8.5bn to USD 13.8bn. Of the pledged funds, 7% is in the form of grants, with the remaining funds allocated by way of concessional loans and commercial investments (CIF, 2025; World Bank, 2023). Unfortunately, in early 2025, the USA decided to withdraw from the partnership and rescind its committed funding. However, the withdrawal of the USA still leaves South Africa with USD 12.8bn in funding and the government is actively seeking new partnerships (South African Government, 2025b).\n",
        "Meanwhile, implementation of JET-P projects has commenced. The South African government published an implementation plan in November 2023, with 2024 being the first year of active implementation (South African Government, 2024f). The Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan (JET-IP) outlines the allocation of funds across six portfolios: Electricity, Mpumalanga Just Transition, Municipalities, New energy vehicles, Green Hydrogen, and Skills. The cross-sectoral investment plan notes that the three priority areas of focus are electricity, new energy vehicles and green hydrogen. The bulk of the funds are intended to be allocated to the electricity sector, with 48% of total identified funding requirements planned for this sector. The implementation plan identifies total funding requirements of USD 98bn for full implementation of the plan (South African Government, 2023c). Substantial additional funds must therefore be leveraged from public and private sector sources to implement all planned projects by 2028.\n",
        "Despite South Africa’s energy crisis and change in government, implementation progress on the JET-IP has progressed. The government publishes data on the grant funded projects of the JET-IP and, as of Q3 2024, just under USD 388mn has reached implementation stage projects (South African Government, 2025a). Granular data on the non-grant forms of finance in the partnership is not readily available but the European Commission reported that USD 2bn had been spent on the JET-IP as of early 2025 (European Commission, 2025). Overall, the evolution of the JET-P process in South Africa reflects the challenging nature of sustaining partnerships between varied countries and implementing long-term plans without the certainty of commitment from key partners. The success of South Africa’s implementation will hinge on sufficient funding from diverse sources remaining available through the implementation period, so that South Africa can sustain the internal resources needed to drive delivery.\n",
        "\n## Power sector\n",
        "South Africa’s coal-dominated power sector is a major contributor to the nation’s emissions, accounting for over 40% of total GHG emissions in 2022 (South African Government, 2024b). Coal accounted for 82% of the country’s power mix, followed by renewables (13%), nuclear (3%), and oil (1%) (Ember, 2025).\n",
        "Total generating capacity in the country has been growing steadily and passed 62 GW in 2023, 8% larger than 2019’s installed capacity of just over 57 GW. Coal remains by far the largest source of power at almost 46 GW in 2023, at close to 74% of total generation capacity. Wind and solar capacity has been growing in South Africa in recent years, with utility-scale wind and solar capacity estimated to have grown by more than 30% since 2019, reaching 9.6 GW in 2023. Wind and solar have also increased as a share of total generation in South Africa in the past five years, from 4.5% in 2019 to 11.6% in 2023 (Ember, 2025).\n",
        "This increase has occurred while overall electricity generation levels have been falling in South Africa. Total utility-scale electricity generated in 2023 was over 7% lower than the pre-Covid figure in 2019. This fall in demand largely reflects the energy crisis which the country has been enduring as opposed to efficiency gains.\n",
        "**South Africa’s ongoing energy crisis and policy response**\n",
        "South Africa’s power sector faces a severe undersupply of generation, exacerbated by its aging coal fleet, substantial under-investment in grid infrastructure and corruption. For over 15 years, Eskom, South Africa’s public utility, has continually resorted to power cuts lasting multiple hours to avoid damage to the grid (Ferragamo, 2023). Equipment breakdowns, maintenance, and repairs negatively affected the operation of multiple coal units in the country’s aging fleet throughout 2023 (Francke, 2023).\n",
        "The government declared a national state of disaster in early 2023 as load-shedding intensified to make 2023 the worst year on record for power outages (BusinessTech, 2024). Persistent power cuts have significant consequences for people’s lives and livelihoods. A South African Reserve Bank study found the load-shedding in 2022 likely impacted GDP growth by -0.7 to -3.2% (Janse van Rensburg & Morema, 2023). In 2024, the situation improved, with Eskom reporting 300 consecutive days without load shedding. This hopefully signifies a lasting turning point for South Africa (Eskom, 2025).\n",
        "The heavily indebted public utility Eskom has received a series of government funded bailouts but has so far been unable to fully stabilise the electricity system. In February 2023, the government provided Eskom with debt relief equivalent to over half of the company’s debt to enable investment and maintenance of the power system (Mukherjee, 2023a; National Treasury, 2023). A condition of the debt relief was a moratorium on new borrowing. Given Eskom’s position as the largest owner of generation assets in South Africa, this restriction has considerable implications for the country’s renewables build-out, with the role of private sector actors increasing in importance.\n",
        "In seeking to address the ongoing crisis in the electricity system, South Africa is undertaking major structural reforms of its electricity market. These include the unbundling of Eskom’s transmission, distribution and generation functions into separate companies, increasing third-party generation, as well as exploring private sector involvement in the buildout and ownership of transmission infrastructure.\n",
        "In 2024, the South African government passed the Electricity Regulation Amendment Act to establish an independent state-owned transmission network and operator, a role previously held by Eskom alongside its role as electricity generator (South African Government, 2024e). The new Transmission System Operator (TSO) must be established within five years in order to strengthen and develop electricity infrastructure and to establish a competitive market with multiple buyers and sellers, moving towards a decentralised system with greater private sector ownership of energy assets (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2024d; Eskom, 2024a). Some regulatory decisions are already being contested, indicating the challenging nature of structural reforms and redistribution of influence in South Africa’s power sector (Times, 2024). But an effective evolution of South Africa’s electricity market structure is crucial to facilitate greater integration of renewables.\n",
        "In addition to structural reforms, South Africa has introduced policies focusing on increasing levels of fossil and renewable power generation. Key policies and plans impacting the different energy sources are outlined below.\n",
        "South Africa government is sending **“Mixed signals”** on coal. While the overall share of coal in the power sector has slowly declined in the last five years, the plant decommissioning roadmap appears to have been delayed, and new coal capacity was recently added to the grid.\n",
        "The government outlines its plans for the power sector in iterative publications of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The most recent draft 2023 IRP was published for comment in 2024 but the finalised report has yet to be made public, as of January 2025.\n",
        "In contrast to the 2019 IRP, which called for decommissioning 12 GW of older coal capacity by 2030, the draft 2023 IRP strengthens focus on energy security and seeks to maintain existing coal capacity. In modelling the near-term outlook to 2030, the report recommends delaying coal plant decommissioning and continuing operation of plants beyond their scheduled lifetime if feasible. Actual decommissioning of coal plants does appear to have been delayed, indicating a change of priorities towards electricity stabilisation and energy security. According to the Global Energy Monitor, less than 1.2 GW have been retired as of October 2024 (Cunliffe, 2023; Global Energy Monitor, 2024).\n",
        "In its pursuit of stabilising the electricity system, South Africa continues to add new coal plants to the grid, with Eskom connecting 800 MW of new coal capacity in June 2024 and nearing completion of a further 800 MW coal capacity in early 2025 (Eskom, 2024b; Green Building Africa, 2024). The nation is undoubtedly navigating a challenging period in its energy transition. Nonetheless, recent analysis suggests that these planned coal power plants will be significantly more expensive than their low-carbon alternatives (Ireland & Burton, 2018; Paton, 2018; PCC, 2023). In the context of extending reliance on coal, the South African energy minister signalled in July 2024 that the country is unlikely to meet its 2030 NDC targets (Reuters, 2024).\n",
        "Despite the reversal in plans to decommission coal plants, it should be noted that the share of coal in generation in South Africa has been falling in recent years, from just over 89% in 2019 to less than 82% in 2024 (Ember, 2025). If a merit order dispatch system is created in the South African electricity market, as the government appears to have signalled in the Electricity Regulation Amendment Act, coal will become increasingly uncompetitive in scenarios with sufficient renewable generation and flexibility in the system. This will naturally occur if renewables are allowed to compete freely for dispatch, given the near-zero marginal operating cost of wind and solar generation. An ambitious application of the upcoming carbon budget system and enhanced carbon tax penalties will amplify these trends, highlighting the risk of stranded assets with further expansion of the coal fleet in South Africa.\n",
        "South Africa is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on fossil gas. Although there is currently no gas-fired power generation, the government intends to significantly expand its fossil gas capacity, as outlined in its draft 2023 IRP.\n",
        "In a further reversal of policy intention from the 2019 IRP, the modelling results presented in the draft 2023 IRP suggest fossil gas capacity would reach close to 11 GW in 2030 instead of the previously planned 7 GW. The draft 2023 IRP also discusses potential means of increasing fossil gas supply for South Africa, signalling a lack of ambition to transition from coal directly to renewables with a phase-out of all fossil fuels.\n",
        "South Africa has begun implementing stated plans to increase fossil gas capacity, although progress is slow. In December 2023, the government issued a request for proposal for 2 GW of fossil gas power plant capacity. The bid window has since been extended to March 2025 following issues with the initial process, meaning additional gas capacity is yet to enter construction stage, as of early 2025 (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2024a).\n",
        "South Africa is making **“Slow Progress”** on deploying renewables. Despite commendable progress in recent years in challenging circumstances, the country’s grid remains dominated by fossil fuels. The approved 2019 Integrated Resource Plan targeted 27.6 GW of renewables to be installed by 2030, excluding large hydro. At just under 10 GW of installed renewable capacity as of 2023, South Africa’s renewable expansion plans are off-track (Cunliffe, 2023). Furthermore, the draft 2023 IRP lowered the expected installed capacity of wind and solar by 2030. Nonetheless, wind and solar capacity and generation has been ramping up in South Africa in recent years, rising from 4.5% of total generation in 2019 to 11.6% in 2023 (Ember, 2025). South Africa will need international support to ensure that current ambition levels are retained and increased further to maximise the country’s potential for renewable electricity generation.\n",
        "As such, it is imperative that current ambition levels are retained and increased further to maximise the potential for renewable electricity generation in South Africa.\n",
        "Key policies supporting this trend are the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) and the removal of licencing requirements for distributed generation projects up to 100 MW in size. The government has also introduced generous tax rebates to incentivise installation of rooftop solar by commercial and residential customers.\n",
        "The REIPPPP is presently South Africa’s core method of procuring new renewable capacity. It is a competitive tendering process that invites bids from private operators to develop grid-scale renewable energy capacity. Winning bids are awarded a power purchase agreement, with Eskom typically providing the offtake agreement. Launched in 2011, the REIPPPP successfully galvanised over USD 16bn in successive bid windows in its first 5 years (NDC Partnership, 2016). Most recently, bid window 7 closed in 2024 with the goal of procuring an additional 5 GW of wind and solar capacity. In December 2024 preferred bids of close to 2.5 GW in new wind and solar capacity were announced and additional winning bids may also be procured (Department of Electricity and Energy, 2024; South African Government, 2024a).\n",
        "The REIPPPP has been very successful in generating interest in renewable energy project development, with all bidding rounds significantly over-subscribed. However, considerable delays in bid rounds and in connecting the procured renewable projects to the grid have arisen. Many South African projects have stalled due to the elevated interest rates and supply chain challenges of recent years (Mukherjee, 2023b).\n",
        "The second important policy support for renewable expansion is the removal of licencing requirements for distributed projects. In 2021, the government increased the threshold for licencing requirements from 1 MW to 100 MW projects, followed by complete removal of thresholds in December 2022. According to the draft 2023 IRP, these changes have resulted in the registration of an additional 6 GW of distributed generation, but it is not clear what share of this new capacity is renewable (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2024b, 2024c).\n",
        "Finally, in 2023, the government announced a generous tax rebate scheme to incentivise renewables installation by South African companies. Until 2025, the scheme enables businesses to claim 125% of the cost of installation of renewable generation projects against their tax bill in the year of installation. Another tax incentive has been introduced for households to recover 25% of the costs of installation (South African Government, 2023b).\n",
        "Given South Africa’s ongoing challenges with transmission infrastructure, off-grid distributed renewables are a promising avenue to stabilise supply and decarbonise electricity in the country, although it is a solution available to higher income households and businesses only.\n",
        "Overall, these policy trends present a positive outlook for renewables expansion in South Africa in the near term.\n",
        "\n## Industry\n",
        "South Africa is host to significant heavy industry with large scale steel and ferroalloy production, along with chemical and cement manufacturing and other industrial activities. These activities account for a substantial share of national emissions, according to South Africa’s most recent UNFCCC National Inventory Report. The government estimates that non-energy emissions in the IPPU sector fell by close to 7% between 2000 and 2022, largely driven by falling demand for industrial goods rather than by policy (South African Government, 2024b, p. 40).\n",
        "The carbon tax is one of the few mechanisms to directly target industrial emissions, but it has permitted generous tax-free allowances and other deductions to date and has thus not served as a strong incentive to decarbonise industrial operations. It remains to be seen how the tax may be strengthened with the introduction of sectoral carbon budgets as part of the Climate Change Act. The current proposals from the South African Treasury suggest the continuation of generous offsets for the industry sector (National Treasury, 2024).\n",
        "Policy and planning documents for the South African industry sector generally address sustainable industrial economic development but feature little mention of mitigation targets for the industry sector, nor concrete measures for implementation. The post-2015 draft National Energy Efficiency Strategy proposed industrial sector targets for energy efficiency by 2030 (Department of Energy, 2016). However, as of 2025, there is no follow-up publication detailing implementation.\n",
        "Further implemented policy measures which target improved energy efficiency in the South African industry include the National Cleaner Production Centre South Africa, a network and information provision programme that promotes energy efficiency measures; its associated Industrial Energy Efficiency Project (IEEP), implemented between 2011–2021, that promoted energy management systems and international best practice energy management standards; the 12L tax incentive which allows businesses to write off verified energy savings from efficiency projects against tax due; and the Green Fund South Africa that financially supports green technology research and implementation. However, these measures may only induce small emissions reduction impacts.\n",
        "Beyond efforts to decarbonise and improve efficiency, South Africa is also aiming to develop value chains for renewable energy and storage technologies through the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), released for public comment in July 2023 (The dtic, 2023). The plan particularly aims to take advantage of increasing domestic and international demand for these technologies to drive industrial development and create jobs as part of the just transition.\n",
        "There are limited signs of policy-driven emission reductions in the near future for emissions-intensive subsectors such as steel production and mining, though there has been some interest in hydrogen. The Hydrogen Society Roadmap (2021) and draft Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy (2020) highlight the potential role of hydrogen, and steps to develop green hydrogen for use in steel production, industrial mining, mineral beneficiation, manufacturing, logistics, and other sectors (DSI, 2021; The dtic, 2022). The South African Steel and Metal Fabrication Master Plan 1.0 (2021) mentions hydrogen, along other measures, in consideration of greening the industry (The dtic, 2021). For hydrogen to decarbonise the industry sector, it must be produced using renewable energy.\n",
        "Analysis by the Climate Action Tracker indicates that the steel industry’s emissions intensity would need to be reduced by about 30% in 2030 and by about 90%-100% by 2050 to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "\n## Transport\n",
        "South Africa’s 2024 National Inventory Report estimates that emissions from transport represented around 11% of total GHG emissions in 2022, excluding LULUCF. The overwhelming majority of transport emissions come from road transport (South African Government, 2024b). The South African government estimates that transport emissions have been steadily increasing, with an estimated increase of 27% in transport emissions since 2000.\n",
        "In 2018 the Department of Transport published the first Green Transport Strategy (GTS) 2018–2050 (Department of Transport South Africa, 2018), proposing a list of measures encompassing public transit development, electric and alternative fuelled vehicles that should be implemented to transition the sector to a low carbon future. The Biennial Transparency Report, published in December 2024, highlights three measures as the most impactful transport focused policies. These are the Bus Rapid Transport System project, which aims to develop bus networks in South Africa’s major cities; the Transnet Road to Rail Programme, which aims to shift freight transport from trucks to more carbon efficient rail; and projects within the Just Energy Transition partnership which focus on Electric Vehicles (EVs), primarily the development of EV manufacturing. In addition to these policies, South Africa has also mandated the blending of biofuels into petrol and diesel supplies, although currently at very low levels (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2020b; IEA, 2024).\n",
        "Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRT) have initiated the main switch in modal share of passenger transport in urban areas. Initiatives to expand BRT systems are currently taking place in eight cities and municipalities including Cape Town and Johannesburg. However, BRT still faces challenges such as competition with minibus taxis and overreliance on foreign service plans less suitable for South African cities (Hook & Weinstock, 2021).\n",
        "South Africa has a large car manufacturing sector, and the government is targeting increased domestic EV production (Department of Trade Industry and Competition, 2021). The automotive industry is one of the country’s largest manufacturing and highest value-added sectors, contributing to over 4% of GDP in 2021 (NAAMSA, 2023). In 2013, the government adopted South Africa’s Electric Vehicle Industry Roadmap to introduce electric passenger vehicles (EVs) (South African Government, 2013).\n",
        "Three years after the adoption of the roadmap, the first EV was manufactured in South Africa with the production of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) at Mercedes-Benz’s East London plant (Venter, 2023). Since then, Toyota has also begun manufacturing PHEVs and Ford also announced it will manufacture PHEVs in South Africa (Agbetiloye, 2023; Venter, 2021). While this shows some progress, the industry is still dominated by fossil fuel-vehicles, creating an existential challenge for the auto industry as South Africa’s main export destinations, such as the UK and EU, shift towards EVs (NAAMSA, 2023). In 2025, the government has taken further action to incentivise domestic EV production, introducing a tax deduction worth 150% of the costs of new or improved buildings and machinery for EV manufacture. The tax incentive will apply between 2026 and 2036 (Green Building Africa, 2025; South African Government, 2024d).\n",
        "On the demand-side, the total number of EVs vehicles sold in South Africa remains marginal. The number of battery EVs sold has been rising in South Africa, but the share in total sales remains low representing just 0.24% of new vehicle sales in 2024 (Kuhudzai, 2025).\n",
        "Analysis by the Climate Action Tracker shows that the electric vehicle share in annual vehicle sales in South Africa would need to increase to 50–95% by 2030 and 90–100% by 2040 to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "\n## Buildings\n",
        "South Africa’s commercial and residential buildings have undergone a major fuel switching process over the past two decades. In both building categories, onsite fuel consumption has fallen dramatically while the use and proportional share of electricity in building energy consumption has been steadily rising (South African Government, 2024b, pp. 80–82). Nonetheless, direct and indirect building emissions per capita in South Africa have been increasing in recent years (Climate Transparency, 2022).\n",
        "The move away from biomass and coal use for cooking and heating towards the use of more modern appliances that require electricity, which is largely generated by fossil fuels, might significantly increase indirect emissions without a rapid shift to renewables in the power sector. However, the health and welfare benefits resulting from these fuel switching developments are likely to be significant. The increasing electrification of buildings provides a clear pathway to decarbonising the sector via decarbonisation of electricity generation.\n",
        "Analysis by the Climate Action Tracker suggests that the buildings emissions intensity would need to decline by 50% for residential buildings by 2030 below 2015 values, 90% by 2040, and 100% by 2050 to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "South Africa has implemented several policies targeting improved energy efficiency and renewable energy use in buildings. In addition to the tax incentives for solar panel installations introduced in 2023 and 2024, active policies include the 12L Tax Incentive for businesses implementing energy efficiency measures, including building measures; public funding for upgrading of municipal buildings; and minimum energy performance standards and labelling requirements for appliances.\n",
        "In the National Development Plan 2030, the government has also stated an intention to develop zero-emission building standards by 2030 (South African Government, 2012). This would represent a strengthening of the existing standards and codes that South Africa has applied to energy efficiency and usage in new buildings and for major refurbishments of old buildings (Sustainable Energy Africa, 2017).\n",
        "Relatedly, the government released a regulation for mandatory energy performance certificates in 2020 (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2020a). The regulation applies to four different classes of larger-scale buildings and building owners were required to be compliant by the end of 2022 (Smith, 2021). The compliance date was subsequently extended to the end of 2025 (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2025).\n",
        "The draft Post-2015 National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which has not been finalised as of 2025, targets reductions of the final energy consumption by 33% in the residential sector and 37% in the public and commercial sector by 2030, compared to a 2015 baseline (Department of Energy, 2016). Information on implementation and tracking of the targets from the Energy Efficiency Strategy, however, does not appear to be available. The upcoming sectoral budgets in the Climate Change Act should result in specific emissions reduction targets for the buildings sector, if implemented rigorously.\n",
        "\n## Agriculture\n",
        "In 2022, agriculture accounted for just over 10% of South Africa’s emissions, with the majority coming from livestock. Emissions from agriculture have remained relatively constant since 2000 (South African Government, 2024b).\n",
        "A limited number of policies in South Africa’s agricultural and forestry sector target climate change mitigation. The 2024 Biennial Transparency Report lists the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme as the core policy targeting agriculture. This programme provides technical advice and financial support to farmers and includes increasing sustainable farming practices among its objectives. However, further details of its links to decarbonisation of the sector are not readily available.\n",
        "The National Climate Change Response Strategy, a climate strategy published in 2011, names climate smart agriculture (CSA) as a practice “that lowers agricultural emissions, is more resilient to climate changes, and boosts agricultural production” (Government of South Africa, 2011). A number of CSA activities are already in place in South Africa (Nciizah & Wakindiki, 2015), but their expected or actual mitigation impacts are not reported.\n",
        "In 2018, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, now the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment published two draft agricultural policies for public comment: the draft Conservation Agriculture Policy and the draft Climate Smart Agriculture Strategic Framework (DAFF, 2018a, 2018b).In 2020, a set of guidelines for implementing the practice were published by the department but no legally binding requirements or other policy incentives appear to have been introduced (South African Government, 2020a).\n",
        "\n## Forestry\n",
        "Forestry and other land use (FOLU) in South Africa is a net sink of emissions, meaning more carbon is sequestered than emitted. This net sink has overall been increasing since 2008, reaching over 25 MtCO2e in 2020 (DFFE, 2023). According to the 2024 Biennial Transparency Report, the LULUCF sector overall provided a sink of more than 40 MtCO2e in 2022.\n",
        "A number of mitigation related policy measures in South Africa’s forestry and other land use sector are in operation. The 1st Biennial Transparency Report lists ongoing work programmes on afforestation, forest and woodland restoration and rehabilitation, grassland rehabilitation and thicket restoration. It notes that the National Forests Amendment Act of 2022 aims to promote sustainability in the sector (South African Government, 2022a).\n",
        "Given the importance of the timber industry, the area of woody crops increased by over 50% since the early 1990s and stabilised over the 2010s (FAOSTAT, 2023). South Africa’s latest national inventory report indicates overall forest land has increased over the same period, however, other sources indicate the tree cover has continuously decreased (DFFE, 2023; FAOSTAT, 2023). It is unclear whether methodological differences or varying definitions are the reason for this apparent mismatch.\n"

        "\n## Historical emissions\n",
        "For historical data, GHG inventory data submitted to the UNFCCC accessed via the UNFCCC data portal was used for 1990 and 1994 (UNFCCC, 2019) and the National GHG Inventory Report published by the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment in 2022 was used for 2000 to 2020 (DFFE, 2023), with linear interpolation between 1990–1994 and 1994–2000. We used multiple sources because no single source provides a full data set from 1990-2021.\n",
        "For the years 2021 and 2022, we use growth rates from PRIMAP historical emissions applied to the 8th National Inventory Report published by the South African government in 2023 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023b; South African Government, 2023a). This inventory report did not include report emissions for 2022. Since updating the policy projections with this data, the South African government has published a new inventory report with their Biennial Transparency Report in late 2024. As the differences are small with the interpolated 2022 estimates, this source is not yet incorporated into historical emissions or policy projections and will be incorporated future updates.\n",
        "It is important to highlight that the University of Cape Town’s technical emissions scenario analysis which informed the 2021 NDC update found significantly lower emission levels compared to the 2023 National GHG Inventory report. This was due to the use of different methodologies and data sources (Marquard et al., 2021). For 2017, for example, there is a 15 MtCO2e difference between both estimates. We currently rely on official estimates provided by the Government of South Africa as explained above.\n",
        "\n## NDC targets and other targets\n",
        "In its 2021 updated NDC, South Africa provides an absolute emissions level in the target range 350–420 MtCO2e including LULUCF for 2030 (South African Government, 2021). Assuming LULUCF remains at the average level over 2011–2020 (-17 MtCO2e), this NDC target range translates to emission levels in 2030 of between 367–437 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF\n",
        "It is unclear which GWP values have been used to calculate the target range of the updated NDC of 2021. The NDC states that its targets are based on the latest inventory report, which uses SAR values, and that the country would transition to using AR5 in 2024.\n",
        "In its first NDC of 2016, South Africa’s target range was calculated using AR4 values. As the lower bound of the target range for 2025 is 398 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF) in both the first NDC of 2016 and the updated NDC of 2021, we assume that South Africa has continued to use AR4 values for these figures, notwithstanding the values used in its inventory report. Furthermore, the comparison that “the upper end of the target range in 2025 has been reduced by 17%, and the upper end of the target range in 2030 has been reduced by 32%, and the lower range by 12%” (South African Government, 2021) points to comparing both target ranges in AR4.\n",
        "\n## Current policy projections\n",
        "The lower bound of the current policy projections is based on a combination of the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2020 for CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (IEA, 2020) and non-CO2 emissions from the US EPA (US EPA, 2019). For other CO2 emissions (fugitive CO2 emissions and process emissions), we used historical data from the National GHG Inventory Report extended to 2021 with growth rates from PRIMAP and assume a direct correlation to emissions from coal-fired power plants afterwards (DFFE, 2023; Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023a).\n",
        "The WEO2020 Stated Policies Scenario for CO2 emissions from fuel combustion assumes full implementation of the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan with COVID-19 delay. The 2019 Integrated Resource Plan is outdated as of early 2025 and actual power plant capacities have diverged from the expected roadmap. However, the government has not presented a finalised updated national energy plan as the time of this analysis. For this reason, the analysis continues to use the WEO2020 Stated Policies Scenario.\n",
        "For non-CO2 emissions, we applied the growth rate from (US EPA, 2019) projections until 2030 to historical emissions. For CO2 process emissions and fugitive CO2 emissions, historical emissions data from PRIMAP (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023a) was used to check the correlation to emissions from coal-fired power plants. For projections, CAT assumes that this correlation will continue, meaning that we assume CO2 process emissions to develop with the same trend as the CO2 emissions from coal fired power plants in our current policy projections.\n",
        "The upper bound of the current policy projections is based on the ‘existing policies scenario with reference growth rate’ by the University of Cape Town’s technical emissions scenario analysis to inform the 2021 NDC update (Marquard et al., 2021). The ‘existing policy scenario’ assumes the full implementation of the IRP2019, a new world-scale crude refinery coming online in 2028 in line with government procurements, other crude refining capacity and coal-to-liquids capacity available until 2050, and the forecasted modernisations introduced by the 1st and 2nd National Waste Management Strategies.\n",
        "We harmonise the scenario’s growth rates for total emissions excluding land use emissions to the latest historical datapoint of 2021. This harmonisation process results in significantly higher final estimates for 2030 than assumed by the University of Cape Town’s ‘existing policies scenario with reference growth rate’ (502MtCO2e compared to 479 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Note that the University uses GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR), while the CAT uses GWP values from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\n",
        "\n## Planned policy projections\n",
        "The planned policy projections is based on the ‘planned policies scenario with reference growth rate’ by the University of Cape Town’s technical emissions scenario analysis to inform the 2021 NDC update (Marquard et al., 2021). Beyond the measures included under the ‘existing policy scenario’ (see section above), the ‘planned policy scenario’ assumes the full implementation of recently announced IRP2019 expansion plans, the Green Transport Strategy, the draft post-2015 National Energy Efficiency Strategy, and the carbon tax.\n",
        "We harmonise the scenario’s growth rates for total emissions excluding land use emissions to the latest historical datapoint of 2021. This harmonisation process results in significantly higher final estimates for 2030 than assumed by the University of Cape Town’s ‘existing policies scenario with reference growth rate’ (404 MtCO2e compared to 383 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Note that the University uses GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR), while the CAT uses GWP values from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\n",
        "\n## Net-zero target\n",
        "The South African government provides no underlying assumptions on its 2050 net-zero CO2 target as part of a visionary statement in its LTS (South African Government, 2020b). For this reason, we assumed that CO2 emissions will decline at a linear rate between 2030 and 2050 to balance LULUCF sinks in 2050. We assume that non-CO2 emissions will decline at a linear rate between 2030 and 2080 in line with the IPCC SR1.5 pathways. This would result in estimated residual emissions of 80 MtCO2e in 2050.\n",
        "\n## Global Warming Potentials values\n",
        "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR). The ‘NDC targets’ section above outlines the uncertainties on GWP assumed for the updated NDC target range.\n"

    "Targets": {
      "content": [
        "\n## Target Overview\n",
        "In its updated 2021 NDC, South Africa commits to absolute emissions target levels in the range of 350–420 MtCO2e, including LULUCF, for 2030 (South African Government, 2021). Assuming LULUCF remains at the average level over 2011–2020 (-17 MtCO2e), this NDC target range translates to emission levels in 2030 of between 367–437 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, equivalent to 19-32% below 2010 levels excluding LULUCF.\n",
        "The CAT rates South Africa's target as \"Almost sufficient\" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and \"Insufficient\" when rated against the fair share contribution. South Africa does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the unconditional target against the two rating frameworks.\n",
        "The CAT rates South Africa’s reduction target based on the upper range of its target. If South Africa were to meet the lower end of the range it would be 1.5°C compatible when compared to modelled emissions pathways; however, it would still fall short of its fair-share contribution.\n",
        "The NDC document does not specifically mention whether the emissions range is an unconditional target, but the CAT interprets it as such. South Africa’s NDC assumes “that implementation and ambition will be enabled by finance and technology and capacity building support (South African Government, 2021), similar to the previous 2016 NDC. It also highlights that equality, economic and social development and poverty eradication are South Africa’s top priorities.\n",

        "\n## NDC updates\n",
        "South Africa submitted a stronger target on 27 September 2021.\n",
        "The updated NDC strengthened the country’s target range for 2030: the upper end is now 31% lower and the lower end 12% lower than in the previous, 2016, NDC.\n",
        "The government followed the recommendations of the South African Presidential Climate Commission from June 2021. The multi-stakeholder group established by President Ramaphosa provided advice on the country’s NDC update, proposing stronger 2030 targets, going beyond a first draft NDC published for public consultation in March 2021.\n",
        "While the updated 2021 NDC increased South Africa’s climate ambition towards 2030 and increased clarity, transparency and understanding, the target range is not yet fully aligned with the 1.5˚C temperature goal.\n",
        "The 2021 NDC no longer makes reference to a peak-plateau-decline (PPD) trajectory, which foresaw South Africa’s emissions plateauing for approximately a decade between 2025 and 2035 and then declining in absolute terms towards 2050 (South African Government, 2016).\n",
        "* Please refer to the ‘Assumptions’ section for more details on the CAT’s assumptions on GWP used by South Africa.** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share.\n",
        "**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**\n",
        "- **27.09.2021** – South Africa’s updated NDC increases its climate ambition and transparency, although not yet sufficient to be in line with Paris Agreement temperature goal",
        "- **16.07.2021** – South Africa's Presidential climate commission recommends stronger mitigation target range for updated NDC: close to 1.5°C compatible",
        "- **30.03.2021** – South Africa’s updated NDC draft increases its climate ambition and transparency, although very likely not yet sufficient to be in line Paris Agreement temperature goal",
        "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
        "NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
        "We rate the 2030 reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.\n",
        "The CAT rates South Africa’s reduction target based on the upper range of its target, which falls in the “Almost sufficient” range, even if close to the limit to “1.5°C compatible”. If South Africa were to meet the lower end of the range it would be 1.5°C compatible when compared to modelled emissions pathways; however, it would still fall short of its fair-share contribution.\n",
        "South Africa currently relies on foreign investments and international finance support to implement a large percentage of its climate change programmes, and the government also emphasises in its updated NDC that the implementation of its NDC will be enabled by financial support as specified in the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "NDC target against fair share\n",
        "We rate South Africa’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
        "CAT interprets the full NDC target as unconditional. As South Africa only needs to reach its upper end of the target range to fulfil the NDC, we rate that emissions level. If South Africa committed to meeting the lower end of its target range, the rating would change to “Almost sufficient” when compared to the fair share contribution.\n",
        "Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found here**.**\n",
        "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
        "The 2021 updated NDC no longer refers to a peak-plateau-decline (PPD) trajectory. The previous peak-plateau-decline (PPD) trajectory, outlined in South Africa’s South Africa’s Copenhagen Accord pledge, foresaw South Africa reducing GHG emissions to 212–428 MtCO2e by 2050 including LULUCF (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2018; South African Government, 2010).\n",
        "South Africa’s Long-Term Strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2020 still refers to this PPD trajectory as a benchmark “in the absence of an agreed quantitative articulation of the vision” (South African Government, 2020b).\n",
        "The CAT no longer considers the previous 2050 target range an official long-term target for South Africa given it is no longer mentioned in the 2021 updated NDC and merely used as a benchmark in its long-term strategy (LTS) of 2020, the Low Emission Development Strategy 2050.\n",
        "South Africa first stated its intention to commit to a net zero CO2 target (“net zero carbon emissions”) by 2050 as part of a visionary statement in its LTS (South African Government, 2020b). In this context, the National Planning Commission is in the process of developing a common vision for South Africa in 2050 and will subsequently update its Low-Emission Development Strategy. The Just Transition Framework, released by the Presidential Climate Commission in June 2022 and approved by the Cabinet in September 2022, refers to reaching “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050” (Presidential Climate Commission, 2022; South African Government, 2022b).\n",
        "Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate South Africa’s net zero target. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.\n"
