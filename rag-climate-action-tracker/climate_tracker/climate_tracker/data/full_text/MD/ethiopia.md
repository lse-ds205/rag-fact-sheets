# Summary


## Overview

**Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances.**

**In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC,** **but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated.**

**The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.**

Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements.

Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.

Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022). This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).

For further information on the targets Ethiopia has adopted, see the targets tab.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Ethiopia does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality.
- **Emissions coverage** – Ethiopia states its intention to become “carbon neutral” (FDRE, 2015). For this reason, the CAT currently assumes Ethiopia’s target currently only covers CO2 emissions. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia had not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC as of August 2022 and did not reference the carbon neutrality target in its 2021 updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from GGGI, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios (GGGI, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will achieve unconditional and conditional NDC targets if current policies are fully implemented, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are "Critically insufficient" when compared with what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways say should be occurring within its borders. This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the updated NDC’s business-as-usual scenario for which we do not know which policies it includes. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.


## Policy overview

Since the end of 2020, Ethiopia has been engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and has driven a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The conflict has led to the most severe starvation crisis in the world, with famine affecting an estimated 900,000 Ethiopians and 1.8 million on the brink (Council on Foreign Relations, 2022). The deal agrees to restore services to the Tigray region and allow unrestricted access for aid agencies (NPR, 2022)

Climate policy has advanced little since our last update, unsurprising given the current political climate. Prior to the outbreak of the war, Ethiopia had been making headway, working on updating its 2011 Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and long-term strategy. The status of the CRGE update is unclear, but the Ethiopian government has engaged in further work to progress the long-term strategy (GGGI, 2022).

The basis of Ethiopia’s mitigation policy is its Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, published in 2011 (FDRE, 2011). As the name suggests, the strategy aims to keep greenhouse gas emissions low and build climate resilience, while achieving middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia is currently reviewing progress and updating the CRGE strategy, which should take into consideration Ethiopia’s updated NDC.

In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The new plan aims to bring economic growth, expecting 10.2% annual growth, while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020b). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s so-called greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan further includes similar emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.

Under current policy projections, GHG emissions in Ethiopia are expected to be 213–240 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)). Emissions are higher than our last update. The increase is largely driven by an upward revision of historical emissions in 2016-2018 and the likely limited long-term impact of the pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have on emissions.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.


## Energy supply

Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.

Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power.

**Hydropower**

For the period 2015 to 2020, Ethiopia aimed to increase power generating capacity from 4 GW in 2015 to 17 GW by 2020, with hydropower accounting for over 13 GW by 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2016). According to available data, Ethiopia has not met these targets, with about 4 GW of installed hydropower generation capacity in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a).

In the new 10-year plan, the government aims to increase export of electricity, which will require investments in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal hinges on new hydropower projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) of 6 GW installed capacity and the Koysha dam of 2 GW installed capacity (Mpofu, 2021). In mid-June 2022, it was reported construction of the GERD was 88% complete and expected to be finished in 2023 (Ahmed Gomaa, 2022). The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Agency (GCCIA) is also evaluating the feasibility of an electricity link with Ethiopia to import hydropower, in an attempt to reduce reliance on oil and gas for power generation (Darby, 2018).

Hydropower projects, however, have faced delays, largely attributed to concerns over their sustainability, and their effect on downstream riparian states such as Egypt. There is significant disagreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Al Jazeera, 2020). Reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the negative environmental effects, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, while Ethiopia began to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile in June 2020 (Zane, 2020a, 2020b).

**Other renewable generation**

Ethiopia is participating in the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) funded by the Climate Investment Funds (Climate Investment Funds, 2020). Under the SREP, the 200 MW geothermal Aluto Langano project and 120 MW Assela project, under construction, have received funding along with a clean energy small and medium enterprise facility (Construction Review Online, 2021; IEA, 2022b).

Ethiopia is also part of the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program (World Bank, 2019). In April 2019, the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance initiated the second round of tenders for up to 750 MW. In the first round, two projects totalling 250 MW were both awarded to Saudi energy developer AWCA in September 2019. The projects are the first to be developed under Ethiopia’s new public-private partnership framework and are expected to avoid 0.32 MtCO2e per year (ACWA Power, 2019). However, many of these projects have also faced delays, with projects struggling to reach financial close (Ayele & Shen, 2022). While several challenges have been identified, one of the key challenges include foreign currency and convertibility barriers.


## Agriculture

Agriculture GHG emissions are responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). Emissions from agriculture are expected increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture/livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).

Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). Ethiopia has projects underway to reduce methane emissions from livestock including a project for the low emission development for the dairy sector with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.


## Transport

The latest available inventory data, from Ethiopia’s Second National Communication, indicates the transport sector accounted for 4% of national emissions in 2013; however, the updated NDC revised total energy emissions downward (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; Ministry of Environment and Forest, 2015).

The Ten Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector including increased rail infrastructure and utilisation and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight passengers (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy which aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

**Electric Rail**

Ethiopia’s updated NDC aims to electrify transportation, reducing demand for petroleum and increasing the share of electric vehicles. According to the CRGE strategy, the building of an electric railway network such as the 5,000 km electrified National Railway Network (NRN) has the greatest mitigation potential for the sector of the assessed interventions (FDRE, 2011). One segment of the NRN, the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line, began commercial operations in January 2018 financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2018). As a landlocked country, the Ethiopia-Djibouti line is critical to shifting road transportation to rail as it connects Ethiopia to the Port of Doraleh. A second railway line, previously delayed due to a lack of finance, had been damaged in the civil war (Abiye, 2019; Ethiopia Observer, 2021). The Ten Year Development Plan aims to increase the length of railway from about 900 km to almost 4,200 km, but it does not specify how much of this would be electric (Planning and Development Commission, 2021).

**Public Transportation**

The updated NDC also aims to improve public transportation. Significant projects are underway in the capital, Addis Ababa, through the construction of a light rail transit (LRT) and a bus rapid transit (BRT). The LRT was completed in 2015 with support of the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2019). The Ten Year Development Plan further aims to increase the capacity of the LRT from 75,000 to 200,000 passengers per day (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The construction of the BRT started in 2020 with support from the French Development Agency (AFD), South Korea and the city itself (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020a; Fikade, 2018; Gebre, 2019). The BRT is not yet operational as of August 2022.

Ethiopia anticipates meeting much of its updated NDC through reductions in emissions from the forestry sector (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

In May 2019, Ethiopia launched its National Green Development programme, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which included a plan to plant four billion trees in 2019 (Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). As part of this effort, Ethiopia claims to have planted more than 350 million trees in a single day and to have reached the a total of four billion planted trees and seedlings by year’s end, though some have questioned the veracity of these figures provided by the government (BBC News, 2019, 2020; Mwai, 2019; National Green Development, 2020; Office of the Prime Minister, 2019). In 2020, the government aimed to plant another five billion trees that year and in 2021, the annual goal was six billion(Ethiopian Monitor, 2021; Getachew, 2020). Government reporting claims both goals were exceeded. The fourth round of tree-planting was launched in June 2022 with the goal of planting another six billion trees (Ethiopian Monitor, 2022).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Ethiopia provided revised historical data for 2010 in its NDC update using global warming potential values (GWPs) from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The government provides sector-level emissions data, but no information on the gas-by-gas breakdown. It also provided information on emissions data from livestock and managed soils, which we take to be the entirety of agriculture sector emissions.

To complete the sector information for the industry and managed soils sectors, we used the sector-by-sector emission ratios for the NDC’s 2020 business as usual estimate. We use the gas-by-gas breakdown in PRIMAP for the year 2010 to estimate sectoral emissions by gas and then converted these from AR5 to AR4 values (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The NDC update covers the three main gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O). We added an estimate for HFCs using PRIMAP data for 2010 and scaling this estimate to our industry sector’s emissions total for 2010.

We used PRIMAP growth rates for the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste to extend the historical time series for 1990-2019 based off of the 2010 estimate provided in the NDC update.

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.


## NDC and other targets

2030 NDC target

Ethiopia provides an estimate of each sector’s mitigation contribution to meeting its unconditional and conditional targets in its final NDC update submitted in July 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). These estimates are given using AR5 GWP values. We exclude the contribution of LULUCF, which we assume to be CO2 only, and then convert all other sector from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for 2010 historic data from PRIMAP (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The estimate provided in the final NDC update is for the main three gases only (CO2, CH4 and N2O). Our historical and current policy projections also include HFCs, however their contribution is very small and we have not taken it into account here.


## Current policy projections

We use a combination of data sources to estimate the lower bound of our current policy projection (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Lower bound projections

Our energy-related CO2 emissions are based on growth rates from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) for Ethiopia in the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA, 2019). In general, neither the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report nor its annexes specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA STEPS scenario was not updated in the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022a).

For the industry sector, we used the business as usual (BAU) projections from the updated NDC harmonised to our 2021 historical emissions estimate.

For the agriculture and waste sectors, we used the US EPA’s non-CO2 emissions projection but applied these to sector totals as the contribution from CO2 in these sectors is negligible. For “other” emissions reported in PRIMAP (about 1% of emissions in 2019), we applied US EPA growth rates for N2O as these “other” emissions only included N2O.

Upper bound projections

The upper-bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the revised business as usual (BAU) scenario projections provided in the updated NDC of 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The base year for the BAU scenario is 2010. We have harmonised the series to the last historical year estimate (2021). This approach could potentially overestimate emission levels as we do not have sufficient information on the state of emissions reduction efforts or current policy implementation, both of which might downward revise the trajectory.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional NDC target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). The government is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Ethiopia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

Ethiopia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within Ethiopia’s border.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet its conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.


## NDC Updates

Ethiopia submitted its final updated NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement from Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).

The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from LULUCF emissions in 2030. The updated, 2021 NDC further indicates the LULUCF sector would play a much larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily (around 85% of total reductions) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Due to this increased reliance on the land sector to achieve its updated targets, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.

The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 269 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 237 MtCO2e (see Assumptions for details on how these figures were calculated).

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target (“internationally supported target”) as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target (“fair share target”) as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- **22.07.2021:** Ethiopia submits final updated NDC
- **31.12.2020:** Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”.

**For the full analysis, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

Under the Copenhagen Accord, Ethiopia proposed several Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the power, transport, forestry, agriculture and waste management sectors (FDRE, 2010). Limited information is available on the status of implementation of the NAMAs (UNFCCC, 2019).


# Summary


## Overview

**Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances.**

**In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC,** **but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated.**

**The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.**

Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements.

Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.

Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022). This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).

For further information on the targets Ethiopia has adopted, see the targets tab.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Ethiopia does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality.
- **Emissions coverage** – Ethiopia states its intention to become “carbon neutral” (FDRE, 2015). For this reason, the CAT currently assumes Ethiopia’s target currently only covers CO2 emissions. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia had not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC as of August 2022 and did not reference the carbon neutrality target in its 2021 updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from GGGI, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios (GGGI, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will achieve unconditional and conditional NDC targets if current policies are fully implemented, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are "Critically insufficient" when compared with what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways say should be occurring within its borders. This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the updated NDC’s business-as-usual scenario for which we do not know which policies it includes. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.


## Policy overview

Since the end of 2020, Ethiopia has been engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and has driven a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The conflict has led to the most severe starvation crisis in the world, with famine affecting an estimated 900,000 Ethiopians and 1.8 million on the brink (Council on Foreign Relations, 2022). The deal agrees to restore services to the Tigray region and allow unrestricted access for aid agencies (NPR, 2022)

Climate policy has advanced little since our last update, unsurprising given the current political climate. Prior to the outbreak of the war, Ethiopia had been making headway, working on updating its 2011 Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and long-term strategy. The status of the CRGE update is unclear, but the Ethiopian government has engaged in further work to progress the long-term strategy (GGGI, 2022).

The basis of Ethiopia’s mitigation policy is its Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, published in 2011 (FDRE, 2011). As the name suggests, the strategy aims to keep greenhouse gas emissions low and build climate resilience, while achieving middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia is currently reviewing progress and updating the CRGE strategy, which should take into consideration Ethiopia’s updated NDC.

In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The new plan aims to bring economic growth, expecting 10.2% annual growth, while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020b). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s so-called greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan further includes similar emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.

Under current policy projections, GHG emissions in Ethiopia are expected to be 213–240 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)). Emissions are higher than our last update. The increase is largely driven by an upward revision of historical emissions in 2016-2018 and the likely limited long-term impact of the pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have on emissions.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.


## Energy supply

Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.

Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power.

**Hydropower**

For the period 2015 to 2020, Ethiopia aimed to increase power generating capacity from 4 GW in 2015 to 17 GW by 2020, with hydropower accounting for over 13 GW by 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2016). According to available data, Ethiopia has not met these targets, with about 4 GW of installed hydropower generation capacity in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a).

In the new 10-year plan, the government aims to increase export of electricity, which will require investments in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal hinges on new hydropower projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) of 6 GW installed capacity and the Koysha dam of 2 GW installed capacity (Mpofu, 2021). In mid-June 2022, it was reported construction of the GERD was 88% complete and expected to be finished in 2023 (Ahmed Gomaa, 2022). The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Agency (GCCIA) is also evaluating the feasibility of an electricity link with Ethiopia to import hydropower, in an attempt to reduce reliance on oil and gas for power generation (Darby, 2018).

Hydropower projects, however, have faced delays, largely attributed to concerns over their sustainability, and their effect on downstream riparian states such as Egypt. There is significant disagreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Al Jazeera, 2020). Reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the negative environmental effects, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, while Ethiopia began to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile in June 2020 (Zane, 2020a, 2020b).

**Other renewable generation**

Ethiopia is participating in the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) funded by the Climate Investment Funds (Climate Investment Funds, 2020). Under the SREP, the 200 MW geothermal Aluto Langano project and 120 MW Assela project, under construction, have received funding along with a clean energy small and medium enterprise facility (Construction Review Online, 2021; IEA, 2022b).

Ethiopia is also part of the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program (World Bank, 2019). In April 2019, the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance initiated the second round of tenders for up to 750 MW. In the first round, two projects totalling 250 MW were both awarded to Saudi energy developer AWCA in September 2019. The projects are the first to be developed under Ethiopia’s new public-private partnership framework and are expected to avoid 0.32 MtCO2e per year (ACWA Power, 2019). However, many of these projects have also faced delays, with projects struggling to reach financial close (Ayele & Shen, 2022). While several challenges have been identified, one of the key challenges include foreign currency and convertibility barriers.


## Agriculture

Agriculture GHG emissions are responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). Emissions from agriculture are expected increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture/livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).

Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). Ethiopia has projects underway to reduce methane emissions from livestock including a project for the low emission development for the dairy sector with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.


## Transport

The latest available inventory data, from Ethiopia’s Second National Communication, indicates the transport sector accounted for 4% of national emissions in 2013; however, the updated NDC revised total energy emissions downward (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; Ministry of Environment and Forest, 2015).

The Ten Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector including increased rail infrastructure and utilisation and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight passengers (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy which aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

**Electric Rail**

Ethiopia’s updated NDC aims to electrify transportation, reducing demand for petroleum and increasing the share of electric vehicles. According to the CRGE strategy, the building of an electric railway network such as the 5,000 km electrified National Railway Network (NRN) has the greatest mitigation potential for the sector of the assessed interventions (FDRE, 2011). One segment of the NRN, the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line, began commercial operations in January 2018 financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2018). As a landlocked country, the Ethiopia-Djibouti line is critical to shifting road transportation to rail as it connects Ethiopia to the Port of Doraleh. A second railway line, previously delayed due to a lack of finance, had been damaged in the civil war (Abiye, 2019; Ethiopia Observer, 2021). The Ten Year Development Plan aims to increase the length of railway from about 900 km to almost 4,200 km, but it does not specify how much of this would be electric (Planning and Development Commission, 2021).

**Public Transportation**

The updated NDC also aims to improve public transportation. Significant projects are underway in the capital, Addis Ababa, through the construction of a light rail transit (LRT) and a bus rapid transit (BRT). The LRT was completed in 2015 with support of the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2019). The Ten Year Development Plan further aims to increase the capacity of the LRT from 75,000 to 200,000 passengers per day (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The construction of the BRT started in 2020 with support from the French Development Agency (AFD), South Korea and the city itself (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020a; Fikade, 2018; Gebre, 2019). The BRT is not yet operational as of August 2022.

Ethiopia anticipates meeting much of its updated NDC through reductions in emissions from the forestry sector (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

In May 2019, Ethiopia launched its National Green Development programme, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which included a plan to plant four billion trees in 2019 (Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). As part of this effort, Ethiopia claims to have planted more than 350 million trees in a single day and to have reached the a total of four billion planted trees and seedlings by year’s end, though some have questioned the veracity of these figures provided by the government (BBC News, 2019, 2020; Mwai, 2019; National Green Development, 2020; Office of the Prime Minister, 2019). In 2020, the government aimed to plant another five billion trees that year and in 2021, the annual goal was six billion(Ethiopian Monitor, 2021; Getachew, 2020). Government reporting claims both goals were exceeded. The fourth round of tree-planting was launched in June 2022 with the goal of planting another six billion trees (Ethiopian Monitor, 2022).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Ethiopia provided revised historical data for 2010 in its NDC update using global warming potential values (GWPs) from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The government provides sector-level emissions data, but no information on the gas-by-gas breakdown. It also provided information on emissions data from livestock and managed soils, which we take to be the entirety of agriculture sector emissions.

To complete the sector information for the industry and managed soils sectors, we used the sector-by-sector emission ratios for the NDC’s 2020 business as usual estimate. We use the gas-by-gas breakdown in PRIMAP for the year 2010 to estimate sectoral emissions by gas and then converted these from AR5 to AR4 values (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The NDC update covers the three main gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O). We added an estimate for HFCs using PRIMAP data for 2010 and scaling this estimate to our industry sector’s emissions total for 2010.

We used PRIMAP growth rates for the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste to extend the historical time series for 1990-2019 based off of the 2010 estimate provided in the NDC update.

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.


## NDC and other targets

2030 NDC target

Ethiopia provides an estimate of each sector’s mitigation contribution to meeting its unconditional and conditional targets in its final NDC update submitted in July 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). These estimates are given using AR5 GWP values. We exclude the contribution of LULUCF, which we assume to be CO2 only, and then convert all other sector from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for 2010 historic data from PRIMAP (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The estimate provided in the final NDC update is for the main three gases only (CO2, CH4 and N2O). Our historical and current policy projections also include HFCs, however their contribution is very small and we have not taken it into account here.


## Current policy projections

We use a combination of data sources to estimate the lower bound of our current policy projection (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Lower bound projections

Our energy-related CO2 emissions are based on growth rates from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) for Ethiopia in the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA, 2019). In general, neither the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report nor its annexes specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA STEPS scenario was not updated in the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022a).

For the industry sector, we used the business as usual (BAU) projections from the updated NDC harmonised to our 2021 historical emissions estimate.

For the agriculture and waste sectors, we used the US EPA’s non-CO2 emissions projection but applied these to sector totals as the contribution from CO2 in these sectors is negligible. For “other” emissions reported in PRIMAP (about 1% of emissions in 2019), we applied US EPA growth rates for N2O as these “other” emissions only included N2O.

Upper bound projections

The upper-bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the revised business as usual (BAU) scenario projections provided in the updated NDC of 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The base year for the BAU scenario is 2010. We have harmonised the series to the last historical year estimate (2021). This approach could potentially overestimate emission levels as we do not have sufficient information on the state of emissions reduction efforts or current policy implementation, both of which might downward revise the trajectory.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional NDC target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). The government is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Ethiopia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

Ethiopia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within Ethiopia’s border.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet its conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.


## NDC Updates

Ethiopia submitted its final updated NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement from Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).

The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from LULUCF emissions in 2030. The updated, 2021 NDC further indicates the LULUCF sector would play a much larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily (around 85% of total reductions) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Due to this increased reliance on the land sector to achieve its updated targets, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.

The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 269 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 237 MtCO2e (see Assumptions for details on how these figures were calculated).

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target (“internationally supported target”) as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target (“fair share target”) as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- **22.07.2021:** Ethiopia submits final updated NDC
- **31.12.2020:** Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”.

**For the full analysis, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

Under the Copenhagen Accord, Ethiopia proposed several Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the power, transport, forestry, agriculture and waste management sectors (FDRE, 2010). Limited information is available on the status of implementation of the NAMAs (UNFCCC, 2019).


# Summary


## Overview

**Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances.**

**In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC,** **but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated.**

**The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.**

Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements.

Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.

Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022). This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).

For further information on the targets Ethiopia has adopted, see the targets tab.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Ethiopia does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality.
- **Emissions coverage** – Ethiopia states its intention to become “carbon neutral” (FDRE, 2015). For this reason, the CAT currently assumes Ethiopia’s target currently only covers CO2 emissions. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia had not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC as of August 2022 and did not reference the carbon neutrality target in its 2021 updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from GGGI, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios (GGGI, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will achieve unconditional and conditional NDC targets if current policies are fully implemented, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are "Critically insufficient" when compared with what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways say should be occurring within its borders. This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the updated NDC’s business-as-usual scenario for which we do not know which policies it includes. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.


## Policy overview

Since the end of 2020, Ethiopia has been engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and has driven a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The conflict has led to the most severe starvation crisis in the world, with famine affecting an estimated 900,000 Ethiopians and 1.8 million on the brink (Council on Foreign Relations, 2022). The deal agrees to restore services to the Tigray region and allow unrestricted access for aid agencies (NPR, 2022)

Climate policy has advanced little since our last update, unsurprising given the current political climate. Prior to the outbreak of the war, Ethiopia had been making headway, working on updating its 2011 Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and long-term strategy. The status of the CRGE update is unclear, but the Ethiopian government has engaged in further work to progress the long-term strategy (GGGI, 2022).

The basis of Ethiopia’s mitigation policy is its Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, published in 2011 (FDRE, 2011). As the name suggests, the strategy aims to keep greenhouse gas emissions low and build climate resilience, while achieving middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia is currently reviewing progress and updating the CRGE strategy, which should take into consideration Ethiopia’s updated NDC.

In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The new plan aims to bring economic growth, expecting 10.2% annual growth, while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020b). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s so-called greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan further includes similar emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.

Under current policy projections, GHG emissions in Ethiopia are expected to be 213–240 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)). Emissions are higher than our last update. The increase is largely driven by an upward revision of historical emissions in 2016-2018 and the likely limited long-term impact of the pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have on emissions.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.


## Energy supply

Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.

Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power.

**Hydropower**

For the period 2015 to 2020, Ethiopia aimed to increase power generating capacity from 4 GW in 2015 to 17 GW by 2020, with hydropower accounting for over 13 GW by 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2016). According to available data, Ethiopia has not met these targets, with about 4 GW of installed hydropower generation capacity in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a).

In the new 10-year plan, the government aims to increase export of electricity, which will require investments in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal hinges on new hydropower projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) of 6 GW installed capacity and the Koysha dam of 2 GW installed capacity (Mpofu, 2021). In mid-June 2022, it was reported construction of the GERD was 88% complete and expected to be finished in 2023 (Ahmed Gomaa, 2022). The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Agency (GCCIA) is also evaluating the feasibility of an electricity link with Ethiopia to import hydropower, in an attempt to reduce reliance on oil and gas for power generation (Darby, 2018).

Hydropower projects, however, have faced delays, largely attributed to concerns over their sustainability, and their effect on downstream riparian states such as Egypt. There is significant disagreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Al Jazeera, 2020). Reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the negative environmental effects, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, while Ethiopia began to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile in June 2020 (Zane, 2020a, 2020b).

**Other renewable generation**

Ethiopia is participating in the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) funded by the Climate Investment Funds (Climate Investment Funds, 2020). Under the SREP, the 200 MW geothermal Aluto Langano project and 120 MW Assela project, under construction, have received funding along with a clean energy small and medium enterprise facility (Construction Review Online, 2021; IEA, 2022b).

Ethiopia is also part of the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program (World Bank, 2019). In April 2019, the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance initiated the second round of tenders for up to 750 MW. In the first round, two projects totalling 250 MW were both awarded to Saudi energy developer AWCA in September 2019. The projects are the first to be developed under Ethiopia’s new public-private partnership framework and are expected to avoid 0.32 MtCO2e per year (ACWA Power, 2019). However, many of these projects have also faced delays, with projects struggling to reach financial close (Ayele & Shen, 2022). While several challenges have been identified, one of the key challenges include foreign currency and convertibility barriers.


## Agriculture

Agriculture GHG emissions are responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). Emissions from agriculture are expected increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture/livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).

Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). Ethiopia has projects underway to reduce methane emissions from livestock including a project for the low emission development for the dairy sector with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.


## Transport

The latest available inventory data, from Ethiopia’s Second National Communication, indicates the transport sector accounted for 4% of national emissions in 2013; however, the updated NDC revised total energy emissions downward (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; Ministry of Environment and Forest, 2015).

The Ten Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector including increased rail infrastructure and utilisation and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight passengers (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy which aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

**Electric Rail**

Ethiopia’s updated NDC aims to electrify transportation, reducing demand for petroleum and increasing the share of electric vehicles. According to the CRGE strategy, the building of an electric railway network such as the 5,000 km electrified National Railway Network (NRN) has the greatest mitigation potential for the sector of the assessed interventions (FDRE, 2011). One segment of the NRN, the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line, began commercial operations in January 2018 financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2018). As a landlocked country, the Ethiopia-Djibouti line is critical to shifting road transportation to rail as it connects Ethiopia to the Port of Doraleh. A second railway line, previously delayed due to a lack of finance, had been damaged in the civil war (Abiye, 2019; Ethiopia Observer, 2021). The Ten Year Development Plan aims to increase the length of railway from about 900 km to almost 4,200 km, but it does not specify how much of this would be electric (Planning and Development Commission, 2021).

**Public Transportation**

The updated NDC also aims to improve public transportation. Significant projects are underway in the capital, Addis Ababa, through the construction of a light rail transit (LRT) and a bus rapid transit (BRT). The LRT was completed in 2015 with support of the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2019). The Ten Year Development Plan further aims to increase the capacity of the LRT from 75,000 to 200,000 passengers per day (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The construction of the BRT started in 2020 with support from the French Development Agency (AFD), South Korea and the city itself (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020a; Fikade, 2018; Gebre, 2019). The BRT is not yet operational as of August 2022.

Ethiopia anticipates meeting much of its updated NDC through reductions in emissions from the forestry sector (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

In May 2019, Ethiopia launched its National Green Development programme, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which included a plan to plant four billion trees in 2019 (Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). As part of this effort, Ethiopia claims to have planted more than 350 million trees in a single day and to have reached the a total of four billion planted trees and seedlings by year’s end, though some have questioned the veracity of these figures provided by the government (BBC News, 2019, 2020; Mwai, 2019; National Green Development, 2020; Office of the Prime Minister, 2019). In 2020, the government aimed to plant another five billion trees that year and in 2021, the annual goal was six billion(Ethiopian Monitor, 2021; Getachew, 2020). Government reporting claims both goals were exceeded. The fourth round of tree-planting was launched in June 2022 with the goal of planting another six billion trees (Ethiopian Monitor, 2022).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Ethiopia provided revised historical data for 2010 in its NDC update using global warming potential values (GWPs) from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The government provides sector-level emissions data, but no information on the gas-by-gas breakdown. It also provided information on emissions data from livestock and managed soils, which we take to be the entirety of agriculture sector emissions.

To complete the sector information for the industry and managed soils sectors, we used the sector-by-sector emission ratios for the NDC’s 2020 business as usual estimate. We use the gas-by-gas breakdown in PRIMAP for the year 2010 to estimate sectoral emissions by gas and then converted these from AR5 to AR4 values (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The NDC update covers the three main gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O). We added an estimate for HFCs using PRIMAP data for 2010 and scaling this estimate to our industry sector’s emissions total for 2010.

We used PRIMAP growth rates for the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste to extend the historical time series for 1990-2019 based off of the 2010 estimate provided in the NDC update.

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.


## NDC and other targets

2030 NDC target

Ethiopia provides an estimate of each sector’s mitigation contribution to meeting its unconditional and conditional targets in its final NDC update submitted in July 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). These estimates are given using AR5 GWP values. We exclude the contribution of LULUCF, which we assume to be CO2 only, and then convert all other sector from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for 2010 historic data from PRIMAP (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The estimate provided in the final NDC update is for the main three gases only (CO2, CH4 and N2O). Our historical and current policy projections also include HFCs, however their contribution is very small and we have not taken it into account here.


## Current policy projections

We use a combination of data sources to estimate the lower bound of our current policy projection (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Lower bound projections

Our energy-related CO2 emissions are based on growth rates from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) for Ethiopia in the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA, 2019). In general, neither the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report nor its annexes specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA STEPS scenario was not updated in the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022a).

For the industry sector, we used the business as usual (BAU) projections from the updated NDC harmonised to our 2021 historical emissions estimate.

For the agriculture and waste sectors, we used the US EPA’s non-CO2 emissions projection but applied these to sector totals as the contribution from CO2 in these sectors is negligible. For “other” emissions reported in PRIMAP (about 1% of emissions in 2019), we applied US EPA growth rates for N2O as these “other” emissions only included N2O.

Upper bound projections

The upper-bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the revised business as usual (BAU) scenario projections provided in the updated NDC of 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The base year for the BAU scenario is 2010. We have harmonised the series to the last historical year estimate (2021). This approach could potentially overestimate emission levels as we do not have sufficient information on the state of emissions reduction efforts or current policy implementation, both of which might downward revise the trajectory.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional NDC target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). The government is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Ethiopia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

Ethiopia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within Ethiopia’s border.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet its conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.


## NDC Updates

Ethiopia submitted its final updated NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement from Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).

The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from LULUCF emissions in 2030. The updated, 2021 NDC further indicates the LULUCF sector would play a much larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily (around 85% of total reductions) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Due to this increased reliance on the land sector to achieve its updated targets, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.

The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 269 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 237 MtCO2e (see Assumptions for details on how these figures were calculated).

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target (“internationally supported target”) as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target (“fair share target”) as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- **22.07.2021:** Ethiopia submits final updated NDC
- **31.12.2020:** Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”.

## 2020 pledge

Under the Copenhagen Accord, Ethiopia proposed several Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the power, transport, forestry, agriculture and waste management sectors (FDRE, 2010). Limited information is available on the status of implementation of the NAMAs (UNFCCC, 2019).


# Summary


## Overview

**Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances.**

**In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC,** **but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated.**

**The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.**

Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements.

Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”

# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.

Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022). This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).

For further information on the targets Ethiopia has adopted, see the targets tab.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

No information on the target’s emission coverage

No information on the target’s intention to cover international aviation and shipping

Provides no information on intention to use international offset credits to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No information on intention to separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets (note: this option applies to countries that have only announced a target, with no accompanying law / policy)

No information on intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Country provides no information on anticipated pathways or measures

Country provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Ethiopia does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality.
- **Emissions coverage** – Ethiopia states its intention to become “carbon neutral” (FDRE, 2015). For this reason, the CAT currently assumes Ethiopia’s target currently only covers CO2 emissions. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.
- **International aviation and shipping** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia had not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC as of August 2022 and did not reference the carbon neutrality target in its 2021 updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from GGGI, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios (GGGI, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will achieve unconditional and conditional NDC targets if current policies are fully implemented, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are "Critically insufficient" when compared with what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways say should be occurring within its borders. This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the updated NDC’s business-as-usual scenario for which we do not know which policies it includes. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.


## Policy overview

Since the end of 2020, Ethiopia has been engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and has driven a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The conflict has led to the most severe starvation crisis in the world, with famine affecting an estimated 900,000 Ethiopians and 1.8 million on the brink (Council on Foreign Relations, 2022). The deal agrees to restore services to the Tigray region and allow unrestricted access for aid agencies (NPR, 2022)

Climate policy has advanced little since our last update, unsurprising given the current political climate. Prior to the outbreak of the war, Ethiopia had been making headway, working on updating its 2011 Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and long-term strategy. The status of the CRGE update is unclear, but the Ethiopian government has engaged in further work to progress the long-term strategy (GGGI, 2022).

The basis of Ethiopia’s mitigation policy is its Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, published in 2011 (FDRE, 2011). As the name suggests, the strategy aims to keep greenhouse gas emissions low and build climate resilience, while achieving middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia is currently reviewing progress and updating the CRGE strategy, which should take into consideration Ethiopia’s updated NDC.

In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The new plan aims to bring economic growth, expecting 10.2% annual growth, while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020b). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s so-called greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan further includes similar emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.

Under current policy projections, GHG emissions in Ethiopia are expected to be 213–240 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)). Emissions are higher than our last update. The increase is largely driven by an upward revision of historical emissions in 2016-2018 and the likely limited long-term impact of the pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have on emissions.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.


## Energy supply

Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.

Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power.

**Hydropower**

For the period 2015 to 2020, Ethiopia aimed to increase power generating capacity from 4 GW in 2015 to 17 GW by 2020, with hydropower accounting for over 13 GW by 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2016). According to available data, Ethiopia has not met these targets, with about 4 GW of installed hydropower generation capacity in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a).

In the new 10-year plan, the government aims to increase export of electricity, which will require investments in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal hinges on new hydropower projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) of 6 GW installed capacity and the Koysha dam of 2 GW installed capacity (Mpofu, 2021). In mid-June 2022, it was reported construction of the GERD was 88% complete and expected to be finished in 2023 (Ahmed Gomaa, 2022). The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Agency (GCCIA) is also evaluating the feasibility of an electricity link with Ethiopia to import hydropower, in an attempt to reduce reliance on oil and gas for power generation (Darby, 2018).

Hydropower projects, however, have faced delays, largely attributed to concerns over their sustainability, and their effect on downstream riparian states such as Egypt. There is significant disagreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Al Jazeera, 2020). Reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the negative environmental effects, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, while Ethiopia began to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile in June 2020 (Zane, 2020a, 2020b).

**Other renewable generation**

Ethiopia is participating in the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) funded by the Climate Investment Funds (Climate Investment Funds, 2020). Under the SREP, the 200 MW geothermal Aluto Langano project and 120 MW Assela project, under construction, have received funding along with a clean energy small and medium enterprise facility (Construction Review Online, 2021; IEA, 2022b).

Ethiopia is also part of the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program (World Bank, 2019). In April 2019, the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance initiated the second round of tenders for up to 750 MW. In the first round, two projects totalling 250 MW were both awarded to Saudi energy developer AWCA in September 2019. The projects are the first to be developed under Ethiopia’s new public-private partnership framework and are expected to avoid 0.32 MtCO2e per year (ACWA Power, 2019). However, many of these projects have also faced delays, with projects struggling to reach financial close (Ayele & Shen, 2022). While several challenges have been identified, one of the key challenges include foreign currency and convertibility barriers.


## Agriculture

Agriculture GHG emissions are responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). Emissions from agriculture are expected increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture/livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).

Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). Ethiopia has projects underway to reduce methane emissions from livestock including a project for the low emission development for the dairy sector with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.


## Transport

The latest available inventory data, from Ethiopia’s Second National Communication, indicates the transport sector accounted for 4% of national emissions in 2013; however, the updated NDC revised total energy emissions downward (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; Ministry of Environment and Forest, 2015).

The Ten Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector including increased rail infrastructure and utilisation and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight passengers (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy which aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

**Electric Rail**

Ethiopia’s updated NDC aims to electrify transportation, reducing demand for petroleum and increasing the share of electric vehicles. According to the CRGE strategy, the building of an electric railway network such as the 5,000 km electrified National Railway Network (NRN) has the greatest mitigation potential for the sector of the assessed interventions (FDRE, 2011). One segment of the NRN, the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line, began commercial operations in January 2018 financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2018). As a landlocked country, the Ethiopia-Djibouti line is critical to shifting road transportation to rail as it connects Ethiopia to the Port of Doraleh. A second railway line, previously delayed due to a lack of finance, had been damaged in the civil war (Abiye, 2019; Ethiopia Observer, 2021). The Ten Year Development Plan aims to increase the length of railway from about 900 km to almost 4,200 km, but it does not specify how much of this would be electric (Planning and Development Commission, 2021).

**Public Transportation**

The updated NDC also aims to improve public transportation. Significant projects are underway in the capital, Addis Ababa, through the construction of a light rail transit (LRT) and a bus rapid transit (BRT). The LRT was completed in 2015 with support of the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2019). The Ten Year Development Plan further aims to increase the capacity of the LRT from 75,000 to 200,000 passengers per day (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The construction of the BRT started in 2020 with support from the French Development Agency (AFD), South Korea and the city itself (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020a; Fikade, 2018; Gebre, 2019). The BRT is not yet operational as of August 2022.

Ethiopia anticipates meeting much of its updated NDC through reductions in emissions from the forestry sector (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

In May 2019, Ethiopia launched its National Green Development programme, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which included a plan to plant four billion trees in 2019 (Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). As part of this effort, Ethiopia claims to have planted more than 350 million trees in a single day and to have reached the a total of four billion planted trees and seedlings by year’s end, though some have questioned the veracity of these figures provided by the government (BBC News, 2019, 2020; Mwai, 2019; National Green Development, 2020; Office of the Prime Minister, 2019). In 2020, the government aimed to plant another five billion trees that year and in 2021, the annual goal was six billion(Ethiopian Monitor, 2021; Getachew, 2020). Government reporting claims both goals were exceeded. The fourth round of tree-planting was launched in June 2022 with the goal of planting another six billion trees (Ethiopian Monitor, 2022).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Ethiopia provided revised historical data for 2010 in its NDC update using global warming potential values (GWPs) from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The government provides sector-level emissions data, but no information on the gas-by-gas breakdown. It also provided information on emissions data from livestock and managed soils, which we take to be the entirety of agriculture sector emissions.

To complete the sector information for the industry and managed soils sectors, we used the sector-by-sector emission ratios for the NDC’s 2020 business as usual estimate. We use the gas-by-gas breakdown in PRIMAP for the year 2010 to estimate sectoral emissions by gas and then converted these from AR5 to AR4 values (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The NDC update covers the three main gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O). We added an estimate for HFCs using PRIMAP data for 2010 and scaling this estimate to our industry sector’s emissions total for 2010.

We used PRIMAP growth rates for the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste to extend the historical time series for 1990-2019 based off of the 2010 estimate provided in the NDC update.

To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.


## NDC and other targets

2030 NDC target

Ethiopia provides an estimate of each sector’s mitigation contribution to meeting its unconditional and conditional targets in its final NDC update submitted in July 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). These estimates are given using AR5 GWP values. We exclude the contribution of LULUCF, which we assume to be CO2 only, and then convert all other sector from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for 2010 historic data from PRIMAP (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).

The estimate provided in the final NDC update is for the main three gases only (CO2, CH4 and N2O). Our historical and current policy projections also include HFCs, however their contribution is very small and we have not taken it into account here.


## Current policy projections

We use a combination of data sources to estimate the lower bound of our current policy projection (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).

Lower bound projections

Our energy-related CO2 emissions are based on growth rates from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) for Ethiopia in the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA, 2019). In general, neither the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report nor its annexes specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA STEPS scenario was not updated in the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022a).

For the industry sector, we used the business as usual (BAU) projections from the updated NDC harmonised to our 2021 historical emissions estimate.

For the agriculture and waste sectors, we used the US EPA’s non-CO2 emissions projection but applied these to sector totals as the contribution from CO2 in these sectors is negligible. For “other” emissions reported in PRIMAP (about 1% of emissions in 2019), we applied US EPA growth rates for N2O as these “other” emissions only included N2O.

Upper bound projections

The upper-bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the revised business as usual (BAU) scenario projections provided in the updated NDC of 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The base year for the BAU scenario is 2010. We have harmonised the series to the last historical year estimate (2021). This approach could potentially overestimate emission levels as we do not have sufficient information on the state of emissions reduction efforts or current policy implementation, both of which might downward revise the trajectory.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional NDC target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). The government is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy.


## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Ethiopia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.

Ethiopia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within Ethiopia’s border.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet its conditional NDC target.

Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.

Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.


## NDC Updates

Ethiopia submitted its final updated NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement from Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).

The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from LULUCF emissions in 2030. The updated, 2021 NDC further indicates the LULUCF sector would play a much larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily (around 85% of total reductions) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Due to this increased reliance on the land sector to achieve its updated targets, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.

The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 269 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 237 MtCO2e (see Assumptions for details on how these figures were calculated).

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target (“internationally supported target”) as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target (“fair share target”) as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- **22.07.2021:** Ethiopia submits final updated NDC
- **31.12.2020:** Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”.

**For the full analysis, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

Under the Copenhagen Accord, Ethiopia proposed several Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the power, transport, forestry, agriculture and waste management sectors (FDRE, 2010). Limited information is available on the status of implementation of the NAMAs (UNFCCC, 2019).


# Summary


## Overview

**Ethiopia’s climate action illustrates the challenge of improving economic growth and energy access while enhancing climate mitigation action. The government announced an NDC implementation plan in July 2024, signalling a better commitment to reducing emissions, more integrated actions and a call for international support. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies, which will allow emissions to steadily increase and indicates that its targets could be more ambitious and also be strengthen. We continue to rate Ethiopia’s climate targets and action as “Almost sufficient”.**

In 2024, Ethiopia became the first country in the world to ban the importation of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). To accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), the government removed VAT, surtax, and excise taxes on EV imports while reducing the import tax on partially assembled EVs. This policy supports Ethiopia’s target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal first announced in 2015, while also enhancing the country’s energy security by reducing the amount of imported oil.

Ethiopia published a Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) in July 2023 exploring multiple pathways to achieving net zero between 2035 and 2050. Based on the government estimates, the investments required to achieve net zero by 2050 range from USD 138 to USD 272 billion. The plan is aligned with Ethiopia's 10-year development plan and Updated National Determined Contribution (NDC).

Agriculture drives the Ethiopian economy, accounting for nearly 40% of GDP, employing 80% of the workforce, and contributing 90% of the country’s foreign currency through exports. It accounts for about 75% of emissions (excl. LULUCF). However, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors and expected climate change induced hazards reduce an estimated 4% of the GDP. In 2024, Ethiopia published Climate Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) which outlines priority investment areas and strategies to enhance the agriculture sector resilience, sustainability, and productivity.

This CRGE strategy is the basis of the country’s climate action. It was launched in 2011, aiming to achieve middle-income country status by 2025. However, it faces several challenges in delivery due to the lack of representative data at national level. The government conducted an implementation review in 2020, which found no evidence of emission reductions since the CRGE strategy was introduced. The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that the government has made progress on monitoring and evaluation processes as well as updating the CRGE strategy but does not specify when the update process began. As of early 2025, no updated version of the CRGE has been published.

In 2024, Ethiopia advanced its carbon finance efforts through a reforestation project aimed at restoring 12,000 hectares of native forest, with the goal of sequestering 7.26 million tonnes of CO₂ over 30 years. Ethiopia is planning to sell credits from forestry projects under Article 6. However, Ethiopia’s Article 6 strategy remains unclear, particularly regarding whether it includes safeguards to avoid missing its NDC target or failing to ratchet the ambition of its future NDC. Also, there are significant risks associated with forestry projects that the Article 6 rules might not be able to mitigate, such as inflated baselines and non-permanence.

Since the last update, there have been some positive development in Ethiopia’s climate action, such as:

- In 2024, Ethiopia published a 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) implementation plan, which details sector-specific strategies designed to achieve the targets outlined in its NDCs.
- In 2024, Ethiopia has published Climate Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) which outlines priority investment areas and strategies
- Ethiopia has deals with renewable energy companies based out of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to construct a 300MW wind farm and this initiative aligns with the National Energy Policy.
- In 2023, Ethiopia secured funding through the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL). As part of its implementation, the program has established 51 forest tree nurseries in deforestation hotspots and trained over 22,800 forest users in sustainable practices.
- The government has integrated its Ten-Year Development Plan into its updated NDC and LT-LEDS.
Given Ethiopia’s socio-economic situation and its low historic contribution to global GHG emissions, Ethiopia’s policies and targets represent a fair contribution to limiting global warming with its own resources, to actually reduce emissions to a level consistent with 1.5ºC it needs to decarbonise its economy and will require international support to do so. Key measures needed for strengthening Ethiopia’s climate action include:

- **Increasing the ambition of its conditional NDC target and quantifying the climate finance needed, including an implementation plan, to meet the set target.** Being able to access sufficient climate finance is crucial for Ethiopia’s efforts to reduce its emissions, particularly in the AFOLU sector which contributes 80% of total country emissions. More initiatives similar to the EU's Multiannual Indicative Programme (MIP), which allocates EUR 260 million grants for climate-related initiatives in Ethiopia under the Green Deals would be necessary.
- **Diversifying renewable energy sources** **to enhance energy security and resilience.** Ethiopia's future electricity grid will rely heavily on the recently-built Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Given that hydropower is directly dependent on water sources, it is vulnerable to climate variability and regional water scarcity issues.
- **Finding a lasting regional agreement between countries involved and affected by GERD hydropower project**. Given the regional dispute over GERD, it is important to work towards enhancing the resilience of hydropower to climate changes and fostering cooperation over shared water resources.
- **Adopting clean cooking practices** to reduce reliance on biomass and mitigate potential health risks. This could involve investing in soft infrastructure development regarding public and environmental health, such as raising awareness about the health impacts of traditional cooking practices.
- **Updating the CRGE, strengthening the human and fiscal capacity, and developing detailed measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems.** Information related to the progress of CRGE is difficult to find and not centralised. Fragmented data management is barrier to CRGE implementation. It is essential that data is well documented, transparent and consistent across sectors and all levels of government. Since these challenges are often driven by limited human and fiscal capacity, strengthening institutional capacity and improving resource allocation must be prioritized.
- **Improve its net-zero target** **architecture** through the following good practices such as providing clear sectoral pathways and policies necessary, especially for waste and LULUCF sector, to achieve the net-zero target by 2050. This target also should be accompanied by legal safeguards or institutional framework, to ensure the continuity across political cycle.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The Climate Action Tracker rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements.

Ethiopia is almost meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share. Ethiopia’s conditional NDC is rated as “Critically Insufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. As a country with lower responsibility, capability, and per-capita emissions, Ethiopia should receive international support to set an ambitious conditional NDC target beyond its national fair share and implement the policies necessary to achieve it.

Ethiopia can improve its rating by pledging a stronger conditional target compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.

Ethiopia launched its NDC implementation plan in July 2024 signalling a stronger climate commitment with more integrated actions. Ethiopia became the first country to ban ICEV imports, while introducing tax incentives to accelerate electric vehicle adoption. In 2023, Ethiopia published its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), aligning it with the Ten-Year Development Plan.

The Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, launched in 2011, remains the foundation of Ethiopia’s climate policy, though its implementation faces challenges due to limited representative data and weak coordination between sectors and governance levels.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF), conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally using its own resources.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target as “Critically Insufficient ” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s NDC conditional target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Ethiopia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.

Ethiopia should propose a conditional target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should thus be strengthened. Increased international support is needed to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Land use, land-use change and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily through reductions in land sector emissions (around 85% of total reductions).

In June 2023, Ethiopia submitted a Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) for 2020-2050. The LT-LEDS outlines three pathways that could lead to net zero by 2050 or sooner, but Ethiopia has not yet formally committed to a specific pathway.

Ethiopia could further advance its net zero target’s transparency, target architecture, and scope by enshrining its net zero target into a law, providing information on whether its targets cover international aviation and shipping, and communicate transparent assumptions on the use of carbon dioxide removals.

The CAT evaluates Ethiopia’s net zero target as: “Average”.

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

Ethiopia has not yet passed its net zero target in law but stated its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. This ambition includes three net zero scenarios in its Long-Term Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development Strategy (2020-2050), which was submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023.

While Ethiopia has not yet formally committed to a specific pathway for achieving net zero, the LT-LEDS develops three scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2050 or sooner. Two of the scenarios, namely the ‘NDC-aligned’ and ‘Late Action’ scenarios, aim to reach negative emissions in 2050, while the ‘Maximum Ambition’ scenario projects net zero emissions by 2035. Ethiopia considers the NDC-aligned scenario to be the most plausible pathway for achieving both its net zero target by 2050 and meeting its NDC targets.

The LT-LEDS includes details on sectoral interventions and provides sectoral emissions pathways for the three scenarios for energy, transport, agriculture and industry. While pathways are also provided for the forestry and waste sectors, the LT-LEDS could be improved by providing more clarity and contextual details on the emissions pathways for these sectors.

Ethiopia could further advance its net zero target’s transparency, target architecture, and scope by enshrining its net zero target in law, providing information on whether its targets cover international aviation and shipping, and communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals pathways.

## CAT analysis of net zero target

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Ethiopia has developed two scenarios to achieve net zero by 2050 and a more ambitious scenario aiming for net zero by 2035 in its Long-Term Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). Ethiopia plans to achieve net zero by 2050 at the latest.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Ethiopia does not provide specific information on its intention to include international aviation and shipping in its net zero target. However, it mentions the use of biofuels in aviation as one of the strategic actions in its LT-LEDS.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia’s LT-LEDS does not specify the extent of removals outside of its own borders or if it relies on international carbon credits. Therefore, interventions are assumed to be within its own borders. Ethiopia’s LT-LEDS does seem to imply that it intends to sell carbon credits. The CAT finds a very narrow scope, if at all, for countries to sell or transfer emissions reductions they may have achieved as the Paris Agreement foresees ambitious mitigation efforts progressively increasing in all countries in line with the 1.5°C limit.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Ethiopia has not yet enshrined its net zero target into law domestically, but it has expressed its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. This ambition is outlined in three net zero scenarios in its LT-LEDS which submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia outlines a decarbonisation pathway for intervention actions from 2020 to 2050, consisting of three main actions: reduced deforestation, afforestation and reforestation, and forest restoration targets. Each of these actions has its own cumulative reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Ethiopia has a non-legally binding process in place to review the LT-LEDS (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The Ministry of Planning and Development is responsible for Ethiopia’s LT-LEDS Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification and Monitoring and Evaluation, which will be improved through NDC revision cycles.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia plans to use the LULUCF sector as a net carbon sink by 2050, but does not plan to use other types of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). While the LT-LEDS stated cumulative carbon dioxide reductions/removals, there is a lack of clarity regarding the pathway figures and the annual amounts of removal.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The LT-LEDS develops scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2050 or sooner, but Ethiopia has not yet formally committed to a specific pathway. Ethiopia considers the NDC-aligned scenario to be the most plausible pathway for achieving its net zero target by 2050 and meeting its NDC targets along the way.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia considers that the updated emission reduction targets in its LT-LEDS reflect the highest possible ambition given the national circumstances, representing a fair contribution to the long-term global mitigation goal. Ethiopia also states that it cannot achieve its net zero target with only its own resources and would need support through international climate finance.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.

Ethiopia’s emissions have risen over the last decade and are expected to continue rising under current policies. Still, Ethiopia is expected to achieve its unconditional target and likely its conditional target if current policies are fully implemented.

While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are “Critically Insufficient ” when compared to what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways show should be occurring within its borders.

This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the business as usual scenario (BAU) in Ethiopia’s Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), though it is unclear what policies are comprised in the BAU scenario. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.

Ethiopia was engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed between 2020 and 2022 (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the two sides signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and drove a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. Even now, many people still suffer from malnutrition. While there has been some progress on reconstruction of affected areas, 90% of health facilities remain damaged. Manufacturing and industries have not fully recovered, with unemployment rising and workers remaining unpaid (Al Jazeera, 2023b). The progress of the reconstruction of the affected areas has been slow.

Despite this situation, Ethiopia has advanced its climate policy by publishing a Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) in 2023 (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The LT-LEDS outlines economy‑wide mitigation pathways with the aim of reaching net zero by 2050. Ethiopia’s LT-LEDS builds on its Climate Resilience and Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The LT-LEDS is stated to be aligned with the 10-Year Development Plan and the updated NDC, by adopting the economic growth projections and national objectives, and with the NDC through scenario development based on its targets.

In 2024, Ethiopia published an NDC implementation plan, which details sector-specific strategies designed to achieve the targets outlined in its NDC (Ministry of Planning and Development, 2024). This plan serves as a central national tool to enhance coordination, transparency, resource mobilisation, and the tracking and reporting of progress on the measures outlined in Ethiopia’s NDCs.

The CRGE strategy, launched in 2011, originally aimed to achieve middle income country status by 2025. CRGE is the basis of the country’s climate action. However, it faces several challenges in delivery due to the lack of representative data at national level (EfD Initiative, 2018). The government conducted an implementation review in 2020, finding no evidence of emissions reduction since the CRGE strategy was introduced (World Bank, 2020). The IEA notes that the government has made progress on monitoring and evaluation processes as well as updating the CRGE strategy (International Energy Agency, 2022a), but does not specify when the update process began. As of early 2025, no updated version of the CRGE can be found.

In early 2024, Ethiopia banned the import of all internal combustion engine cars, both new and used, becoming the first country in the world to achieve this (Hochet-Bodin, 2024). In 2022, Ethiopia introduced policy to incentive EV uptake through exempting EVs from various taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), excise tax, surtax, and a lower import tax for locally assembled EVs (EfD Initiative, 2022).

In 2023, the Government of Ethiopia secured USD 40m result-based grant from the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) (World Bank, 2023). The project aims to sequester and reduce approximately 4 MtCO2e by 2030 through various sustainable practices across the AFOLU sector.

Over the last decade, Ethiopia has prioritised the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and Koysha hydropower projects, with capacity of 6 GW and 2 GW, respectively. The GERD is expected to double Ethiopia's hydropower-based electricity generation once fully operational (Ethiopian Monitor, 2024) and it was 97.6% complete as of January 2025 (AllAfrica, 2025).

However, the GERD has been the centre of a regional dispute with Egypt and Sudan. In July 2023, the Ethiopian and Egyptian governments had agreed to fast-track negotiations to finalise the dam agreement within four months (Anna, 2023). However, by December 2023, talks collapsed, resulting in no final agreement (Reuters, 2023). As tensions persisted, Egypt brought the issue to the United Nations in July 2024 (Abdu, 2024).

While the dam potentially could provide significant benefits for Ethiopia’s low-carbon development and energy security by generating clean energy, reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the consideration of negative environmental effects and share of water resources, will be pivotal for Ethiopia in meeting its targets.

In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The plan aims to grow the economy by 10.2% annually while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and, if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan also includes emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.

Under current policy projections, we project emissions will increase to 197-220 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF); a 62-81% increase compared to 2010 emissions levels (excl. LULUCF). There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have had on emissions.


## Power sector

Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass (87.2%) (International Energy Agency, 2022b), as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022). Oil makes up the next largest share of the energy mix at 8.3%, followed by hydropower (3%), and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (International Energy Agency, 2022b). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.

However, even though Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power, only half the population has access to electricity (IRENA, 2022). In an effort to tackle this, the government introduced the National Electrification Plan (NEP) in 2017, followed by the NEP II in 2019 which aims to achieve universal electrification by 2025. This would be accomplished with 65% on-grid and 35% off-grid technologies (Ministry of Water Irrigation & Electricity, 2019). The 10-year development plan sets more ambitious targets, increasing grid-based electricity coverage from 33% to 96% and adjusting off-grid coverage from 11% to 4%. However, updated information on the status of electricity access as of 2025 is not yet available.

Low electricity access has led to only 10% of the population having access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022). As a result, Ethiopians still rely on biomass sources such as firewood and charcoal for cooking, contributing to deforestation and severe health problems due to exposure to air pollution. The National Biogas Programme is the government’s main initiative towards replacing traditional cooking fuels with more sustainable sources (Teshome, 2019).

**Hydropower**

In the 10-year development plan, the government aims to increase the export of electricity, which will require investment in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal also depends on new hydropower projects, including the GERD and the Koysha dam (6 GW and 2 GW of installed capacity, respectively) (Mpofu, 2021).

The GERD began generating electricity in 2022 (Aljazeera, 2022) and, once fully operational, the GERD is expected to double Ethiopia's hydropower-based electricity generation (Ethiopian Monitor, 2024). As of August 2024, it was 97.6% complete as of January 2025 (AllAfrica, 2025). However, the GERD has been the centre of a regional dispute between Ethiopia, and Egypt and Sudan over the Nile as a shared water resource. As tensions persisted, Egypt brought the dispute to the United Nations in July 2024 (Abdu, 2024).

While the dam provides significant benefits for Ethiopia’s low-carbon development and energy security by generating clean energy, reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the consideration of negative environmental effects and share of water resources, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets.


### Other renewable generation

In 2024, the Japanese corporation TOYO Co Ltd, announced a plan to established solar cell manufacturing factory in Ethiopia with an annual production capacity of 2GW, set to begin operations in 2025 (EnergyNews, 2024). The facility is expected to cater to the growing global demand for solar cells while also stimulating the growth of the local economy. However, its impact on the country’s solar cell adoption remains uncertain.

Ethiopia has deals with renewable energy companies based out of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to construct a 300MW wind farm (Anyango, 2024). The Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance stated that this initiative aligns with the National Energy Policy. Known as the Aysha-1 Project, the power generated by the wind farm will be sold to the national utility company, Ethiopian Electric Power, under a 25-year agreement. This project is part of the UAE's $4.5bn clean energy initiative in Africa (Irwin-Hunt, 2024).


## Agriculture

Agriculture drives the Ethiopian economy, accounting for nearly 40% of GDP, employing 80% of the workforce, and contributing 90% of the country’s foreign currency through exports (ITA, 2024). Agriculture is responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). However, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors and expected climate change induced hazards reduce an estimated 4% of the GDP (Tesfaye et al., 2024). Emissions from agriculture are expected to increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario in its LT-LEDS (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture and livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).

In 2024, Ethiopia published Climate Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) which outlines priority investment areas and strategies to enhance the agriculture sector resilience, sustainability, and productivity (Tesfaye et al., 2024). Ethiopia has been promoting climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices through the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MoANR) as a key institution, with various projects and programmes implemented by its different units including the CRGE Coordination Unit (CIAT; BFS/USAID, 2017).

The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Ethiopia’s project on CSA is focused on degraded land restoration, agroforestry, farmer managed natural regeneration, agroforestry, dissemination of improved varieties and more (International Center for Tropical Agriculture United States Agency for International Development, 2017).

However, there is a reported low level of implementation on the smallholder farmer level, due to knowledge and skills gap (Ahmed et al., 2023). Domestic and international resources are crucial to fill financial gaps (Strubenhoff, 2021). Under the NDC-aligned scenario in LT-LEDS, nearly USD 30bn in capital investment is necessary (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The CGIAR has launched the Ethiopia Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plan (CSAIP) which presents a comprehensive investment portfolio that serves as a model for practical and effective projects addressing various challenges in Ethiopia’s agricultural sector (AICCRA, 2024).


## Forestry

The CAT’s analysis based on Ethiopia’s LTS, show that Ethiopia’s emissions from LULUCF are more than 40% of the country’s total emissions, primarily as a result of deforestation. Between 2001-2022, Ethiopia lost 467 kha of tree cover. This equates to a 3.9% decrease in tree cover since 2000 and 222 MtCO2e of emissions (Global Forest Watch, 2022).

According to Ethiopia’s NDC, LULUCF is the second most significant source of emissions under BAU assumptions, after agriculture. The conditional target would see the sector become a carbon sink by 2030, reducing emissions by 171% (-240.1 MtCO2e) compared to BAU by 2030. Under the unconditional target, the sector would still be a source of emissions, but would fall by 34.6% (-48.4 MtCO2e ) compared to BAU (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia’s LT-LEDS states its low emission pathway for the forestry sector would be achieved through reduced deforestation, afforestation and reforestation, and forest restoration (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). Effective policies to ensure the achievement of these targets are crucial for significantly reducing deforestation and turning the forest into a carbon sink.

In 2018, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MEFCC) developed a National REDD+ Strategy (2016-2030) to improve management of forests and agricultural areas as a key pillar of the CRGE framework. As a result, Ethiopia has received ETB 149m (USD 3.58m) from carbon trading sold through REDD+ (Abiye, 2021).

Selling reductions from forests sinks poses a major risk for Ethiopia’s long-term mitigation ambition: achieving further mitigation reductions in the future (as needed under the Paris Agreement) will become much more difficult, and more expensive. The MEFCC also initiated the National Forest Sector Development Programme (2016-2025) to coordinate strategic policy interventions and sector-wide investments for the CRGE and REDD+ Strategy (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023).

The REDD+ Investment Programme has entered its second phase at the end of 2023, to be implemented until 2026 with a USD 25m budget from the Government of Norway. Ethiopia aims to increase total forest cover to 30% by 2030 from 15% forest cover in 2020 (UNEPGRID, n.d.).

In 2023, the Government of Ethiopia sealed a USD 40m deal with the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) (World Bank, 2023) and aims to sequester and reduce approximately 4 MtCO2e by 2030 through various sustainable practices across AFOLU sector. ISFL differs from REDD+ in both scope and governance. Scope-wise, ISFL includes the agriculture sector, addressing broader land-use challenge. Governance-wise, ISFL operates at a jurisdictional level, working directly with regional authorities rather than being limited to project-based interventions like REDD+.

The project was planned to be conducted in a three million ha area within Oromia region, where 52% Ethiopia’s forest landscapes are located. As of 2024, the ISFL program has made significant progress, including the establishment of 51 forest tree nurseries in deforestation hotspots and training over 22,800 forest users in sustainable practices (BioCarbon Fund, 2024).

In 2024, Ethiopia launched an ambitious reforestation project aimed at restoring 12,000 hectares of native forest (Green Earth, 2024). The initiative is expected to sequester 7.26 MtCO2 over 30 years. However, it has been registered under the carbon standard, indicating that the project is designed to generate carbon credits for sale in the carbon market, rather than contributing to country’s NDC.

Only 29% of Ethiopia’s total international climate finance received has gone toward addressing issues in the AFOLU sector (Padmanabhi & Meattle, 2022) despite the sector contributing to 80% of total emissions. This highlights a clear imbalance between the share of international climate finance directed to the sector and its significant contribution to national emissions.


## Waste

Ethiopia’s NDC provides ambitious targets in reducing emissions from the waste sector, although it only makes up 3% of BAU emissions in 2030. The conditional target would reduce emissions by 74.7% (-8.6 MtCO2e) compared to BAU by 2030, while the unconditional target is estimated to reduce emissions by 17.1% (-2 MtCO2e) (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

The low emissions pathway of the Ethiopian LTS aims to eliminate more than 80% of emissions from the waste sector by 2050. It includes seven actions to decarbonise the waste sector, mainly by improving solid waste collection and management. The other efforts are through organic waste treatment; landfill gas (LFG) management; inorganic/dry waste reduction, reuse, recycling and energy recovery; improved urban domestic wastewater management; improved rural and industrial wastewater management; and improved fecal sludge management (rural and urban) (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023).


## Transport

According to the LT-LEDS’ historical inventory, transportation contributed to 2.8% of Ethiopia's total emissions in 2020, although it accounted for 45% of emissions within the energy sector (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The LT-LEDS notes that these emissions mostly came from land-based transport. Road transport in particular is a major emitter, accounting for approximately 90% of total land transport emissions (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). Transport energy demand is currently met with oil, which is mostly imported.

The Ten-Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector, including increased rail infrastructure and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy that aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Electric Vehicles

Ethiopia is a regional leader for electrifying its vehicles. In early 2024, Ethiopia banned the import of all internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), both new and used, becoming the first country in the world to achieve this (Hochet-Bodin, 2024) . In 2022, Ethiopia introduced a policy to incentive EV uptake through exempting them from various taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), excise tax, surtax, and a lower import tax. The import tax is lowered to 15% for fully assembled EVs and 5% for semi-assembled ones, while CKD (completely knocked-down) vehicles—those assembled in Ethiopia—are entirely exempt from taxation (EfD Initiative, 2022).

Charging infrastructure remains one of the key barriers to widespread EV adoption (Africa Energy Portal, 2024). To address this, Ethiopia plans to install charging stations for EVs every 50 and 120 kilometres across country. The directive to establish the regulatory framework for electric vehicle charging systems has been approved (FANABC, 2025).

Ethiopia has a 10-year target to adopt 148,000 EVs and close to 50,000 electric buses by 2032 (International Trade Administration, 2024). However, after reaching its 100,000 EV target within two years, the government updated the target to 500,000 electric cars over the same period (FANABC, 2024). Ethiopia’s Transport Sector National Perspective Plan aims to decarbonise public transport by introducing 4,850 electric buses and 148,000 small electric vehicles (Ministry of Transport, 2020).

While Ethiopia has low-motorisation rate, with only one vehicle for every 100 people (International Trade Administration, 2024), Ethiopia spends over USD 5bn annually on petrol and diesel imports for transportation (FANABC, 2024). The transition to EV is expected to relieve this budget.

Public Transport and Non-motorised Transport

Ethiopia is supporting more sustainable modes of transport such as public transit and non-motorised transport. In September 2023, Ethiopia, together with Kenya, agreed to construct the an approximately 3000 km railway line connecting Lamu with Addis Ababa. The line will be electrified and the governments are currently seeking funding for the project (Preston, 2023) . The government has also supported active mobility with the Non-Motorised Transport Strategy, launched in 2020. The strategy includes the construction of 3 km of footpaths and 2 km of bike paths per 10,000 people, as well as maintaining private motor vehicle travel at 2020 levels (UNEP, 2023).


## Industry

Ethiopia’s industry sector accounts only for 1% of total emission when including LULUCF. Within the sector, the cement industry is a dominant source, responsible for nearly 100% Ethiopia’s industry sector emissions (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023), with the country being one of the top producers on the continent (AsokoInsight, n.d.). The LT-LEDS notes that mega construction projects—such as the dam, industrial parks, sugar factories, highways, railways, and private sector developments—have led to increased cement production (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023).

However, the civil war, which ended in 2023, has severely impacted industrial operations in the Tigray region, with the manufacturing, agriculture and business sectors largely destroyed and nearly 200,000 people left unemployed (Al Jazeera, 2023b). This has impacted the production of many commodities, including cement. For example, despite being one of the least damaged factories during the war, the Messebo Cement Factory was shut down and has only recently resumed operations at half capacity (Insight, n.d.; Sew, 2024).


## Methane

Around two-thirds of Ethiopia’s agriculture emissions are methane, one-third nitrous oxide and only 1% is from carbon dioxide. Methane comes from enteric fermentation and rice production, while nitrous oxide is generated from soil management, like the use of fertilisers. Manure management and biomass burning could also produce both gases (Mekonnen, 2022). Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The livestock subsector is estimated to contribute 304 MtCO2e/year from 333 MtCO2e/year of emissions from the agriculture sector by 2050, or more than 90% (excluding carbon sequestration from perennial crops) (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023).

Previously in 2016, Ethiopia had projects to reduce methane emissions from livestock, including a project for the low emission development of the dairy sector in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (Climate and Clean Air Coalition, 2016) however, there have been no recent updates on this project.

In its LT-LEDS, Ethiopia developed low emissions pathways for the agriculture sector with several mitigation interventions in line with their net zero target. The methane emissions from livestock are expected to be significantly reduced with better manure management, appropriate feeding strategies, improved animal nutrition and breeding programs, substitution of cattle to poultry, and agricultural mechanisation to reduce the reliance on animal traction. These interventions are expected to reduce emissions by 163 MtCO2e or around 54% compared to the BAU scenario by 2050, under the low emission pathway presented in LT-LEDS (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is primarily taken from the LT-LEDS inventory, covering emissions from 2000-2020 for all sectors, expressed in AR5 values without gas-by-gas separation for any sectors. These values are subsequently converted to AR4 equivalents using sector-specific gas-by-gas ratios. Specifically, we utilise PRIMAP2023 (Gütschow, 2023) as gas-by-gas ratio data for the energy, industry, waste, and agriculture. Excluding LULUCF, the time series was extended back from 2000 to 1990 using PRIMAP 2023 growth rates (Gütschow, 2023). For LULUCF emissions, we used to the Third National Communication historical inventory, as we consider government data to be the most accurate source, particularly for Ethiopia’s dominant sectors like agriculture (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2022).


## Current policy projections

The upper bound of the current policy projections uses data from the business as usual (BAU) pathway presented in the LT-LEDS, which serves to reflect the current policies, programmes, and government plans with no interventions or external mitigation actions adopted. However, it's important to note that, like historical emissions, LT-LEDS data is presented in AR5 format and lacks sector-specific gas data. We converted the data into AR4 format using gas-by-gas ratios in PRIMAP year 2022 (Gütschow, 2023) for all sectors except LULUCF, which is not included in current policies projections.

The lower bound of the current policy projections is based on emissions projections from various sources. For the energy sector, we used non-CO2 emission projections from the US EPA (EPA, 2019) and CO2 emissions projections from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) in IEA’s 2019 Africa Energy Outlook (IEA, 2022). The agricultural and waste sectors use non-CO2 emission projections from the US EPA 2019. CO2 emissions in these sectors are considered negligible. For the industry sector, we assume emissions increase at the same rate as GDP. IMF GDP growth rate projections were used for 2022-2028 and growth rates from the LT-LEDS assumed in the BAU scenario were used for 2029-2030.


## Net-zero target and other long term targets

Ethiopia's LT-LEDS outlines sectoral pathways but remains unclear regarding the waste and forestry sectors. The strategy projects that the forestry sector will achieve cumulative net emissions of -8.2 GtCO2e between 2020 and 2050, which is a notably ambitious figure that raises uncertainties about its practical implementation and the concrete role to offset emissions from other sectors. Moreover, the LT-LEDS also does not specify which pathway is most likely for LULUCF and it leads to the assumption that LULUCF emissions should counterbalance emissions from all other sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Consequently, the estimated LULUCF net sink in 2050 is derived by summing the projected emissions from all other sectors.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR). All the data sources which used AR5 are converted into AR4 equivalents using various methods that are detailed within each pathway.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business as usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component – a 14% reduction below BAU – which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.

Ethiopia has advanced its climate policy by publishing a Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) in 2023 (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The LT-LEDS has outlined long-term sustainable and resilient economy‑wide mitigation pathways aiming to reach net zero by 2050, but Ethiopia has not yet formally committed to a specific pathway.


## NDC Updates

The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.

Ethiopia submitted an updated 2030 NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).

Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business as usual (BAU) scenario, conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement on Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).

The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector in 2030. The updated 2021 NDC further indicates that the LULUCF sector would play a larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions (around 85% of total reductions).

NDC Upr criteria for assessing increased ambition, Ethiopia’s updated NDC does not reflect increased ambition. Greater reliance on the land sector for emissions reductions often indicates weaker efforts in other key sectors like energy, industry, and agriculture. Given the shift of focus, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.

The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 243 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 215 MtCO2e (see Assumptions section for details on how these figures were calculated).

*Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

- 22.07.2021 – “Ethiopia submits final updated NDC”
- 31.12.2020 – “Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear”

## CAT rating of targets

Developing countries like Ethiopia will need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a modelled domestic pathway achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Ethiopia has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional target compared to the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

Developing countries like Ethiopia will need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a modelled domestic pathway achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Ethiopia has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional target compared to the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

The “**1.5°C compatible**” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s Unconditional NDC target is consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s NDC unconditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

In June 2023, Ethiopia submitted a Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) for 2020-2050 (The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2023). The LT-LEDS outlines three pathways that could lead to net zero by 2050 or sooner, but Ethiopia has not yet formally committed to a specific pathway.

Ethiopia could further advance its net zero target’s transparency, target architecture, and scope by enshrining its net zero target in law, providing information on whether its targets cover international aviation and shipping, and communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removal pathways.
