## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Clear statement in government document on why target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 146 TWh in 2022. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (58%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 12% of total generation in 2022, from roughly 0% in 2015 (IEA, 2024a).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).


### Renewables

Renewable power, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of Argentina’s 2022 power generation, while wind and solar alone contributed around 12% (IEA, 2024a).

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).


### Nuclear

In 2022, nuclear power contributed 5% of Argentina’s total power supply (IEA, 2024a).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Summary


## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Clear statement in government document on why target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 146 TWh in 2022. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (58%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 12% of total generation in 2022, from roughly 0% in 2015 (IEA, 2024a).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).


### Renewables

Renewable power, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of Argentina’s 2022 power generation, while wind and solar alone contributed around 12% (IEA, 2024a).

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).


### Nuclear

In 2022, nuclear power contributed 5% of Argentina’s total power supply (IEA, 2024a).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

# Summary


## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 146 TWh in 2022. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (58%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 12% of total generation in 2022, from roughly 0% in 2015 (IEA, 2024a).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).


### Renewables

Renewable power, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of Argentina’s 2022 power generation, while wind and solar alone contributed around 12% (IEA, 2024a).

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).


### Nuclear

In 2022, nuclear power contributed 5% of Argentina’s total power supply (IEA, 2024a).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

# Summary


## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Clear statement in government document on why target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 147 TWh in 2024. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (54%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 14% of total generation in 2024, from roughly 0.5% in 2015 (Ember, 2025).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).


### Fossil gas

Argentina is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on fossil gas, which remains the largest source of electricity, accounting for 54% of power generation in 2024 (Ember, 2025). Over the past 25 years, fossil gas has been Argentina’s primary response to rapidly growing electricity demand. Although its share in the power mix has slightly declined in the last five year, the government has no plans to phase out fossil gas.

On the contrary, fossil gas is expected to remain central to the country’s energy strategy, with ongoing expansion plans. Currently, Argentina operates 10.4 GW of gas-fired capacity, with an additional 0.6 GW under construction and 0.7 GW planned. With Recent initiatives to expand shale gas extraction, coupled with investments in transport infrastructure and continued government subsidies, explain why Argentina continues to prioritize new gas power projects.


### Oil

Argentina is also sending **“Mixed signals”** on oil generation. The share of oil in electricity generation has fluctuated in the last five years, falling to 6% in 2024. While there are no plans to expand oil generation capacity or build new plants, there is also no formal phase-out strategy in place.

Oil is primarily used as a backup fuel during periods of peak demand or when fossil gas supplies are limited. In Argentina, supply constraints are largely due to the lack of transport infrastructure connecting production sites to power plants. Although oil-fired power generation has steadily declined over the past decade, it has again increased in recent years. However, Argentina’s gas development plans include the expansion of pipeline capacity, which is expected to reduce the reliance on fuel oil in the future (Noticias & Protagonistas, 2023).


### Renewables

Argentina is making **“Slow Progress**” on deploying renewables. While the use of renewables in power sector is on the rise, the current pace of deployment remains too slow.

In 2024, renewables, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of the country’s power generation. The share of wind and solar in electricity generaion has increased in the last five year, rising from 4% in 2019 to 14% in 2024 (Ember, 2025). However, in recent years, the focus appears to have shifted away from renewables, with growing uncertainty around future policy direction and investments in the sector.

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).


### Nuclear

In 2024, nuclear power contributed 7% of Argentina’s total power supply (Ember, 2025).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.


### Coal

While coal plays a minor role in Argentina’s power sector – accounting for just around 1% of power generation in 2024 – the government’s stance is sending **“Mixed Signals”** (Ember, 2025)**.**

Argentina currently operates one single coal-fired plant: the 375 MW San Nicolas power plant in Buenos Aires, which has been in operation since the 1990s. It is scheduled for retirement next year (Global Energy Monitor, 2025b). However, Argentina has no clear policy to fully move away from coal. The government plans to build a new 240 MW plant in Río Turbio, near existing coal mines. The project has faced repeated delays, and its final capacity remains uncertain. So far, 120 MW appears to have been connected to the grid (Global Energy Monitor, 2025a).


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

# Summary


## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Clear statement in government document on why target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 147 TWh in 2024. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (54%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 14% of total generation in 2024, from roughly 0.5% in 2015 (Ember, 2025).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).


### Fossil gas

Argentina is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on fossil gas, which remains the largest source of electricity, accounting for 54% of power generation in 2024 (Ember, 2025). Over the past 25 years, fossil gas has been Argentina’s primary response to rapidly growing electricity demand. Although its share in the power mix has slightly declined in the last five year, the government has no plans to phase out fossil gas.

On the contrary, fossil gas is expected to remain central to the country’s energy strategy, with ongoing expansion plans. Currently, Argentina operates 10.4 GW of gas-fired capacity, with an additional 0.6 GW under construction and 0.7 GW planned. With Recent initiatives to expand shale gas extraction, coupled with investments in transport infrastructure and continued government subsidies, explain why Argentina continues to prioritize new gas power projects.


### Oil

Argentina is also sending **“Mixed signals”** on oil generation. The share of oil in electricity generation has fluctuated in the last five years, falling to 6% in 2024. While there are no plans to expand oil generation capacity or build new plants, there is also no formal phase-out strategy in place.

Oil is primarily used as a backup fuel during periods of peak demand or when fossil gas supplies are limited. In Argentina, supply constraints are largely due to the lack of transport infrastructure connecting production sites to power plants. Although oil-fired power generation has steadily declined over the past decade, it has again increased in recent years. However, Argentina’s gas development plans include the expansion of pipeline capacity, which is expected to reduce the reliance on fuel oil in the future (Noticias & Protagonistas, 2023).


### Renewables

Argentina is making **“Slow Progress**” on deploying renewables. While the use of renewables in power sector is on the rise, the current pace of deployment remains too slow.

In 2024, renewables, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of the country’s power generation. The share of wind and solar in electricity generaion has increased in the last five year, rising from 4% in 2019 to 14% in 2024 (Ember, 2025). However, in recent years, the focus appears to have shifted away from renewables, with growing uncertainty around future policy direction and investments in the sector.

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).


### Nuclear

In 2024, nuclear power contributed 7% of Argentina’s total power supply (Ember, 2025).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.


### Coal

While coal plays a minor role in Argentina’s power sector – accounting for just around 1% of power generation in 2024 – the government’s stance is sending **“Mixed Signals”** (Ember, 2025)**.**

Argentina currently operates one single coal-fired plant: the 375 MW San Nicolas power plant in Buenos Aires, which has been in operation since the 1990s. It is scheduled for retirement next year (Global Energy Monitor, 2025b). However, Argentina has no clear policy to fully move away from coal. The government plans to build a new 240 MW plant in Río Turbio, near existing coal mines. The project has faced repeated delays, and its final capacity remains uncertain. So far, 120 MW appears to have been connected to the grid (Global Energy Monitor, 2025a).


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

# Summary


## Overview

**Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”.**

Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions.

Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target.

In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments:

- After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to **keep** **all existing international climate commitments**, including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets.
- **Subsidies** for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively **decrease**, including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups.
- New measures were introduced to **reform the power market**, in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment.
There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including:

- Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation.
- Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments.
- Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme.
- Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways.

To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century.

To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030.

During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies.

In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

We rate Argentina’s NDC target of “not exceeding the net emission of 349 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030” from its November 2021 updated NDC as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what they will do within their own territory.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target from November 2021 as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target, by, for example, setting separate reduction targets and clarifying its accounting methodology for LULUCF emissions. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in proposed legislation or in a policy document

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Clear statement in government document on why target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Argentina aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – In its LTS, Argentina specifies that its target covers all GHGs and all sectors of the economy (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Argentina’s net zero target is part of the LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Argentina does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Argentina provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Argentina does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Argentina’s LTS describes high-level objectives for key decarbonisation sectors (Government of Argentina, 2022a). It does not present decarbonisation pathways or establish clear policy objectives to reach its carbon neutrality target. However, as part of its LTS, Argentina did announce that it will develop such pathways and policy roadmaps in the future (Government of Argentina, 2022a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Argentina argues that its target is ambitious and fair based on its current economic situation. However, it also states that the achievement of the target will require substantial concessional international finance to achieve it.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# Policies & action

We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now lower than in our previous assessment due to an update in our projections for the agriculture sector. Newer projections expect higher agricultural and livestock production by 2030, leading to ~2% higher emissions under current policies.

Argentina’s policies and action also remain inadequate to achieve its NDC target, let alone be 1.5°C compatible. The CAT estimates that under current policies Argentina will miss its target by 54 MtCO2e. To be 1.5°C compatible, Argentina’s policies and action projections should be at least 175 MtCO2e lower in 2030.


## Policy overview

Under current policies, total emissions (excluding LULUCF) are still projected to grow significantly after 2022, namely by about 15% above 2022 levels by 2030, reaching about 405 MtCO2 in 2030 (excl. LULUCF).

In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its 2030 target. Our analysis of current policies is based on projections developed by the National University of Central Buenos Aires (UNICEN) (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). These projections include relevant policy developments up to 2022. Later developments, such as the power sector reforms, power subsidies reform and large fossil fuel investments proposed by the current government could have a significant impact on how emissions develop in the next few years, but are not yet reflected in our current emissions projections.

According to UNICEN’s modelling results, if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could almost reach its NDC target (Blanco & Keesler, 2022). This would require, reaching a carbon-free power grid by 2050, reaching 100% EV sales by 2050, and increasing energy efficiency. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would also need to speed up the achievement of those measures, plus develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation, and reduce livestock-related emissions.

UNICEN also models a carbon neutrality scenario for Argentina’s AFOLU sector. This scenario shows the sector could become carbon neutral by 2050 by increasing the GHG efficiency of livestock production by 10%, reducing synthetic fertiliser use by 90%, increasing the collection of crop residues by 25%, reducing grasslands and forests burning by 90%, reducing deforestation by 90%, and increasing both commercial forestry and forest restoration. Critically, this scenario also includes the reduction of livestock for domestic consumption ‘following the trends of the latest years in domestic consumption’ (Keesler & Blanco, 2024).

Argentina’s energy sector is its biggest source of GHG emissions, reaching 174 MtCO2eq in 2020 (54% of the total). Total energy supply increased 81% between 1990 and 2021, and fossil fuels still account for around 89%, mostly gas (50%) and oil (36%).

President Milei’s administration, which took office in December 2023, has substantially restructured Argentina’s national government, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration, and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023).

During his presidential campaign, President Milei stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government would not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). More recently, his administration stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, but the outlook looks bleak on increasing or even maintaining climate ambition in Argentina for the next four years (Spring, 2023).

The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as the fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal, both planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024).

In January 2023, the government started negotiating contracts with oil and fossil gas producers at Vaca Muerta to ensure the future pipeline will work at capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022e). In June 2023, the fossil gas pipeline was finished ahead of schedule and began operations. It is expected to carry 11 mm3/d during 2023, and to reach 22 mm3/d in 2024, which represents around 15% of the country’s current consumption (Diamante, 2023). This has the potential to prevent Argentina from meeting its climate targets through higher upstream energy emissions as well as the lock-in effects of fossil fuel infrastructure. In July 2024, a compressor plant was installed to increase the carrying capacity of the pipeline by 5 m3/d, and a second section of the pipeline is still under construction (Government of Argentina, 2024d).

During the second half of 2023 the Argentinian government produced three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023d; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It remains uncertain whether these policies will be designed and implemented by the Milei administration.

In December 2022, the government published its new National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan until 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d). This strategy was published shortly after Argentina submitted its Long-term Strategy to the UNFCCC, and reiterates both Argentina’s NDC and LTS targets, as well as expanding on many of the measures presented in Argentina’s Fourth BUR earlier in 2022. So far, the strategy seems to still be in place, but whether its implementation will continue during Milei’s administration is uncertain.

The strategy includes detailed information on Argentina’s climate measures and targets covering all major sectors. Some highlights of this strategy include targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets or measures, and it does not include any significant measures to reduce emissions from the AFOLU sector, especially from livestock.


## Power Sector

While the energy sector accounts for roughly half of GHG emissions in Argentina (200 MtCO2e in 2022), the power sector only accounts for 55 MtCO2e or 16% of the total (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Electricity generation in Argentina roughly tripled in the period 1990-2022, reaching 147 TWh in 2024. While the sector is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially fossil gas (54%), wind and solar PV have taken off in recent years, reaching almost 14% of total generation in 2024, from roughly 0.5% in 2015 (Ember, 2025).

In recent years, Argentina has shifted its energy sector development focus away from renewables and towards fossil gas and nuclear power. The Milei administration hasn’t yet given any clear communication on its development priorities for the power sector, aside from declaring an state of emergency in the power sector, announcing plans to reduce electricity subsidies and reform the power market to incentivise private sector investment (Government of Argentina, 2024b). So far, it has cut subsidies from 2% of GDP in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 mostly through policies implemented by the previous administration, with further cuts to 0.8% in 2024 (Raszewski, 2023; Tobias, 2024). Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies.

The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c).

Argentina is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on fossil gas, which remains the largest source of electricity, accounting for 54% of power generation in 2024 (Ember, 2025). Over the past 25 years, fossil gas has been Argentina’s primary response to rapidly growing electricity demand. Although its share in the power mix has slightly declined in the last five year, the government has no plans to phase out fossil gas.

On the contrary, fossil gas is expected to remain central to the country’s energy strategy, with ongoing expansion plans. Currently, Argentina operates 10.4 GW of gas-fired capacity, with an additional 0.6 GW under construction and 0.7 GW planned. With Recent initiatives to expand shale gas extraction, coupled with investments in transport infrastructure and continued government subsidies, explain why Argentina continues to prioritize new gas power projects.

Argentina is also sending **“Mixed signals”** on oil generation. The share of oil in electricity generation has fluctuated in the last five years, falling to 6% in 2024. While there are no plans to expand oil generation capacity or build new plants, there is also no formal phase-out strategy in place.

Oil is primarily used as a backup fuel during periods of peak demand or when fossil gas supplies are limited. In Argentina, supply constraints are largely due to the lack of transport infrastructure connecting production sites to power plants. Although oil-fired power generation has steadily declined over the past decade, it has again increased in recent years. However, Argentina’s gas development plans include the expansion of pipeline capacity, which is expected to reduce the reliance on fuel oil in the future (Noticias & Protagonistas, 2023).

Argentina is making **“Slow Progress**” on deploying renewables. While the use of renewables in power sector is on the rise, the current pace of deployment remains too slow.

In 2024, renewables, including large hydro, contributed roughly 30% of the country’s power generation. The share of wind and solar in electricity generaion has increased in the last five year, rising from 4% in 2019 to 14% in 2024 (Ember, 2025). However, in recent years, the focus appears to have shifted away from renewables, with growing uncertainty around future policy direction and investments in the sector.

Argentina set a target for renewable electricity generation (excluding large hydro) to reach 20% of total generation by 2025, included in Law 27.191 published in 2015 (Government of Argentina, 2015b & Government of Argentina, 2016b). However, after major policies to support the target such as the renewables auction system (RenovAr) were abandoned in 2019, it is now unclear whether Argentina will reach its target.

However, in the period up to 2030, Argentina plans to develop 2.3 GW of modern renewables on top of the current 5 GW, and 2 GW of large hydro on top of the current 10.4 GW (Government of Argentina, 2022d, 2023b; IRENA, 2023).

At the end of 2023, 74.6 MW of installed capacity were added to the grid through two wind farms and one landfill biogas plant (Government of Argentina, 2023b). A new solar park was also commissioned in July 2024, with an expected installed capacity of 200 MW and operations planned to start in 2026 (Ojeda, 2024). While these are positive steps in decarbonising Argentina’s power grid, they fall short of the pace needed. According to UNICEN’s carbon neutrality scenarios, Argentina should fully decarbonise its power sector in the 2030s (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

Under current policies, it is expected that renewables will reach approximately 25% of total power generation by 2030, with 11 GW of total installed capacity. To be on track to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality target in 2050, research suggests that Argentina should reach 25 GW of renewables installed capacity instead (Blanco & Keesler, 2022).

In 2024, nuclear power contributed 7% of Argentina’s total power supply (Ember, 2025).

In July 2022, as part of its nuclear plan, the government announced a deal with Chinese manufacturers to start the construction of a new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1.2 GW before the end of 2022 and plans for the development of an additional plant. The project will cost USD 8.3 billion and will be 85% Chinese financed (Government of Argentina, 2022b). The government also plans to retrofit at least two simple-cycle fossil gas power plants to combined-cycle to improve efficiency and add 420 MW of generation capacity (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not directly emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis, due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and the creation of nuclear waste.

While coal plays a minor role in Argentina’s power sector – accounting for just around 1% of power generation in 2024 – the government’s stance is sending **“Mixed Signals”** (Ember, 2025)**.**

Argentina currently operates one single coal-fired plant: the 375 MW San Nicolas power plant in Buenos Aires, which has been in operation since the 1990s. It is scheduled for retirement next year (Global Energy Monitor, 2025b). However, Argentina has no clear policy to fully move away from coal. The government plans to build a new 240 MW plant in Río Turbio, near existing coal mines. The project has faced repeated delays, and its final capacity remains uncertain. So far, 120 MW appears to have been connected to the grid (Global Energy Monitor, 2025a).


## Industry

In 2022, emissions from industry, including industrial processes, oil and fossil gas production and excluding indirect emissions from power consumption in industry, reached 48.4 MtCO2e in Argentina, or 14% of total GHG emissions (Government of Argentina, 2024a). In 2022, industry represented 22% of total energy demand (IEA, 2023).

The biggest subsectors by production value are food and beverage manufacturing (31%), construction (14%) and the manufacturing of chemical substances and products (12%). The industrial sector is also the biggest consumer of fossil gas after thermoelectric generation plants. However, most process-related emissions stem from steel and cement production (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

The government seeks to promote energy management systems for industrial companies. In 2018, the Ministry of Energy passed Provision 3/2018, which establishes that companies benefitting from reduced electricity prices under Resolution 1-E/2017 have to implement the ISO norm 50001 on energy management systems, including the development of an energy management action plan, energy performance targets and indicators to monitor progress (Ministry of Energy and Mining, 2018). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government reinstates its existing plans and measures for reducing energy consumption in businesses (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


### Oil and fossil gas

Argentina continues to develop its oil and gas sector, mostly focusing on increasing production in the Vaca Muerta shale fields, as well as investing in transport and export infrastructure. In 2024 both oil and fossil gas production continued to increase compared to previous years, with large contributions from Vaca Muerta.

In the first half of 2024, gas production increased 5% compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching 25,000 million cubic meters. Oil production also continues to increase, reaching 692 thousand barrels per day in May 2024 (an 8.8% increase compared to 2023), with Vaca Muerta accounting for almost 70% of the total (Ambito, 2024b, 2024a).

Major ongoing developments in the oil and fossil gas industry include:

- The construction of a new segment of the Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline (Iden, 2023; Redacción Central, 2020)
- The construction of a compressor plant in Tratayén, which increased the carrying capacity of the existing Nestor Kirchner fossil gas pipeline by 50% (Government of Argentina, 2024d)
- Development plans for the Vaca Muerta south fields (Ciruzzi, 2024)
- Plans to develop an LNG port in Rio Negro (LNGPrime, 2024)
- Agreement with Golar LNG and Pan American Energy to deploy a 2.45 mt/year Floating Liquified Natural Gas plant in Argentina to channel exports from Vaca Muerta (Enerdata, 2024)
- Offshore exploration activities off the coast of Buenos Aires failing to find fossil fuels, with some players withdrawing among decreasing interest (Terzaghi, 2024)
These developments will most likely impact total emissions in the country through increases in fugitive emissions, as well as creating lock-in of fossil infrastructure and disincentives for a deeper transformation of the energy sector. An increased dependence on internationally-traded goods can increase Argentina’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The increased production of fossil fuels could also lead to higher energy consumption. As part of its push towards domestic oil and fossil gas production, the government also plans to set out measures to reduce flaring and leakage, but so far as not provided any specific measures or targets (Government of Argentina, 2022d). Over the period 2012-2022, flaring has doubled from 600 MM3 to 1200 MM3 (GFMR, 2023).


### Hydrogen

Argentina has begun setting out plans to produce green hydrogen, both with the aim of domestic use and exports. In 2023, it set out its National Strategy for the Development of a Hydrogen Economy. This strategy sets out targets to produce 5 mt/y of “low emissions hydrogen”, which will require 30 GW of electrolysis capacity, and 55 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030. Roughly 80% of all production is expected to be exported (Government of Argentina, 2023c).

In 2022, it was announced that Australian firm Fortescue will invest USD 8.4bn in the Argentinian province of Rio Negro to develop green hydrogen. The first phase of the project will generate 650 MW and include a wind farm and a port for transportation. It will initially be destined for export, but capacity can be expanded to 8 GW in future phases, enabling the dedication of some production for the domestic market. This project fits into a provincial plan to produce 2.2 Mt by 2030 (Garcia Pastormerlo, 2021). In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also included plans to prepare a National Hydrogen Strategy with more clear milestones for Argentina’s domestic hydrogen industry (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2023, the EU also announced plans to finance the development of green hydrogen in Argentina. The original plan to invest EUR 200 million to develop green hydrogen for export to Europe is now under discussion with the current administration, who pledged to present new legislation this year to streamline processes related to hydrogen production, certification and export (Collins, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, emissions from the transport sector in Argentina represented 16% (~56 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) according to the Fifth BUR, and approximately 32% of energy demand (IEA, 2024b).

Argentina has set out policies to reduce emissions in all key areas of the transport sector, but under current policies, emissions in the sector are still expected to rise towards 2030.


### Electric vehicles

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included several targets related to electric vehicles (EVs). These include:

- The installation of over 86,000 charging stations and 2,500 fast-charging stations
- Targets to increase the sales of light- and heavy-duty hybrid and EVs to 100.000 and 150.000 respectively by 2030
- Target to replace 100% of public administration vehicles with EVs or hybrid vehicles by 2030 (around 146,000 vehicles)
- Incentivising the conversion of private vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Government of Argentina, 2022d).
The uptake of EVs remains low in Argentina, but it is now picking up due to incentive policies such as tax breaks. In 2021, the Argentinian Association of Automobile Dealerships reported 5,871 new sales of low-emissions mobility light-duty passenger vehicles, of which 99% were hybrid cars and only 1% plug-in EVs (Bloomberg Linea, 2022). In 2022, sales increased by 33%, reaching 7,849 new sales, of which 97% were hybrid and 3% pure electric (Della Vecchia, 2023). In 2023, sales reached 9601 cars in total, of which 3.7% were pure electric (Inside EVs, 2024). Overall, the low-emissions mobility market remains marginal in Argentina, with total 2023 EV and hybrid sales being under 1% of all vehicle sales (La Nación, 2023).


### Public transport

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government includes measures to support the development of rail infrastructure, including adding 83km of electric train tracks by 2026 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

Since 2008, the government has incentivised the use of public transport in large urban areas through the development of Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS). As of 2020, 18 BRTS were in place, with a goal to reach 20 by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c).


### Biofuels

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government included biofuels targets: to increase bioethanol blending to 15% in 2025, and to meet 20% of total fuel demand with biofuels by 2030. The government also plans to support second generation biofuels and aims for 2 Mt of organic waste to be used for biofuels by 2028 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

This contrasts with its current mandates to reduce biodiesel blending from 10% to 5%, with the option of being further reduced to 3% if biofuel input prices increase so much that they significantly impact final fuel prices for consumers. A recent study has calculated that this reduction can lead to a cumulative increase emissions between 7.9-11.7 MtCO2e in the period 2021–2030 compared to the previous 10% mandate (Magnasco & Caratori, 2021). However, a reduction in the production of first-gen biofuels can also have positive effects in land-related emissions, reducing the pressure to expand agricultural lands and demand for the commodities used as feedstock (Rulli et al., 2016).


### Vehicle efficiency standards and labels

In March 2021, the government also introduced a new mandatory light-duty vehicle label to reflect fuel efficiency and emissions in all new vehicles under 3,500 kg.


## Buildings

In 2020, emissions from the buildings sector in Argentina represented 8% (~27 MtCO2eq) of Argentina’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), according to its fifth BUR. They grew by 60% between 1990 and 2018, mostly through increases in electricity and heat demand from the residential buildings sector. In 2020, the sector was responsible for 47% of power demand, 23% of gas demand and 27% of total energy demand in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2023a).

In 2017, the government adopted Law 27,424 to promote the use of renewables in the building sector. This law encourages self-consumption of electricity through the introduction of net-metering (Government of Argentina, 2017). Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes targets for solar water heating in residential housing, as well as the for installation of four million square metres of solar panels in businesses by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

In 2018, the government adopted an energy efficiency labelling scheme for residential housing, aiming at improving access to information for consumers and incentivise efficiency improvements. Until 2022, this system was run by provinces, with slightly different standards being applied. Starting in 2023 the programme is handled by the national government, with the overarching aim of reaching six million households by 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2023e).

In its 2022 climate strategy, the government also lists several measures aimed at reducing energy consumption from household appliances. These measures include credit lines to upgrade fridges, heat pumps, lighting, and others. It also includes quantitative targets for specific appliances, such as 9.6 million fridges replaced by 2030, and 7.8 million heat pumps installed (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Agriculture

Agricultural emissions in Argentina were 102 MtCO2e in 2022, accounting for roughly one third of Argentina’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF), and 7% of total energy demand (Government of Argentina, 2024a). Emissions from this sector have increased by 13% over the last 10 years due to growing agricultural and livestock production.

The agricultural sector is a major economic powerhouse of the country, especially for its export market. Key commodities produced in Argentina are soybeans, wheat, maize, and cattle. In total, agricultural commodities represented 71% of Argentinian exports in 2020, and USD 38.6 billion in value. In 2022-2023 the sector was hard hit by droughts, costing the country an estimated 3% of its GDP (Reuters, 2024).

Despite the high emissions in the sector, Argentina’s national action plan for agriculture and climate change only includes three concrete measures planned for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sectors up to 2030, including afforestation (area from 1.38 million to 2 million hectares between 2018 and 2030), crop rotation (increasing the area under cereals such as wheat and maize and decreasing the area under oilseeds such as soybeans and sunflower) and biomass utilisation for energy generation, particularly for off-grid use (Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, 2019).

As part of its 2022 climate strategy, the Argentinian government has set out some additional livestock-related measures. These include a 5% increase in the GHG-efficiency of livestock until 2030 (without a clear baseline), and the promotion of silvopastoral systems through REDD+ payments. However, it remains unlikely that these measures will significantly bring down livestock-related emissions (Government of Argentina, 2022d).

A recent study analyses the potential of supply-side mitigation options to reduce emissions in the agriculture and land use sector including feed optimisation, livestock health monitoring, the use of cover crops and crop rotation, synthetic fertiliser management and the use of silvopastoral systems. It found that the combined technical mitigation potential for these measures was around 28.1 MtCO2e, or around 14% below the reference scenario in 2030. The gap to the sectoral net zero scenario, that is the amount that Argentina would need to further reduce its emissions to be on track to a net zero AFOLU sector, was of around 103 MtCO2e in 2030 (Gonzales-Zuñiga et al., 2022).

This shows the need for transformation in the sector: even when implementing best practices and increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the sectoral gap to a 1.5˚C compatible emissions pathway is very large. Argentina will need a deeper transformation of its wider food system if it is to keep its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5˚C.

Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, only to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions might be working and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. Argentina signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use during COP26.

LULUCF emissions in Argentina were around 51 MtCO2e in 2022 according to its first BTR (Government of Argentina, 2024a), accounting for ~20% of national GHG emissions. LULUCF emissions were exceptionally high in 2020 but have otherwise been on a downward trend partially thanks to the implementation of the 2007 Native Forests Law (Law 26.331). They decreased by 41% in 2020 compared to 2007 levels but remain a significant source of emissions in Argentina.

Argentina has around 54 million hectares of native forests, as well as 1.3 million hectares of cultivated forests. According to its fourth BUR, in 2018 some 187,000 hectares were lost due to the expansion of agricultural land, to forest fires, and the overexploitation of forest resources (Government of Argentina, 2022c). The government acknowledges that some of this land clearing is illegal, and that better enforcement of forestry regulations is needed. According to the Forest Declaration Assessment, deforestation in Argentina remains at high levels with 140,000 ha lost in 2023 (The forest declaration Assessment, 2024).

The Native Forests Law aims at slowing the reduction of Argentina’s native forest surface, focused on achieving net-zero deforestation. The law set minimum budgets to be spent on forest protection and established a capacity building scheme and requirements for provinces to comprehensively monitor and track forest areas. It also established the National Fund for Enriching and Conserving Native Forests that disburses funds to provinces that protect native forests (Law 26331, 2007).

As early as the late 1990s, Argentina implemented Law 25.080 to promote investments in afforestation and prevent forest degradation (Ley 25.080, 1999). According to Argentina’s fourth BUR, this law, amended by Law 26.432 in 2008, has contributed to a total of 1.3 million hectares of forest area, with a target of 1.6 million in 2030 (Government of Argentina, 2022c). However, independent sources claim that the programme has been de-funded and ecosystem services payments have been greatly decreased in real terms, and its effectiveness to continue to support afforestation and preservation is at risk (Escobar, 2021).

Alongside the implementation of its PANByCC, Argentina launched its ForestAr 2030 initiative, which aims to develop a broad stakeholder dialogue and strategy to conserve natural forests and to deliver on the country’s commitment to reducing climate change while achieving other sustainable development benefits. In the context of this initiative, the government created the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Forests through Resolution 267/2019, which seeks to restore 20 million ha of native forest per year by 2030 (Resolución 267/2019, 2019).

Recent studies show that for Argentina’s AFOLU sector to get close to carbon neutrality, the LULUCF sector would need to become a net emissions sink as fast as possible, and reach around -71 to -138 MtCO2e per year just to neutralise emissions from agriculture by 2050 (Frank et al., 2023; Keesler & Blanco, 2024). To achieve this, Argentina would need to set out stronger forestry policies, including ambitious targets and well-designed implementation and enforcement mechanisms, as well as improved coordination with subnational governments.


## Waste

Between 1990 and 2022, Argentina’s waste emissions more than doubled, accounting for 7% (23.3 MtCO2e) of Argentina’s total GHG emissions in 2020. Waste production is in the order of 1kg per person per day in Argentina (Government of Argentina, 2022c). A recent study has also shown that Argentina was home to around 100 super emitter events from waste sites in and around Buenos Aires between 2019 and 2023, reaching up to 230 tonnes of methane per hour (The Guardian, 2024).

In 2021, the Environment Ministry released Resolution 290/2021 establishing the National Programme to Strengthen the Circular Economy. This policy aims at improving waste collection and treatment systems, reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

According to Argentina’s Fourth BUR, there has been progress on segmented waste collection and treatment. Big urban centres have also implemented systems to capture and store or destroy methane from waste, while in the rest of the country, solid urban waste is still disposed of in open landfills without sanitary treatment.

Argentina’s 2022 climate strategy also includes measures and targets for the waste sector. In particular, it aims at eradicating open landfills by 2030, and to reduce food loss by 10-30% and waste by 5-10% by 2025 below 2015 levels. These targets are also part of Argentina’s National Plan for Food Loss and Waste Reduction (Government of Argentina, 2022d).


## Methane

While Argentina’s carbon emissions have almost doubled since 1990, its methane emissions have only increased moderately, reaching roughly 12% above 1990 levels in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2023a). Nevertheless, methane still accounts for 29% of all national GHG emissions in terms of global warming potential, above the global average of around 20% (Global Methane Initiative, 2022). In 2023, Argentina ranked 13th worldwide in terms of methane emissions, with most emissions coming from the agriculture sector (IEA, 2024c).

While methane is covered in Argentina’s NDC target, the NDC contains no specific targets nor actions aimed at reducing methane emissions. Current methane emissions are 100.7 MtCO2e (in AR4 GWP), with two thirds related to livestock. Argentina is one of the 95 countries that signed the methane pledge. Meeting the 30% methane reduction target would mean a 28.5 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

Historical emissions in all sectors excluding LULUCF for the period 1990–2020 as well as LULUCF emissions for 1990–2020 were taken from the national GHG inventory submitted as part of Argentina’s Fifth BUR submitted in December 2023 to the UNFCCC (Government of Argentina, 2023a). These were extended until 2022 using growth rates from PRIMAP v2.5 Final (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

NDC absolute emissions levels including LULUCF are provided directly in the NDC for the unconditional target (Government of Argentina, 2021). To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario shows that under current policies, LULUCF emissions in Argentina will steadily decrease, reaching 15.2 MtCO2e by 2030.

We also recalculate the target, that is originally communicated as an absolute number calculated using SAR GWP, to AR4 GWP. To do so, we calculate the difference in emissions between the last inventory year (2020) and the target year (2030) in SAR and apply the growth rate to the last historical value (from 2022) in AR4.


## Current policy projections

The CAT uses the projections developed by Gabriel Blanco and Daniela Keesler (UNICEN), in the report “Transición energética en la Argentina: Construyendo alternativas”, and “Escenarios 2050 para la Argentina: sector agrícola, ganadero, forestal y otros usos de la tierra” (Blanco & Keesler, 2022; Keesler & Blanco, 2024) to develop our current policy projections. These studies provide projections for all sectors based on current sectoral plans and actions in place, including the exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels as of 2022.

The UNICEN business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the power sector has the following assumptions:

- Accounts for the penetration of renewable energy in the power sector following the current trend
- Adjusts the emissions curve of the power sector to capture the current development of nuclear energy
- Accounts for barriers in the implementation of energy efficiency measures presented in the sectoral plans (buildings, industry, and transport)
- Takes into account the significant development plan for the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels (fracking and off-shore oil and gas production)
- The document does not mention the carbon tax
We apply the growth rates from the UNICEN BAU scenario for the energy, industry, and waste sectors to the 2022 historical data points for those sectors.

The agriculture sector projections have the following assumptions:

Livestock:

- An increase in the number of heads of cattle for beef, reaching almost 62 million heads by 2050, representing a 24% increase compared to the current stock, driven by the combined increase in domestic consumption and exports.
- A 10% increase in the efficiency of beef production by 2050 compared to the current 216 kg/head slaughtered.
- A 28% growth in beef exports compared to 2020 values, following the trend of international beef trade projected by OECD/FAO (2021). Although global per capita consumption is expected to decline by 5% by 2030, population growth will result in a 0.7% increase in global beef demand in the same period (OECD, 2021) .
Agriculture:

- A 14% increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by 2050 compared to the current 16.6 kg fertilizer/ton of grain, considering usage trends from the last 30 years (1990-2020).
- No change in the management of harvest residues compared to current practices.
- A 90% reduction in the burning of forests and grasslands compared to the 1,000,000 ha that are currently burned.

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Argentina committed to a net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, its long-term strategy does not include additional information on how Argentina plans to reach its target, particularly on sectoral pathways towards net zero and the expected contribution of sinks from the LULUCF sector.

The CAT uses a simplified method to estimate residual emissions under Argentina’s net zero target in 2050. The calculation is based on LULUCF projections created by UNICEN for Argentina’s AFOLU sector in their net zero AFOLU scenario (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). This scenario assumes net LULUCF emissions of -71 MtCO2e in 2050. For the simplified net zero pathway for Argentina’s economy-wide emissions, the CAT assumes residual emissions to match the LULUCF sinks of -71 MtCO2e in 2030 and assuming a linear decrease from the 2030 current policy pathways (i.e., 405 MtCO2e in 2030) to 71 MtCO2e in 2050, reaching economy-wide net zero GHG emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

In its NDC, Argentina has set an unconditional target of not exceeding 349 MtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry from this target and converts it to GWP AR4, resulting in **351** MtCO2e in 2030. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT uses a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario for the LULUCF sector developed by UNICEN (Keesler & Blanco, 2024). For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates this target as “Highly insufficient” both when compared to required domestic efforts, and when compared to Argentina’s fair share.

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

[**NOTE:** assumptions made to quantify these targets are included in the Assumptions section]


## NDC Updates

Argentina’s 2021 NDC target of 351 MtCO2e in 2030 is just a 3% reduction below the previous target submitted in December 2020, and 29% below its first NDC target. Argentina’s revised NDC covers emissions from all sectors and covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and PFCs. The country’s first NDC also covered sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

This new target represents a 9% increase in emissions above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF).

Although the new target shows a minimal increase in climate mitigation ambition, the NDC and LTS targets still need to be reflected in the short-term with concrete actions and sectoral plans, such as phasing out the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels (e.g. at the Vaca Muerta fossil gas field), eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and addressing the country’s rising emissions from the AFOLU sector, including agriculture and cattle farming.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis**

- 12.12.2020 Argentina proposed an NDC update at the Climate Ambition Summit
- 30.12.2020 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target
- 02.11.2021 Argentina submitted a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways).

Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

The CAT rates Argentina's target as "Highly insufficient" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with **modelled domestic emissions pathways**, or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its **fair share contribution** to climate action.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor.**

In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology. The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals.

Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.
