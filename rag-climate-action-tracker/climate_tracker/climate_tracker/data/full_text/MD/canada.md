# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. The Act also mandates the setting of intermediary targets at five-year intervals (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), at least a decade in advance of each target, and several reporting requirements. The first Emissions Reduction Plan with targets for 2030 was published in March 2022 and the first progress report on it in 2023 with more reports planned for 2025 and 2027 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023a).

Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow, nor does it outline the policies and measures needed to achieve the target. Reliance on LULUCF and other CDR in 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

While Canada’s Net-Zero Act includes some positive measures, it does not follow good practice identified by the Climate Action Tracker on a number of other aspects, such as including emissions from international aviation and shipping into its target nor committing to achieve the entirety of the target through emissions reductions in Canada.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Canada aims to reach net zero by 2050, however, nothing in its Net-Zero Act precludes achieving net zero emissions before 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target does not cover international aviation and shipping. However, under the Net-Zero Act, it is possible to amend the coverage in future. Although not covered officially in the Act, or in Canada’s long-term strategy, Canada’s updated Aviation action plan (September 2022) covers both domestic and international aviation emissions and Canada reported on its activities related to both domestic and international aviation and shipping as part of its first progress report under the Act.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The scenarios explored in Canada’s updated LTS focus on achieving net zero emissions through domestic action; however, Canada notes that it may use reductions or removals outside of its borders (achieved through the purchase of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes) to meet its net zero target in 2050.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Canada passed its net zero target into law in June 2021 (Government of Canada, 2021e). It submitted an updated LTS to the UNFCCC in October 2022.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Canada does not have separate emissions reduction and removal targets. It does provide information on its LULUCF assumptions and possible reliance on DACCS and BECCS in its 2022 LTS update. The LULUCF contribution is defined ex-ante and constant across all modelling approaches, whereas the extent of CO2 removal technology usage is defined by the models.
- **Review process** – Canada must prepare progress reports on its intermediary five-year targets. However, there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets, only to explain why the target was not reached and to provide a description of the actions being taken in case of failure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). We have downgraded our previous rating of this element because Canada’s Net-Zero Act does not require the review of the net zero target itself but rather the milestone targets on the way to net zero in 2050.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Canada’s long-term strategy clearly includes reliance on LULUCF and other CO2 removal technology across the scenarios it considers. The LULUCF contribution is set ex-ante and consistent across all models, whereas the level of CO2 removal technology usage varies across the scenarios. The LULUCF contribution is set at 100 MtCO2e or 15% of Canada’s 2020 emissions, while CDR usage by 2050 is as high as 34% of the country’s 2020 emissions in some scenarios.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow or outline the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target.
Under the Net-Zero Act, the government is required to set an interim reduction target for 2026. The government established this target as 20% below 2005 levels, but does not consider this to be an official target (like its NDC), just a metric to measure progress against.

In February 2021, the government established an advisory body to assist it in developing net zero pathways (Government of Canada, 2021g). The 2021 Budget included five years of funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop and apply a ‘climate lens’ to federal decision-making processes (Government of Canada, 2021b).

- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The updated LTS does not provided an explanation for why Canada’s net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Under the Net Zero Act, the government must consider Canada’s international commitments under the Convention and Paris Agreement.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 Target Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement. Canada submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 12, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

The Canadian government announced the headline ambition of its 2035 target on 12 December 2024 committing to reducing its emissions by 45–50% below 2005 levels by 2035. Canada’s 2035 target would fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. A substantial gap remains between the 2035 target, particularly for the upper part of the range, and the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and this divergence from 1.5°C MDPs in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.

The Climate Action Tracker's analysis excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target in order to keep the focus on decarbonisation of the economy (e.g. the phase-out of fossil fuels) and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimates of Canada’s LULUCF emissions and removals.

We quantify Canada’s 2035 emissions reduction target excluding LULUCF as an actual 39–55% reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 or 336–458 MtCO2e in 2035. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, Canada would need to reduce its emissions excluding LULUCF by 66% below 2005 by 2035, or to 256 MtCO2e in 2035.

As Canada has yet to formally submit its NDC to the UNFCCC, there is still time for the government to improve its NDC prior to submission:

- **Submit fixed, absolute emission reduction targets**: Canada should communicate a fixed, absolute emissions reduction target for 2035 excluding LULUCF, and align it with our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathways. The current proposed range allows Canada to meet the least ambitious end while claiming to have achieved its target. The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada’s emissions reduction target range and underlying uncertainties in the data for the LULUCF sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.
- **Update 2030 NDC target**: Canada should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The most ambitious end of the current 2030 target range of a 34−50% emissions reduction relative to 2005 levels (excluding LULUCF) is very close to the 52% cut below 2005 needed to align with a 1.5ºC compatible pathway. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada committed to increasing the ambition of its NDCs which includes its 2030 target. Updating the 2030 target could also be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets.
- **Increase transparency on use of carbon credits**: While Canada should primarily focus on its domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy, if the Canadian government does intend to use carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement then it should transparently communicate how it intends to use them and to which extent. Currently, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Rather than relying on carbon credits or unproven technologies like CCS, Canada should shift the focus to proven solutions to effectively decarbonise its economy and transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Increase provision of climate finance**: Canada should increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF). Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this newly submitted 2035 target into reality.

# Policies & action

Canada’s emissions are finally starting to trend downwards as the government continues to implement its climate policy agenda, but there remains a significant gap between current policies and Canada’s NDC target. Implementing planned policies will contribute significantly to closing that gap, but further action is needed.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”, with the latest emissions projections showing significantly lower expected emissions for 2030. That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all of the measures it has planned, it would go a long way to closing this ambition gap.


## Policy overview

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work is needed. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 377–495 MtCO2e level Canada needs to reach to meet its updated NDC target.

In March 2022, Canada released its latest climate change plan, building on earlier strategies released in 2016 and 2020 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a; Government of Canada, 2016b). The measures outlined in the plan are not yet sufficient to ensure Canada meets its NDC target, nor have all been implemented yet. It came on the heels of a damning report in November 2021 by Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development outlining 30 years of the government’s failure to meet its targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2021; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2021).

Canada is developing additional policies which are captured in our planned policies scenario. Of the major initiatives (regulations for clean electricity, post-2026 LDV model year standards, oil and gas methane target, and landfill gas), only the EV sales mandate has been implemented since the government released its 2023 projections. Our current policy projection is based on these projections and modified to include the impact of the EV sales target.

The step-up in climate action over the last four years was driven by a vulnerable minority Liberal Party government, enabled through support from the New Democratic Party. This progress risks being dialled back after the next elections, set for 2025, if the Conservatives were to come to power. They have already promised to ‘Axe the tax’, i.e. abolish the carbon pricing system. In preparation, the government has designated almost half of the CAD 15 billion (USD 11bn) in the Canada Growth Fund to be spent on Contracts for Difference or similar offtake agreements to ensure stability to investors in the coming months (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023a)

Carbon pricing

Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019 (Government of Canada, 2018a). The legislation enacting the carbon pricing scheme, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, was found to be constitutional by the country’s top court in March 2021 after three provinces challenged it (Supreme Court of Canada, 2021). A second challenge from the province of Manitoba was also dismissed by the Federal Court in October 2021.

Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities. The federal government will review its carbon pricing benchmark in 2026.

The initial carbon price of CAD 20/tCO2e was set in 2019 and increased by CAD 10 per year, reaching CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. In its latest climate plan, the government stated it will increase the carbon price by another CAD 15 per year for the 2023–2030 period, reaching CAD 170/tCO2e in 2030 (around USD 125) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021k). While the carbon price is heading in the right direction, it is still below the USD 170–290 (2015$) needed to be compatible with 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2023).

A 2022 audit of the scheme found the government had taken steps to address some of the scheme’s weaknesses, but that requirements for large emitters were poor and could be strengthened (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022a; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022a).

National GHG Offset System

In June 2022, the federal government established a GHG Offset system for activities not covered by carbon pricing (Government of Canada, 2022e). Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the OBPS. At present, the system only covers landfill methane recovery and refrigeration systems, but protocols are being prepared for forest management, livestock feed management, enhanced soil carbon, manure methane emissions and direct air carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (Government of Canada, 2022c). The ministry is also looking into ways to remove barriers and enhance participation in the system by Indigenous peoples (Government of Canada, 2022f).


## Industry

**Oil and gas production**

At over a third of total emissions, oil and gas production represents Canada’s largest source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). While the sector’s emissions dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic, they are projected to reach again 2019 levels under current policies by 2030 as production is projected to increase. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are continuing to rise, surpassing its total domestic GHG emissions, and sitting at about 939 MtCO2 in 2022 (Bernstien, 2024). This comes at a time when the IEA has called for no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement.

The government seems incapable of kicking its oil and gas addiction. It has promised to set a cap on emissions for the sector, and believes this can be achieved while increasing production. Regulations for the cap are being consulted on in 2024 and are due to be finalised in 2025. They are not yet modelled in our projections. The government is also planning to strengthen methane emission regulations in the sector (see the Methane section below) (Government of Canada, 2023b).

In April 2022, the government approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject, Bay du Nord (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022a). The project is required to be net zero from 2050 onwards, but production could continue until 2058 (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2021, 2022a). The environment and energy ministers disagree over whether this will be the last development of its kind in Canada (CBC News, 2022). Whether the project will actually proceed is unclear: the company delayed the project by three years amidst concerns over high costs, and challenges to the environmental and economic assessments continue (Canada, 2023; Federal Court of Canada, 2023; Nickel, 2023; Sierra Club, 2024).

The costs of current oil and gas expansion projects continue to rise. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, due to start operation in 2024 (Calgary Herald, 2023; Trans Mountain Corporation, 2022), is now expected to cost seven times more than when the government first purchased the pipeline (CAD 5.4 bn) (Lindsay, 2021; Williams, 2023). In June 2022, a budget watchdog concluded that it was not viable and would cost the government around CAD 600 million in net losses (Thurton, 2022). Others have estimated that losses will be much higher (The Energy Mix, 2022; Williams, 2023).

Costs associated with the pipeline for the country’s first LNG export terminal, on the country’s west coast, are also soaring (Jang, 2022; Simmons, 2022). While this pipeline is not government-owned, there are questions as to whether it will be able to recoup all of the subsidies provided (Simmons, 2022). The LNG project will only begin exporting fossil gas to Asia in 2025–2026.

Meanwhile, a new anti-greenwashing regulation is causing oil and gas industry associations to scrub their websites of unsubstantiated CCS claims (Noakes, 2024).

Net-Zero Producers Forum

Canada is part of the ‘Net Zero Producers Forum’, along with other oil and gas majors: Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US (Natural Resources Canada, 2021a; U.S. Department of Energy, 2021). The forum’s stated aim is to develop ‘pragmatic net zero emission strategies’, including reducing methane emissions and supporting the use of CCS, but it does not tackle the core issue of phasing down production. Beyond holding its first Ministerial meeting and establishing a working group in March 2022, there is little evidence of concrete action more than a year after its formation. Meanwhile, investors and international oil companies continue to exit Canada’s tar sands (Morgan, 2020; Reuters, 2021; The Canadian Press, 2020; Total, 2020; Tuttle, 2022).

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)

The province of Quebec is a member of BOGA, but Canada as a whole is not. In April 2022, Quebec passed a law banning any further production and mandated that existing drill sites be shut down within three years (Government of Quebec, 2022). The move is largely symbolic as the province is not a producer of oil and gas (Canada Energy Regulator, 2022).

**Coal mining**

In 2021, the government committed to banning thermal coal exports from and through Canada by 2030 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021b; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021b). The reference to ‘through Canada’ is important, as many American west coast miners export their coal through Canada due to resistance to developing the export infrastructure in their own country (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, 2021; Kuykendall, 2021). While establishing the ban is in the trade minister’s mandate letter, he has not yet taken action to implement it (Global Affairs Canada, 2022; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021a). On the contrary, Canadian coal exports soared in 2023, causing the opposition party to call the government to task on this issue (The Canadian Press, 2024a, 2024b).

Canada had been criticised for its hypocritical stance on coal mining, and for not subjecting a thermal coal mine expansion to a federal impact assessment, notwithstanding its position in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Rabson, 2020). In June 2021, Canada clarified its policy position on thermal coal mining, finding that any new mines or expansions of existing mines would likely cause unacceptable environmental effects (Government of Canada, 2021i). One coal mining expansion project is still attempting to get approval, with environmental groups fighting the government's decision to lift the requirement for an environmental impact assessment (Ecojustice, 2023; Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022b).


## Methane

15% of Canada’s emissions come from methane. The oil and gas sector is the largest source (48%) of Canada’s methane emissions, followed by agriculture (27%) and waste (18%) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The government has committed to reducing methane emissions from the sector by 40–45% below 2012 levels by 2025 and at least 75% by 2030, going beyond the pledges made in its 2022 national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018, 2021a, 2022d). It adopted regulations to support the 2025 target in 2018 but does not appear to be on track to achieve the 2025 goal (Government of Canada, 2018b, 2023e, 2020c, 2020a, 2020b). Additional regulations to support the 2030 goal were drafted in 2023 and are expected to be finalised in 2024 (Government of Canada, 2022k). The government is confident that they will allow it to reach and even exceed the 75% goal (Government of Canada, 2023d). We have modelled these in our planned policies scenario.

While strengthening its methane targets is a step in the right direction, emissions could be even higher than currently reported. Canada reports on emissions from the sector using bottom-up methods based on internationally agreed standards (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2021b). Research based on atmospheric measurements rather than energy statistics, suggests that emissions could be much higher (Chan et al., 2020; Liggio et al., 2019; MacKay et al., 2021). Canada made improvements to its upstream oil and gas methane emissions estimate methods in its 2022 inventory, which resulted in an upwards revision of emissions of between 31–39% over the last decade (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022e). It will continue to work to improve measuring and monitoring efforts as part of its national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26.


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions in Canada, after oil and gas, representing just under a quarter of the country’s emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). In its latest projections and progress reports, Canada foresees transport emissions reductions of 19% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b, 2023a).

Canada is taking steps to reduce transport emissions, but not at the speed needed for such a large source of the country’s emissions. A 2022 ‘action plan’ on road transport did little more than rehash existing targets, plans and funding schemes (Transport Canada, 2022a).

**Electric Vehicles**

Targets

Canada has had EV sales targets for the past several years. By 2035, 100% of new passenger car and light-duty trucks sales need to be electric vehicles, with interim targets of 20% by 2026 and 60% by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). In December 2023, the government adopted the necessary regulations to make these targets legally binding (Government of Canada, 2023g). Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are included in the definition of electric vehicles but their contribution to the sales target is capped at 20% from 2028. The sales targets increase in stringency annually, though at a slower pace in earlier years. The GHG impact of the regulations grows over time, but only contributes to minor reductions by 2030 (less than 5 MtCO2e).

In 2023, ~19% of all passenger car and truck sales were EVs, of which 8% were battery electric (Statistics Canada, 2024). Canada should easily achieve its (fairly low) 2026 interim target of 20%.

The CAT has not developed EV benchmarks for Canada; however, our US benchmark suggests that Canada’s targets are not 1.5°C compatible: 95–100% of all US passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in 2030 should be zero emission vehicles.

The government aims to electrify its own light-duty vehicles LDV fleet by 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a).

Medium and heavy-duty vehicles

Canada has also set targets for its medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) with the goal of achieving a 35% sales target by 2030 and 100% by 2040 for some models (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). Stakeholder consultation on the regulations to make these targets binding has begun, but the timeline for their adoption is not clear (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a).

Infrastructure and support programmes

The government began supporting the development of EV-related infrastructure and charging networks in 2016 (Natural Resources Canada, 2021b, 2021c, 2023). Canada has about 26,000 chargers at 10,000 locations across the country (Natural Resources Canada, 2024). Analysis suggests that Canada will need between 440,000-470,000 chargers in 2035 to support its 100% sales target (Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, 2022).

The government missed an opportunity to support residential charging infrastructure by not including them in the most recent building codes, though some municipalities are taking action (Kozelj, 2024). Making buildings EV-charger-ready through minor changes at the time of construction can significantly reduce the costs when the necessary equipment is actually installed (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

Since 2019, the federal government has provided rebates for the purchase or lease of EVs and will continue to do so until March 2025 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Transport Canada, 2022b). In July 2022, it launched a four-year, half billion CAD programme to support the purchase of medium and heavy duty electric vehicles (Transport Canada, 2022c).

**Vehicle emission standards**

Canadian fuel economy standards for light and heavy-duty vehicles are aligned with federal-level regulations in the US (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021h, 2018c). The Biden administration has been working on reversing the Trump era rollbacks, adopting new rules for emissions and fuel standards (see US assessment for details). GHG standards for new trailers have been delayed for several years in response to legal challenges to those standards in the US.

**Fuel standards**

In July 2023, the Clean Fuel Regulations finally took effect, though are unlikely to have much of an impact until 2025 (Bakx, 2023; Government of Canada, 2022p). The regulations require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels from 2016 levels, with increasing annual reductions through to 2030.

The regulations create a credit market for compliance, which allows those not subject to the regulations (like EV charging stations or low carbon fuel producers (e.g. biofuels)) to participate. The regulations aim to improve production processes in the oil and gas sector, foster production of low carbon fuels and enable end-use fuel switching in transport. The fuels used by remote communities, and in international shipping, and domestic and international aviation are exempt from the regulation. The renewable fuel content requirements, 2% for diesel and 5% for gasoline, as set out in the Renewable Fuels Regulations, have been incorporated in these new regulations (Government of Canada, 2010).

These regulations were first proposed in 2016 as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016a). Originally, standards were also supposed to be prepared for gaseous and solid fuels; however, these were delayed due to industry concerns over trade impacts and have since been shelved (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2017).

**Aviation**

Canada lacks effective policies to address its aviation emissions, which stand at 22 MtCO2e in 2019. Most of these emissions are not covered by its carbon pricing system, as this pertains to interprovincial travel only, and its clean fuel regulations (see above) do not extend to jet fuel. 70% of Canada’s aviation emissions are from international flights (Government of Canada, 2022b).

In 2022, Canada updated its aviation action plan (Government of Canada, 2022b). As part of the plan, the government commits to exploring ways to consistently apply carbon pricing to domestic aviation emissions.

The plan charts a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in which a shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is responsible for close to half of the needed reductions. In combination with increased efficiency in equipment and operations, this would offset the expected growth in air travel and bring emissions back to their 2005 levels (around 12 MtCO2e). These residual emissions would then need to be balanced by negative emissions, such as direct air capture. Around 70% of fuel used in 2050 would be SAF with a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower lifecycle emissions would increase the need for negative emissions outside the sector.

Canada does not produce commercially relevant amounts of SAF currently. In 2023, the airline industry produced a SAF roadmap which is considered an integral part of the government’s aviation action plan. The roadmap charts the requirements for this nascent technology to be able to grow to 25% fuel share by 2035. The roadmap assumes around 50% lifecycle emissions savings in SAF in contrast to the 90% reduction in the aviation plan.

Notably, the aviation plan’s four emission reduction measures are all targeting emission reductions per flight, rather than reducing the number of flights by making other transport modes more attractive. The plan only mentions a new highspeed rail network to connect the airports, rather than incentives to shift travel to rail connections to central stations in the major cities (Government of Canada, 2022b).


## Buildings

A little over a tenth of Canada’s emissions are from the buildings sector (excluding electricity) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Under the climate plan, the government hopes to cut emissions from the sector by 37% below 2005 levels, by 2030, yet emissions have stagnated since 2005 and the last progress report’s NDC-compatible scenario shows 25% of reductions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023b, 2023a). Provinces, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over building regulations; however, there is much the federal government can still do to provide direction and support.

The federal government has been active in four key areas under the 2016 Pan Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016b):

1) Creation of a ‘net-zero energy ready’ building code for new buildings,

2) programmes to encourage retrofits and fuel switch in existing buildings,

3) energy efficiency labelling, and

4) standards and renovation programmes in Indigenous communities.

Building on this framework, the government held a consultation in 2022 on a new Green Buildings Strategy aligned with the overall 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (Government of Canada, 2021j; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). The three main goals under the strategy are

1) all new buildings to be net-zero carbon ready by 2032 latest,

2) deep retrofit rate to increase to 3–5% per year by 2025,

3) transitioning from fossil-fuel based to electric water and space heating systems.

The Strategy was scheduled for release in 2023 but appears to be delayed.

The new building codes were adopted in 2022, after a two year delay (but are referred to as the ‘2020’ codes) (National Research Council Canada, 2020, 2022a, 2022b). They adopted a tiered system for the first time, which includes a ‘net zero energy ready’ level. (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready.

Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022). While the codes are heading in the right direction, they are missing key elements: there are no GHG emission requirements, nor provisions to support renewable or EV readiness, though GHG emissions will be addressed in the next update cycle (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b).

As 80% of the buildings stock that will exist in 2030 has already been built (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a), accelerating energy-efficient renovations and retrofits is crucial to decarbonising the sector. Canada has several programmes which support its goal of a 3–5% deep retrofit rate, including CAD 200m for a Deep Retrofit Accelerator Initiative for large buildings (Natural Resources Canada, n.d.), but additional measures are likely needed to achieve this goal. While we have not undertaken this analysis for Canada, the CAT estimates the USA and the EU would need to renovate at least 3.5% of the existing buildings stock per year to be compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit.

The government has also been slowly updating its energy efficiency regulations for a number of residential and commercial products (water heaters, furnaces, etc) and is planning a further round of revisions (Government of Canada, 2022l, 2019c, 2019b). Often the regulatory updates seek to align with existing standards in the USA. As part of the Green Buildings Strategy, it will adopt regulations to prohibit the installation of new oil or fossil gas heating systems and will develop incentives to accelerate heat pump adoption.


## Power

Electricity generation is responsible for less than 10% of Canada’s emissions. Its share of the country’s emissions has been falling since 2015 as Canada shifts away from coal (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b). The government has committed to achieving a net zero emissions grid by 2035 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021a). Draft regulations were issued in August 2023, but will not be adopted until 2024 (Government of Canada, 2023a).

To be 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

**Coal power phase out – almost, but not quite**

Canada co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 to help accelerate the rapid phase-out of “unabated” coal-fired electricity. It has had a regulatory system in place since 2018 to phase out “unabated” coal power by 2030 and is on track to achieve this phase-out. However, this regulation still allows plants which emit up to 420 gCO2/kWh, i.e. roughly half the emissions intensity of conventional coal power (Government of Canada, 2018d). Currently only three of its ten provinces still generate power from coal (Natural Resources Canada, 2023b). Alberta (Severson-Baker, 2024).

While these developments are positive, they fall short of the 1.5°C benchmark. The CAT does not see a role for coal power with CCS for three main reasons:

- CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants
- Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.
- The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives
Since 2014, Canada has had one coal-fired power plant equipped with CCS in operation (Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam), but it has been plagued with technical and operational problems and has still not met its annual CO2 capture target (Rives, 2022; SaskPower, 2022b, 2022a; Schlissel, 2021; Taylor, 2019).

**Fossil gas power phase-out**

To achieve its goal of a (net) zero emissions grid, the government proposed new Clean Electricity Regulations in 2023 to streamline and strengthen emissions performance standards for all fossil-generated electricity above 25 MW capacity (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a, 2018e).

These regulations will replace the coal and fossil gas regulations when they come into force in 2035. They will apply different rules to older plants (in operation before 2021) and newer plants (commissioned in or after 2021). For newer plants, any emissions that occur after 2035 would need to be offset or will be subject to the federal carbon price (which will be a minimum of CAD 170/tCO2e by that time). Exemptions will apply in cases of emergencies, when fossil gas without CCS may be used, and for remote northern communities (where much of the power is diesel generated). For older facilities, only emissions that exceed the sector benchmark of 370 gCO2/kWh need to be offset.

The regulations may also provide flexibility for newer fossil gas units built prior to 2025, which would be allowed to continue to operate ‘for a short prescribed period’ after 2035 (Government of Canada, 2022j). Cascade Power, a 900 MW fossil gas plant, due to start operation in 2024 could fall under such exception (Cascade Power, 2021). SaskPower is also building new fossil gas plants to come online in 2024–2026 (SaskPower, 2022a).

While the commitment to decarbonise its power sector by 2035 is a positive step, the extent to which Canada continues to build and rely on fossil gas is concerning, especially given that the cost of fossil gas is expected to increase further, while renewable electricity generation continues to get cheaper.

**Renewables**

Two-thirds of Canada’s electricity is already renewable, due to a long legacy of hydropower that still supplies 60% of demand. Solar and wind power are increasing fast, having grown from 2% to 7% market share in the last decade. Another 15% is nuclear power, leaving less than 20% to be supplied from fossil sources (IEA, 2023). Despite this strong starting position for achieving an early carbon-free grid, under current policy, Canada is expected to use gas for power generation beyond 2030, betting on CCS to deliver on its promise of a net-zero emissions grid by 2035.

Canada has several funding programmes for ‘clean electricity’ projects, including renewables, nuclear and CCS-projects as well as programmes to fund storage and grid strengthening (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

**Hydrogen**

Canada released its Hydrogen Strategy in 2020 (Natural Resources Canada, 2020). It sees the shift to hydrogen as a key contributor in meeting both its 2030 NDC and net zero goals. The Strategy estimates that Canada could reduce emissions by 22–45 MtCO2e by 2030, representing 15% of total reductions, by supplying 6% of final demand, primarily in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050 it foresees savings of 90–190 MtCO2e through the use of hydrogen representing 26% of total reductions, by supplying 30% of final demand. The Strategy is not limited to green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy only), but includes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS.

In contrast, Canada’s latest climate plan only includes a 15 MtCO2e reduction from hydrogen use by 2030. As much of the hydrogen would be produced using fossil gas, an additional 30 MtCO2e of CCUS capacity would be needed to capture the associated emissions (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). For comparison, Canada’s only commercial CCS abated coal-fired power plant in operation was designed to capture 1 MtCO2e and has not yet achieved this target (see above for details).

Canada’s Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development has heavily criticised the estimates in the Hydrogen Strategy, finding the underlying assumptions on policy implementation and price development ‘unrealistic’ (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022b; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). One example is the assumption that a blending level of 7.3% can be achieved in the medium term: In the absence of blending obligations for 2030 a carbon price of at least CAD 500/tCO2, rather than the anticipated CAD 170/tCO2, would be required to achieve this.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has reinforced the need for securing green hydrogen production and supply. In August 2022, Canada and Germany established a Hydrogen Alliance through which Canada would aim to start exporting hydrogen to Germany in 2025 (Government of Canada & Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, 2022).


## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for around 8% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The sector is projected to contribute around 4% of the emissions reductions in its latest 2030 climate plan. While the sector is responsible for 27% of the country’s methane emissions, it will contribute only about 1% of the reductions under Canada’s methane plan. Policy action is a mix of cross-cutting measures, individual targets and programmes and funding initiatives.

In 2020 Canada announced a voluntary target of reducing emissions from fertiliser use by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, a key source of N2O emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a). Direct emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertiliser have increased substantially since 2005. The government concluded consultations on the approaches to achieve the target in August 2022, but has not yet announced the next steps (Government of Canada, 2022c, 2022m, 2022n).

Some agricultural activities will be eligible for the federal government’s GHG offset system, established in June 2022. Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS). Protocols for projects related to livestock feed management and enhancing soil organic carbon are currently being developed and ones for manure management and anaerobic digestions are planned (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d; Government of Canada, 2022c).

Health Canada for the first time did not include a meat category, instead choosing to focus on “protein foods” (Government of Canada, 2019a; Health Canada, 2019). It also recommends choosing plant-based protein more often than other sources. Reducing emissions from agriculture, including through shifting the system to a more plant-based diet, will be key to meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions accounted for around 3% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022, but 18% of the country’s methane emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Municipal landfills are the primary source of emissions. Efforts to reduce methane emissions to date have only been able to balance out the increased waste generated from a growing population and thus current methane levels from landfills are at about the same level as 20 years ago (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada anticipates cutting methane emissions from the waste sector by 45% between 2020 and 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d). The government issued draft new regulations for consultation in 2023; final regulations are expected in 2024 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b; Government of Canada, 2023d).

In June 2022, the government finalised the details around generating offset credits from landfill methane recovery and destruction projects (Government of Canada, 2022j). These credits can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS).

The Food Waste Reduction Challenge (discussed in the agriculture section) will also contribute to avoiding emissions in the sector.


## Forestry

Canada’s vast forests have historically been both a source and a sink of emissions, officially contributing a small source in recent years. However, forest fires, and other disturbances like insect outbreaks, are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting. If these disturbances had been considered in 2018, for example, they would have added another 200 MtCO2e to Canada’s emissions, more than a quarter of the country’s reported total (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Forest fires are intensifying across the country, with 2023 setting a tragic record: 16.5 Mha of land were burnt, an area larger than the country of Greece and over double the previous record from 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023a).

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c). According to its most recent inventory of 2024, Canada’s forests have never been a net sink. Canada will need significantly more action in this sector if it is to achieve such a large sink.

**Two Billion Trees**

Canada has a number of initiatives to support nature-based solutions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a). Its flagship plan, finally launched in 2021, is to plant two billion trees during the 2020s (Government of Canada, 2021a; Liberal Party of Canada, 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2021c).

In April 2023, the country’s Auditor General expressed concern over the slow rollout of the plan, concluding that the two billion target would not be met without significant changes (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). The government contends that it is now back on-track (Natural Resources Canada, 2023e), yet the programme’s website still lacks basic tree planting information (how many planned versus actually planted) or any information about GHG sequestration.

The programme was designed to sequester up to 2 MtCO2e by 2030 and up to 11–12 MtCO2e by 2050, but the auditors concluded that it will be a tiny net source of emissions (0.1 MtCO2e) to 2030, due to emissions from planting activities and site preparation, and only sequester 4.3 MtCO2e in 2050 (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Even if achieved, these emission reductions may be at least partially cancelled out by emissions from forest fires, given that several projects under the programme are used to reforest areas lost to recent wildfires (Natural Resources Canada, 2023c).

For context, Canada intends to rely on 12 MtCO2e of sequestration towards in 2030 in its base case, which includes this programme, and up to 27 MtCO2e with additional programmes.

**GHG Offset System**

Afforestation projects are not yet eligible to register credits under the federal GHG Offset system, but the government has considered allowing this in future (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020b; Government of Canada, 2021f). If projects under the two billion trees initiative were eligible, this could open the door to double-counting of emissions reductions across the two systems.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is from Canada’s national GHG inventory and covers the period to 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024).


## NDC and other targets

**NDC**

We calculate a 40-45% reduction from base year emissions (2005) excluding LULUCF and then subtract the projected LULUCF contribution in 2030. That LULUCF contribution ranges from our own estimates based on the trend over the last decade (up to 35 MtCO2e source) at one end, to the values in the government’s 2023 emissions projections (up to -45 MtCO2e sink in the additional measures scenario) at the other end. These government estimated sink contributions are higher than the government’s previous estimates of -12 to -27 MtCO2e in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a).

The reason that we added our own estimates to the LULUCF contribution is that in the 2024 inventory, Canada revised its approach to LULUCF, making it an overall source rather than sink. However, the 2023 projections still take the former approach, meaning there is an inconsistency between the government’s projection and the inventory until the new projections are published. Hence, we added our own simplified estimates and show a range within which the actually expected values might likely fall.

Canada is still considering the extent to which it will rely on international carbon market credits (‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’ or ITMOs), however, it did indicate that it may use credits obtained under the Western Climate Initiative (a regional carbon market between some Canadian provinces and American states) for compliance with its 2030 target in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a). In its latest emissions projection report, that estimate for 2030 is 0.6 MtCO2e (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

We have added these potential credits to the NDC values we rate against modelled domestic pathways (i.e. the reductions that Canada should achieve within its borders), but subtract them in the NDC value we rate against the country’s fair share allocation.


## Current policy projections

Our current policy projection is based on the ‘Reference Case’, which is updated annually by the Government of Canada, harmonised to the last historical year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

The projections include policy measures in place as of August 2023. In December 2023, Canada adopted its EV sales mandate regulations. We have adjusted our current policy projection to reflect this change. Beyond that change, we consider the current policy projection to be an accurate picture of the policy landscape as of January 2024.

The EV sales mandate adjustment is based on the estimated impact of the measure as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement and the difference between the reference and with additional measures scenario (Government of Canada, 2023e).

We do not include any contribution from LULUCF or market credits from the Western Climate Initiative in our estimates.


## Planned policy projections

Our planned policy projection is based on the ‘with additional measures’ scenario provided by the government in its annual projections data, harmonised to the last historical emissions year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

In our last assessment, we excluded emissions reductions associated with hydrogen given the concerns of Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development over the validity of the modeling associated with those estimates (see the hydrogen section in the current policies tab for more details). The government has revised its assumptions for the impact of its hydrogen strategy downwards in its latest projection, so we no longer consider it necessary to make any adjustments to this pathway. Previously, the government had been assuming that 7.5% of blended marketable fossil gas would be from hydrogen, which has been revised down to 0.45%.

Note – Our COP28 global temperature update was based on data from Canada’s Fifth Biennial Report, harmonised to the latest historical emissions and included the adjustment for the reduced impact of the hydrogen strategy.


## Net zero target and other long-term targets

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target. We use this value for the residual emissions in their net zero target excluding LULUCF (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c).


## Global warming potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Targets Overview

Canada aims to cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030. It submitted a stronger target in 2021, but did not revise its target further in 2022, contrary to what it agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada‘s NDC and uncertainties in the data for the sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.

Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).

Under its domestic climate legislation, Canada is required to set its 2035 target by 1 December 2024.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022.


## NDC Updates

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021c). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 377-494 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded. This is around 20 MtCO2e higher than our previous estimate as Canada has increased its expected (emissions-reducing) contribution from the land sector and updated its historical emissions. The range has also widened due to the significant change to land sector emissions in Canada’s 2024 inventory which casts doubts on the possibility of this sector contributing the envisaged larger-scale emissions reductions in Canada’s climate plan.

The focus of Canada’s emissions reduction target is on cutting emissions domestically; however, in its NDC submission, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Canada is working on its policy towards international carbon credits (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

* Includes market credits of 0.6 MtCO2e. Note that due to the uncertainty on the LULUCF contribution to achieving the target, we rate the middle of the uncertainty range around the 40% reduction target, which is estimated at ~455 MtCO2e

** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target. We are showing how it would have been rating under our current system for the sake of comparability.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- 12.07. 2021 – Canada submits its updated NDC
- 22.04. 2021 – Canada announces a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO2e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric.

The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”).

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling.

We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance.

Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.”

In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess.

Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020.

Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely.

At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023)

To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.


## Net Zero target and other long-term targets

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. The Act also mandates the setting of intermediary targets at five-year intervals (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), at least a decade in advance of each target, and several reporting requirements. The first Emissions Reduction Plan with targets for 2030 was published in March 2022 and the first progress report on it in 2023 with more reports planned for 2025 and 2027 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023a).

Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow, nor does it outline the policies and measures needed to achieve the target. Reliance on LULUCF and other CDR in 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

While Canada’s Net-Zero Act includes some positive measures, it does not follow good practice identified by the Climate Action Tracker on a number of other aspects, such as including emissions from international aviation and shipping into its target nor committing to achieve the entirety of the target through emissions reductions in Canada.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Canada aims to reach net zero by 2050, however, nothing in its Net-Zero Act precludes achieving net zero emissions before 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target does not cover international aviation and shipping. However, under the Net-Zero Act, it is possible to amend the coverage in future. Although not covered officially in the Act, or in Canada’s long-term strategy, Canada’s updated Aviation action plan (September 2022) covers both domestic and international aviation emissions and Canada reported on its activities related to both domestic and international aviation and shipping as part of its first progress report under the Act.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The scenarios explored in Canada’s updated LTS focus on achieving net zero emissions through domestic action; however, Canada notes that it may use reductions or removals outside of its borders (achieved through the purchase of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes) to meet its net zero target in 2050.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Canada passed its net zero target into law in June 2021 (Government of Canada, 2021e). It submitted an updated LTS to the UNFCCC in October 2022.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Canada does not have separate emissions reduction and removal targets. It does provide information on its LULUCF assumptions and possible reliance on DACCS and BECCS in its 2022 LTS update. The LULUCF contribution is defined ex-ante and constant across all modelling approaches, whereas the extent of CO2 removal technology usage is defined by the models.
- **Review process** – Canada must prepare progress reports on its intermediary five-year targets. However, there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets, only to explain why the target was not reached and to provide a description of the actions being taken in case of failure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). We have downgraded our previous rating of this element because Canada’s Net-Zero Act does not require the review of the net zero target itself but rather the milestone targets on the way to net zero in 2050.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Canada’s long-term strategy clearly includes reliance on LULUCF and other CO2 removal technology across the scenarios it considers. The LULUCF contribution is set ex-ante and consistent across all models, whereas the level of CO2 removal technology usage varies across the scenarios. The LULUCF contribution is set at 100 MtCO2e or 15% of Canada’s 2020 emissions, while CDR usage by 2050 is as high as 34% of the country’s 2020 emissions in some scenarios.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow or outline the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target.
Under the Net-Zero Act, the government is required to set an interim reduction target for 2026. The government established this target as 20% below 2005 levels, but does not consider this to be an official target (like its NDC), just a metric to measure progress against.

In February 2021, the government established an advisory body to assist it in developing net zero pathways (Government of Canada, 2021g). The 2021 Budget included five years of funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop and apply a ‘climate lens’ to federal decision-making processes (Government of Canada, 2021b).

- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The updated LTS does not provided an explanation for why Canada’s net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Under the Net Zero Act, the government must consider Canada’s international commitments under the Convention and Paris Agreement.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 Target Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement. Canada submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 12, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

The Canadian government announced the headline ambition of its 2035 target on 12 December 2024 committing to reducing its emissions by 45–50% below 2005 levels by 2035. Canada’s 2035 target would fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. A substantial gap remains between the 2035 target, particularly for the upper part of the range, and the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and this divergence from 1.5°C MDPs in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.

The Climate Action Tracker's analysis excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target in order to keep the focus on decarbonisation of the economy (e.g. the phase-out of fossil fuels) and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimates of Canada’s LULUCF emissions and removals.

We quantify Canada’s 2035 emissions reduction target excluding LULUCF as an actual 39–55% reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 or 336–458 MtCO2e in 2035. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, Canada would need to reduce its emissions excluding LULUCF by 66% below 2005 by 2035, or to 256 MtCO2e in 2035.

As Canada has yet to formally submit its NDC to the UNFCCC, there is still time for the government to improve its NDC prior to submission:

- **Submit fixed, absolute emission reduction targets**: Canada should communicate a fixed, absolute emissions reduction target for 2035 excluding LULUCF, and align it with our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathways. The current proposed range allows Canada to meet the least ambitious end while claiming to have achieved its target. The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada’s emissions reduction target range and underlying uncertainties in the data for the LULUCF sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.
- **Update 2030 NDC target**: Canada should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The most ambitious end of the current 2030 target range of a 34−50% emissions reduction relative to 2005 levels (excluding LULUCF) is very close to the 52% cut below 2005 needed to align with a 1.5ºC compatible pathway. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada committed to increasing the ambition of its NDCs which includes its 2030 target. Updating the 2030 target could also be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets.
- **Increase transparency on use of carbon credits**: While Canada should primarily focus on its domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy, if the Canadian government does intend to use carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement then it should transparently communicate how it intends to use them and to which extent. Currently, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Rather than relying on carbon credits or unproven technologies like CCS, Canada should shift the focus to proven solutions to effectively decarbonise its economy and transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Increase provision of climate finance**: Canada should increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF). Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this newly submitted 2035 target into reality.

# Policies & action

Canada’s emissions are finally starting to trend downwards as the government continues to implement its climate policy agenda, but there remains a significant gap between current policies and Canada’s NDC target. Implementing planned policies will contribute significantly to closing that gap, but further action is needed.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”, with the latest emissions projections showing significantly lower expected emissions for 2030. That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all of the measures it has planned, it would go a long way to closing this ambition gap.


## Policy overview

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work is needed. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 377–495 MtCO2e level Canada needs to reach to meet its updated NDC target.

In March 2022, Canada released its latest climate change plan, building on earlier strategies released in 2016 and 2020 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a; Government of Canada, 2016b). The measures outlined in the plan are not yet sufficient to ensure Canada meets its NDC target, nor have all been implemented yet. It came on the heels of a damning report in November 2021 by Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development outlining 30 years of the government’s failure to meet its targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2021; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2021).

Canada is developing additional policies which are captured in our planned policies scenario. Of the major initiatives (regulations for clean electricity, post-2026 LDV model year standards, oil and gas methane target, and landfill gas), only the EV sales mandate has been implemented since the government released its 2023 projections. Our current policy projection is based on these projections and modified to include the impact of the EV sales target.

The step-up in climate action over the last four years was driven by a vulnerable minority Liberal Party government, enabled through support from the New Democratic Party. This progress risks being dialled back after the next elections, set for 2025, if the Conservatives were to come to power. They have already promised to ‘Axe the tax’, i.e. abolish the carbon pricing system. In preparation, the government has designated almost half of the CAD 15 billion (USD 11bn) in the Canada Growth Fund to be spent on Contracts for Difference or similar offtake agreements to ensure stability to investors in the coming months (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023a)

Carbon pricing

Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019 (Government of Canada, 2018a). The legislation enacting the carbon pricing scheme, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, was found to be constitutional by the country’s top court in March 2021 after three provinces challenged it (Supreme Court of Canada, 2021). A second challenge from the province of Manitoba was also dismissed by the Federal Court in October 2021.

Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities. The federal government will review its carbon pricing benchmark in 2026.

The initial carbon price of CAD 20/tCO2e was set in 2019 and increased by CAD 10 per year, reaching CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. In its latest climate plan, the government stated it will increase the carbon price by another CAD 15 per year for the 2023–2030 period, reaching CAD 170/tCO2e in 2030 (around USD 125) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021k). While the carbon price is heading in the right direction, it is still below the USD 170–290 (2015$) needed to be compatible with 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2023).

A 2022 audit of the scheme found the government had taken steps to address some of the scheme’s weaknesses, but that requirements for large emitters were poor and could be strengthened (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022a; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022a).

National GHG Offset System

In June 2022, the federal government established a GHG Offset system for activities not covered by carbon pricing (Government of Canada, 2022e). Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the OBPS. At present, the system only covers landfill methane recovery and refrigeration systems, but protocols are being prepared for forest management, livestock feed management, enhanced soil carbon, manure methane emissions and direct air carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (Government of Canada, 2022c). The ministry is also looking into ways to remove barriers and enhance participation in the system by Indigenous peoples (Government of Canada, 2022f).


## Industry

**Oil and gas production**

At over a third of total emissions, oil and gas production represents Canada’s largest source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). While the sector’s emissions dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic, they are projected to reach again 2019 levels under current policies by 2030 as production is projected to increase. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are continuing to rise, surpassing its total domestic GHG emissions, and sitting at about 939 MtCO2 in 2022 (Bernstien, 2024). This comes at a time when the IEA has called for no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement.

The government seems incapable of kicking its oil and gas addiction. It has promised to set a cap on emissions for the sector, and believes this can be achieved while increasing production. Regulations for the cap are being consulted on in 2024 and are due to be finalised in 2025. They are not yet modelled in our projections. The government is also planning to strengthen methane emission regulations in the sector (see the Methane section below) (Government of Canada, 2023b).

In April 2022, the government approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject, Bay du Nord (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022a). The project is required to be net zero from 2050 onwards, but production could continue until 2058 (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2021, 2022a). The environment and energy ministers disagree over whether this will be the last development of its kind in Canada (CBC News, 2022). Whether the project will actually proceed is unclear: the company delayed the project by three years amidst concerns over high costs, and challenges to the environmental and economic assessments continue (Canada, 2023; Federal Court of Canada, 2023; Nickel, 2023; Sierra Club, 2024).

The costs of current oil and gas expansion projects continue to rise. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, due to start operation in 2024 (Calgary Herald, 2023; Trans Mountain Corporation, 2022), is now expected to cost seven times more than when the government first purchased the pipeline (CAD 5.4 bn) (Lindsay, 2021; Williams, 2023). In June 2022, a budget watchdog concluded that it was not viable and would cost the government around CAD 600 million in net losses (Thurton, 2022). Others have estimated that losses will be much higher (The Energy Mix, 2022; Williams, 2023).

Costs associated with the pipeline for the country’s first LNG export terminal, on the country’s west coast, are also soaring (Jang, 2022; Simmons, 2022). While this pipeline is not government-owned, there are questions as to whether it will be able to recoup all of the subsidies provided (Simmons, 2022). The LNG project will only begin exporting fossil gas to Asia in 2025–2026.

Meanwhile, a new anti-greenwashing regulation is causing oil and gas industry associations to scrub their websites of unsubstantiated CCS claims (Noakes, 2024).

Net-Zero Producers Forum

Canada is part of the ‘Net Zero Producers Forum’, along with other oil and gas majors: Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US (Natural Resources Canada, 2021a; U.S. Department of Energy, 2021). The forum’s stated aim is to develop ‘pragmatic net zero emission strategies’, including reducing methane emissions and supporting the use of CCS, but it does not tackle the core issue of phasing down production. Beyond holding its first Ministerial meeting and establishing a working group in March 2022, there is little evidence of concrete action more than a year after its formation. Meanwhile, investors and international oil companies continue to exit Canada’s tar sands (Morgan, 2020; Reuters, 2021; The Canadian Press, 2020; Total, 2020; Tuttle, 2022).

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)

The province of Quebec is a member of BOGA, but Canada as a whole is not. In April 2022, Quebec passed a law banning any further production and mandated that existing drill sites be shut down within three years (Government of Quebec, 2022). The move is largely symbolic as the province is not a producer of oil and gas (Canada Energy Regulator, 2022).

**Coal mining**

In 2021, the government committed to banning thermal coal exports from and through Canada by 2030 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021b; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021b). The reference to ‘through Canada’ is important, as many American west coast miners export their coal through Canada due to resistance to developing the export infrastructure in their own country (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, 2021; Kuykendall, 2021). While establishing the ban is in the trade minister’s mandate letter, he has not yet taken action to implement it (Global Affairs Canada, 2022; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021a). On the contrary, Canadian coal exports soared in 2023, causing the opposition party to call the government to task on this issue (The Canadian Press, 2024a, 2024b).

Canada had been criticised for its hypocritical stance on coal mining, and for not subjecting a thermal coal mine expansion to a federal impact assessment, notwithstanding its position in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Rabson, 2020). In June 2021, Canada clarified its policy position on thermal coal mining, finding that any new mines or expansions of existing mines would likely cause unacceptable environmental effects (Government of Canada, 2021i). One coal mining expansion project is still attempting to get approval, with environmental groups fighting the government's decision to lift the requirement for an environmental impact assessment (Ecojustice, 2023; Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022b).


## Methane

15% of Canada’s emissions come from methane. The oil and gas sector is the largest source (48%) of Canada’s methane emissions, followed by agriculture (27%) and waste (18%) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The government has committed to reducing methane emissions from the sector by 40–45% below 2012 levels by 2025 and at least 75% by 2030, going beyond the pledges made in its 2022 national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018, 2021a, 2022d). It adopted regulations to support the 2025 target in 2018 but does not appear to be on track to achieve the 2025 goal (Government of Canada, 2018b, 2023e, 2020c, 2020a, 2020b). Additional regulations to support the 2030 goal were drafted in 2023 and are expected to be finalised in 2024 (Government of Canada, 2022k). The government is confident that they will allow it to reach and even exceed the 75% goal (Government of Canada, 2023d). We have modelled these in our planned policies scenario.

While strengthening its methane targets is a step in the right direction, emissions could be even higher than currently reported. Canada reports on emissions from the sector using bottom-up methods based on internationally agreed standards (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2021b). Research based on atmospheric measurements rather than energy statistics, suggests that emissions could be much higher (Chan et al., 2020; Liggio et al., 2019; MacKay et al., 2021). Canada made improvements to its upstream oil and gas methane emissions estimate methods in its 2022 inventory, which resulted in an upwards revision of emissions of between 31–39% over the last decade (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022e). It will continue to work to improve measuring and monitoring efforts as part of its national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26.


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions in Canada, after oil and gas, representing just under a quarter of the country’s emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). In its latest projections and progress reports, Canada foresees transport emissions reductions of 19% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b, 2023a).

Canada is taking steps to reduce transport emissions, but not at the speed needed for such a large source of the country’s emissions. A 2022 ‘action plan’ on road transport did little more than rehash existing targets, plans and funding schemes (Transport Canada, 2022a).

**Electric Vehicles**

Targets

Canada has had EV sales targets for the past several years. By 2035, 100% of new passenger car and light-duty trucks sales need to be electric vehicles, with interim targets of 20% by 2026 and 60% by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). In December 2023, the government adopted the necessary regulations to make these targets legally binding (Government of Canada, 2023g). Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are included in the definition of electric vehicles but their contribution to the sales target is capped at 20% from 2028. The sales targets increase in stringency annually, though at a slower pace in earlier years. The GHG impact of the regulations grows over time, but only contributes to minor reductions by 2030 (less than 5 MtCO2e).

In 2023, ~19% of all passenger car and truck sales were EVs, of which 8% were battery electric (Statistics Canada, 2024). Canada should easily achieve its (fairly low) 2026 interim target of 20%.

The CAT has not developed EV benchmarks for Canada; however, our US benchmark suggests that Canada’s targets are not 1.5°C compatible: 95–100% of all US passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in 2030 should be zero emission vehicles.

The government aims to electrify its own light-duty vehicles LDV fleet by 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a).

Medium and heavy-duty vehicles

Canada has also set targets for its medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) with the goal of achieving a 35% sales target by 2030 and 100% by 2040 for some models (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). Stakeholder consultation on the regulations to make these targets binding has begun, but the timeline for their adoption is not clear (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a).

Infrastructure and support programmes

The government began supporting the development of EV-related infrastructure and charging networks in 2016 (Natural Resources Canada, 2021b, 2021c, 2023). Canada has about 26,000 chargers at 10,000 locations across the country (Natural Resources Canada, 2024). Analysis suggests that Canada will need between 440,000-470,000 chargers in 2035 to support its 100% sales target (Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, 2022).

The government missed an opportunity to support residential charging infrastructure by not including them in the most recent building codes, though some municipalities are taking action (Kozelj, 2024). Making buildings EV-charger-ready through minor changes at the time of construction can significantly reduce the costs when the necessary equipment is actually installed (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

Since 2019, the federal government has provided rebates for the purchase or lease of EVs and will continue to do so until March 2025 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Transport Canada, 2022b). In July 2022, it launched a four-year, half billion CAD programme to support the purchase of medium and heavy duty electric vehicles (Transport Canada, 2022c).

**Vehicle emission standards**

Canadian fuel economy standards for light and heavy-duty vehicles are aligned with federal-level regulations in the US (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021h, 2018c). The Biden administration has been working on reversing the Trump era rollbacks, adopting new rules for emissions and fuel standards (see US assessment for details). GHG standards for new trailers have been delayed for several years in response to legal challenges to those standards in the US.

**Fuel standards**

In July 2023, the Clean Fuel Regulations finally took effect, though are unlikely to have much of an impact until 2025 (Bakx, 2023; Government of Canada, 2022p). The regulations require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels from 2016 levels, with increasing annual reductions through to 2030.

The regulations create a credit market for compliance, which allows those not subject to the regulations (like EV charging stations or low carbon fuel producers (e.g. biofuels)) to participate. The regulations aim to improve production processes in the oil and gas sector, foster production of low carbon fuels and enable end-use fuel switching in transport. The fuels used by remote communities, and in international shipping, and domestic and international aviation are exempt from the regulation. The renewable fuel content requirements, 2% for diesel and 5% for gasoline, as set out in the Renewable Fuels Regulations, have been incorporated in these new regulations (Government of Canada, 2010).

These regulations were first proposed in 2016 as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016a). Originally, standards were also supposed to be prepared for gaseous and solid fuels; however, these were delayed due to industry concerns over trade impacts and have since been shelved (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2017).

**Aviation**

Canada lacks effective policies to address its aviation emissions, which stand at 22 MtCO2e in 2019. Most of these emissions are not covered by its carbon pricing system, as this pertains to interprovincial travel only, and its clean fuel regulations (see above) do not extend to jet fuel. 70% of Canada’s aviation emissions are from international flights (Government of Canada, 2022b).

In 2022, Canada updated its aviation action plan (Government of Canada, 2022b). As part of the plan, the government commits to exploring ways to consistently apply carbon pricing to domestic aviation emissions.

The plan charts a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in which a shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is responsible for close to half of the needed reductions. In combination with increased efficiency in equipment and operations, this would offset the expected growth in air travel and bring emissions back to their 2005 levels (around 12 MtCO2e). These residual emissions would then need to be balanced by negative emissions, such as direct air capture. Around 70% of fuel used in 2050 would be SAF with a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower lifecycle emissions would increase the need for negative emissions outside the sector.

Canada does not produce commercially relevant amounts of SAF currently. In 2023, the airline industry produced a SAF roadmap which is considered an integral part of the government’s aviation action plan. The roadmap charts the requirements for this nascent technology to be able to grow to 25% fuel share by 2035. The roadmap assumes around 50% lifecycle emissions savings in SAF in contrast to the 90% reduction in the aviation plan.

Notably, the aviation plan’s four emission reduction measures are all targeting emission reductions per flight, rather than reducing the number of flights by making other transport modes more attractive. The plan only mentions a new highspeed rail network to connect the airports, rather than incentives to shift travel to rail connections to central stations in the major cities (Government of Canada, 2022b).


## Buildings

A little over a tenth of Canada’s emissions are from the buildings sector (excluding electricity) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Under the climate plan, the government hopes to cut emissions from the sector by 37% below 2005 levels, by 2030, yet emissions have stagnated since 2005 and the last progress report’s NDC-compatible scenario shows 25% of reductions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023b, 2023a). Provinces, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over building regulations; however, there is much the federal government can still do to provide direction and support.

The federal government has been active in four key areas under the 2016 Pan Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016b):

1) Creation of a ‘net-zero energy ready’ building code for new buildings,

2) programmes to encourage retrofits and fuel switch in existing buildings,

3) energy efficiency labelling, and

4) standards and renovation programmes in Indigenous communities.

Building on this framework, the government held a consultation in 2022 on a new Green Buildings Strategy aligned with the overall 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (Government of Canada, 2021j; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). The three main goals under the strategy are

1) all new buildings to be net-zero carbon ready by 2032 latest,

2) deep retrofit rate to increase to 3–5% per year by 2025,

3) transitioning from fossil-fuel based to electric water and space heating systems.

The Strategy was scheduled for release in 2023 but appears to be delayed.

The new building codes were adopted in 2022, after a two year delay (but are referred to as the ‘2020’ codes) (National Research Council Canada, 2020, 2022a, 2022b). They adopted a tiered system for the first time, which includes a ‘net zero energy ready’ level. (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready.

Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022). While the codes are heading in the right direction, they are missing key elements: there are no GHG emission requirements, nor provisions to support renewable or EV readiness, though GHG emissions will be addressed in the next update cycle (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b).

As 80% of the buildings stock that will exist in 2030 has already been built (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a), accelerating energy-efficient renovations and retrofits is crucial to decarbonising the sector. Canada has several programmes which support its goal of a 3–5% deep retrofit rate, including CAD 200m for a Deep Retrofit Accelerator Initiative for large buildings (Natural Resources Canada, n.d.), but additional measures are likely needed to achieve this goal. While we have not undertaken this analysis for Canada, the CAT estimates the USA and the EU would need to renovate at least 3.5% of the existing buildings stock per year to be compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit.

The government has also been slowly updating its energy efficiency regulations for a number of residential and commercial products (water heaters, furnaces, etc) and is planning a further round of revisions (Government of Canada, 2022l, 2019c, 2019b). Often the regulatory updates seek to align with existing standards in the USA. As part of the Green Buildings Strategy, it will adopt regulations to prohibit the installation of new oil or fossil gas heating systems and will develop incentives to accelerate heat pump adoption.


## Power

Electricity generation is responsible for less than 10% of Canada’s emissions. Its share of the country’s emissions has been falling since 2015 as Canada shifts away from coal (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b). The government has committed to achieving a net zero emissions grid by 2035 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021a). Draft regulations were issued in August 2023, but will not be adopted until 2024 (Government of Canada, 2023a).

To be 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

**Coal power phase out – almost, but not quite**

Canada co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 to help accelerate the rapid phase-out of “unabated” coal-fired electricity. It has had a regulatory system in place since 2018 to phase out “unabated” coal power by 2030 and is on track to achieve this phase-out. However, this regulation still allows plants which emit up to 420 gCO2/kWh, i.e. roughly half the emissions intensity of conventional coal power (Government of Canada, 2018d). Currently only three of its ten provinces still generate power from coal (Natural Resources Canada, 2023b). Alberta (Severson-Baker, 2024).

While these developments are positive, they fall short of the 1.5°C benchmark. The CAT does not see a role for coal power with CCS for three main reasons:

- CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants
- Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.
- The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives
Since 2014, Canada has had one coal-fired power plant equipped with CCS in operation (Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam), but it has been plagued with technical and operational problems and has still not met its annual CO2 capture target (Rives, 2022; SaskPower, 2022b, 2022a; Schlissel, 2021; Taylor, 2019).

**Fossil gas power phase-out**

To achieve its goal of a (net) zero emissions grid, the government proposed new Clean Electricity Regulations in 2023 to streamline and strengthen emissions performance standards for all fossil-generated electricity above 25 MW capacity (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a, 2018e).

These regulations will replace the coal and fossil gas regulations when they come into force in 2035. They will apply different rules to older plants (in operation before 2021) and newer plants (commissioned in or after 2021). For newer plants, any emissions that occur after 2035 would need to be offset or will be subject to the federal carbon price (which will be a minimum of CAD 170/tCO2e by that time). Exemptions will apply in cases of emergencies, when fossil gas without CCS may be used, and for remote northern communities (where much of the power is diesel generated). For older facilities, only emissions that exceed the sector benchmark of 370 gCO2/kWh need to be offset.

The regulations may also provide flexibility for newer fossil gas units built prior to 2025, which would be allowed to continue to operate ‘for a short prescribed period’ after 2035 (Government of Canada, 2022j). Cascade Power, a 900 MW fossil gas plant, due to start operation in 2024 could fall under such exception (Cascade Power, 2021). SaskPower is also building new fossil gas plants to come online in 2024–2026 (SaskPower, 2022a).

While the commitment to decarbonise its power sector by 2035 is a positive step, the extent to which Canada continues to build and rely on fossil gas is concerning, especially given that the cost of fossil gas is expected to increase further, while renewable electricity generation continues to get cheaper.

**Renewables**

Two-thirds of Canada’s electricity is already renewable, due to a long legacy of hydropower that still supplies 60% of demand. Solar and wind power are increasing fast, having grown from 2% to 7% market share in the last decade. Another 15% is nuclear power, leaving less than 20% to be supplied from fossil sources (IEA, 2023). Despite this strong starting position for achieving an early carbon-free grid, under current policy, Canada is expected to use gas for power generation beyond 2030, betting on CCS to deliver on its promise of a net-zero emissions grid by 2035.

Canada has several funding programmes for ‘clean electricity’ projects, including renewables, nuclear and CCS-projects as well as programmes to fund storage and grid strengthening (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

**Hydrogen**

Canada released its Hydrogen Strategy in 2020 (Natural Resources Canada, 2020). It sees the shift to hydrogen as a key contributor in meeting both its 2030 NDC and net zero goals. The Strategy estimates that Canada could reduce emissions by 22–45 MtCO2e by 2030, representing 15% of total reductions, by supplying 6% of final demand, primarily in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050 it foresees savings of 90–190 MtCO2e through the use of hydrogen representing 26% of total reductions, by supplying 30% of final demand. The Strategy is not limited to green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy only), but includes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS.

In contrast, Canada’s latest climate plan only includes a 15 MtCO2e reduction from hydrogen use by 2030. As much of the hydrogen would be produced using fossil gas, an additional 30 MtCO2e of CCUS capacity would be needed to capture the associated emissions (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). For comparison, Canada’s only commercial CCS abated coal-fired power plant in operation was designed to capture 1 MtCO2e and has not yet achieved this target (see above for details).

Canada’s Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development has heavily criticised the estimates in the Hydrogen Strategy, finding the underlying assumptions on policy implementation and price development ‘unrealistic’ (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022b; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). One example is the assumption that a blending level of 7.3% can be achieved in the medium term: In the absence of blending obligations for 2030 a carbon price of at least CAD 500/tCO2, rather than the anticipated CAD 170/tCO2, would be required to achieve this.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has reinforced the need for securing green hydrogen production and supply. In August 2022, Canada and Germany established a Hydrogen Alliance through which Canada would aim to start exporting hydrogen to Germany in 2025 (Government of Canada & Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, 2022).


## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for around 8% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The sector is projected to contribute around 4% of the emissions reductions in its latest 2030 climate plan. While the sector is responsible for 27% of the country’s methane emissions, it will contribute only about 1% of the reductions under Canada’s methane plan. Policy action is a mix of cross-cutting measures, individual targets and programmes and funding initiatives.

In 2020 Canada announced a voluntary target of reducing emissions from fertiliser use by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, a key source of N2O emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a). Direct emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertiliser have increased substantially since 2005. The government concluded consultations on the approaches to achieve the target in August 2022, but has not yet announced the next steps (Government of Canada, 2022c, 2022m, 2022n).

Some agricultural activities will be eligible for the federal government’s GHG offset system, established in June 2022. Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS). Protocols for projects related to livestock feed management and enhancing soil organic carbon are currently being developed and ones for manure management and anaerobic digestions are planned (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d; Government of Canada, 2022c).

Health Canada for the first time did not include a meat category, instead choosing to focus on “protein foods” (Government of Canada, 2019a; Health Canada, 2019). It also recommends choosing plant-based protein more often than other sources. Reducing emissions from agriculture, including through shifting the system to a more plant-based diet, will be key to meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions accounted for around 3% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022, but 18% of the country’s methane emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Municipal landfills are the primary source of emissions. Efforts to reduce methane emissions to date have only been able to balance out the increased waste generated from a growing population and thus current methane levels from landfills are at about the same level as 20 years ago (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada anticipates cutting methane emissions from the waste sector by 45% between 2020 and 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d). The government issued draft new regulations for consultation in 2023; final regulations are expected in 2024 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b; Government of Canada, 2023d).

In June 2022, the government finalised the details around generating offset credits from landfill methane recovery and destruction projects (Government of Canada, 2022j). These credits can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS).

The Food Waste Reduction Challenge (discussed in the agriculture section) will also contribute to avoiding emissions in the sector.


## Forestry

Canada’s vast forests have historically been both a source and a sink of emissions, officially contributing a small source in recent years. However, forest fires, and other disturbances like insect outbreaks, are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting. If these disturbances had been considered in 2018, for example, they would have added another 200 MtCO2e to Canada’s emissions, more than a quarter of the country’s reported total (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Forest fires are intensifying across the country, with 2023 setting a tragic record: 16.5 Mha of land were burnt, an area larger than the country of Greece and over double the previous record from 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023a).

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c). According to its most recent inventory of 2024, Canada’s forests have never been a net sink. Canada will need significantly more action in this sector if it is to achieve such a large sink.

**Two Billion Trees**

Canada has a number of initiatives to support nature-based solutions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a). Its flagship plan, finally launched in 2021, is to plant two billion trees during the 2020s (Government of Canada, 2021a; Liberal Party of Canada, 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2021c).

In April 2023, the country’s Auditor General expressed concern over the slow rollout of the plan, concluding that the two billion target would not be met without significant changes (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). The government contends that it is now back on-track (Natural Resources Canada, 2023e), yet the programme’s website still lacks basic tree planting information (how many planned versus actually planted) or any information about GHG sequestration.

The programme was designed to sequester up to 2 MtCO2e by 2030 and up to 11–12 MtCO2e by 2050, but the auditors concluded that it will be a tiny net source of emissions (0.1 MtCO2e) to 2030, due to emissions from planting activities and site preparation, and only sequester 4.3 MtCO2e in 2050 (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Even if achieved, these emission reductions may be at least partially cancelled out by emissions from forest fires, given that several projects under the programme are used to reforest areas lost to recent wildfires (Natural Resources Canada, 2023c).

For context, Canada intends to rely on 12 MtCO2e of sequestration towards in 2030 in its base case, which includes this programme, and up to 27 MtCO2e with additional programmes.

**GHG Offset System**

Afforestation projects are not yet eligible to register credits under the federal GHG Offset system, but the government has considered allowing this in future (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020b; Government of Canada, 2021f). If projects under the two billion trees initiative were eligible, this could open the door to double-counting of emissions reductions across the two systems.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is from Canada’s national GHG inventory and covers the period to 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024).


## NDC and other targets

**NDC**

We calculate a 40-45% reduction from base year emissions (2005) excluding LULUCF and then subtract the projected LULUCF contribution in 2030. That LULUCF contribution ranges from our own estimates based on the trend over the last decade (up to 35 MtCO2e source) at one end, to the values in the government’s 2023 emissions projections (up to -45 MtCO2e sink in the additional measures scenario) at the other end. These government estimated sink contributions are higher than the government’s previous estimates of -12 to -27 MtCO2e in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a).

The reason that we added our own estimates to the LULUCF contribution is that in the 2024 inventory, Canada revised its approach to LULUCF, making it an overall source rather than sink. However, the 2023 projections still take the former approach, meaning there is an inconsistency between the government’s projection and the inventory until the new projections are published. Hence, we added our own simplified estimates and show a range within which the actually expected values might likely fall.

Canada is still considering the extent to which it will rely on international carbon market credits (‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’ or ITMOs), however, it did indicate that it may use credits obtained under the Western Climate Initiative (a regional carbon market between some Canadian provinces and American states) for compliance with its 2030 target in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a). In its latest emissions projection report, that estimate for 2030 is 0.6 MtCO2e (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

We have added these potential credits to the NDC values we rate against modelled domestic pathways (i.e. the reductions that Canada should achieve within its borders), but subtract them in the NDC value we rate against the country’s fair share allocation.


## Current policy projections

Our current policy projection is based on the ‘Reference Case’, which is updated annually by the Government of Canada, harmonised to the last historical year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

The projections include policy measures in place as of August 2023. In December 2023, Canada adopted its EV sales mandate regulations. We have adjusted our current policy projection to reflect this change. Beyond that change, we consider the current policy projection to be an accurate picture of the policy landscape as of January 2024.

The EV sales mandate adjustment is based on the estimated impact of the measure as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement and the difference between the reference and with additional measures scenario (Government of Canada, 2023e).

We do not include any contribution from LULUCF or market credits from the Western Climate Initiative in our estimates.


## Planned policy projections

Our planned policy projection is based on the ‘with additional measures’ scenario provided by the government in its annual projections data, harmonised to the last historical emissions year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

In our last assessment, we excluded emissions reductions associated with hydrogen given the concerns of Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development over the validity of the modeling associated with those estimates (see the hydrogen section in the current policies tab for more details). The government has revised its assumptions for the impact of its hydrogen strategy downwards in its latest projection, so we no longer consider it necessary to make any adjustments to this pathway. Previously, the government had been assuming that 7.5% of blended marketable fossil gas would be from hydrogen, which has been revised down to 0.45%.

Note – Our COP28 global temperature update was based on data from Canada’s Fifth Biennial Report, harmonised to the latest historical emissions and included the adjustment for the reduced impact of the hydrogen strategy.


## Net zero target and other long-term targets

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target. We use this value for the residual emissions in their net zero target excluding LULUCF (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c).


## Global warming potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Targets Overview

Canada aims to cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030. It submitted a stronger target in 2021, but did not revise its target further in 2022, contrary to what it agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada‘s NDC and uncertainties in the data for the sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.

Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).

Under its domestic climate legislation, Canada is required to set its 2035 target by 1 December 2024.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022.


## NDC Updates

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021c). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 377-494 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded. This is around 20 MtCO2e higher than our previous estimate as Canada has increased its expected (emissions-reducing) contribution from the land sector and updated its historical emissions. The range has also widened due to the significant change to land sector emissions in Canada’s 2024 inventory which casts doubts on the possibility of this sector contributing the envisaged larger-scale emissions reductions in Canada’s climate plan.

The focus of Canada’s emissions reduction target is on cutting emissions domestically; however, in its NDC submission, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Canada is working on its policy towards international carbon credits (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

* Includes market credits of 0.6 MtCO2e. Note that due to the uncertainty on the LULUCF contribution to achieving the target, we rate the middle of the uncertainty range around the 40% reduction target, which is estimated at ~455 MtCO2e

** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target. We are showing how it would have been rating under our current system for the sake of comparability.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- 12.07. 2021 – Canada submits its updated NDC
- 22.04. 2021 – Canada announces a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO2e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric.

The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”).

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance.

Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.”

In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess.

Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020.

Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely.

At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023)

To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.


## Net Zero target and other long-term targets

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. The Act also mandates the setting of intermediary targets at five-year intervals (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), at least a decade in advance of each target, and several reporting requirements. The first Emissions Reduction Plan with targets for 2030 was published in March 2022 and the first progress report on it in 2023 with more reports planned for 2025 and 2027 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023a).

Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow, nor does it outline the policies and measures needed to achieve the target. Reliance on LULUCF and other CDR in 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

While Canada’s Net-Zero Act includes some positive measures, it does not follow good practice identified by the Climate Action Tracker on a number of other aspects, such as including emissions from international aviation and shipping into its target nor committing to achieve the entirety of the target through emissions reductions in Canada.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Canada aims to reach net zero by 2050, however, nothing in its Net-Zero Act precludes achieving net zero emissions before 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target does not cover international aviation and shipping. However, under the Net-Zero Act, it is possible to amend the coverage in future. Although not covered officially in the Act, or in Canada’s long-term strategy, Canada’s updated Aviation action plan (September 2022) covers both domestic and international aviation emissions and Canada reported on its activities related to both domestic and international aviation and shipping as part of its first progress report under the Act.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The scenarios explored in Canada’s updated LTS focus on achieving net zero emissions through domestic action; however, Canada notes that it may use reductions or removals outside of its borders (achieved through the purchase of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes) to meet its net zero target in 2050.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Canada passed its net zero target into law in June 2021 (Government of Canada, 2021e). It submitted an updated LTS to the UNFCCC in October 2022.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Canada does not have separate emissions reduction and removal targets. It does provide information on its LULUCF assumptions and possible reliance on DACCS and BECCS in its 2022 LTS update. The LULUCF contribution is defined ex-ante and constant across all modelling approaches, whereas the extent of CO2 removal technology usage is defined by the models.
- **Review process** – Canada must prepare progress reports on its intermediary five-year targets. However, there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets, only to explain why the target was not reached and to provide a description of the actions being taken in case of failure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). We have downgraded our previous rating of this element because Canada’s Net-Zero Act does not require the review of the net zero target itself but rather the milestone targets on the way to net zero in 2050.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Canada’s long-term strategy clearly includes reliance on LULUCF and other CO2 removal technology across the scenarios it considers. The LULUCF contribution is set ex-ante and consistent across all models, whereas the level of CO2 removal technology usage varies across the scenarios. The LULUCF contribution is set at 100 MtCO2e or 15% of Canada’s 2020 emissions, while CDR usage by 2050 is as high as 34% of the country’s 2020 emissions in some scenarios.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow or outline the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target.
Under the Net-Zero Act, the government is required to set an interim reduction target for 2026. The government established this target as 20% below 2005 levels, but does not consider this to be an official target (like its NDC), just a metric to measure progress against.

In February 2021, the government established an advisory body to assist it in developing net zero pathways (Government of Canada, 2021g). The 2021 Budget included five years of funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop and apply a ‘climate lens’ to federal decision-making processes (Government of Canada, 2021b).

- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The updated LTS does not provided an explanation for why Canada’s net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Under the Net Zero Act, the government must consider Canada’s international commitments under the Convention and Paris Agreement.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 Target Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement. Canada submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 12, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

The Canadian government announced the headline ambition of its 2035 target on 12 December 2024 committing to reducing its emissions by 45–50% below 2005 levels by 2035. Canada’s 2035 target would fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. A substantial gap remains between the 2035 target, particularly for the upper part of the range, and the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and this divergence from 1.5°C MDPs in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.

The Climate Action Tracker's analysis excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target in order to keep the focus on decarbonisation of the economy (e.g. the phase-out of fossil fuels) and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimates of Canada’s LULUCF emissions and removals.

We quantify Canada’s 2035 emissions reduction target excluding LULUCF as an actual 39–55% reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 or 336–458 MtCO2e in 2035. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, Canada would need to reduce its emissions excluding LULUCF by 66% below 2005 by 2035, or to 256 MtCO2e in 2035.

As Canada has yet to formally submit its NDC to the UNFCCC, there is still time for the government to improve its NDC prior to submission:

- **Submit fixed, absolute emission reduction targets**: Canada should communicate a fixed, absolute emissions reduction target for 2035 excluding LULUCF, and align it with our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathways. The current proposed range allows Canada to meet the least ambitious end while claiming to have achieved its target. The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada’s emissions reduction target range and underlying uncertainties in the data for the LULUCF sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.
- **Update 2030 NDC target**: Canada should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The most ambitious end of the current 2030 target range of a 34−50% emissions reduction relative to 2005 levels (excluding LULUCF) is very close to the 52% cut below 2005 needed to align with a 1.5ºC compatible pathway. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada committed to increasing the ambition of its NDCs which includes its 2030 target. Updating the 2030 target could also be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets.
- **Increase transparency on use of carbon credits**: While Canada should primarily focus on its domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy, if the Canadian government does intend to use carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement then it should transparently communicate how it intends to use them and to which extent. Currently, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Rather than relying on carbon credits or unproven technologies like CCS, Canada should shift the focus to proven solutions to effectively decarbonise its economy and transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Increase provision of climate finance**: Canada should increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF). Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this newly submitted 2035 target into reality.

# Policies & action

Canada’s emissions are finally starting to trend downwards as the government continues to implement its climate policy agenda, but there remains a significant gap between current policies and Canada’s NDC target. Implementing planned policies will contribute significantly to closing that gap, but further action is needed.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”, with the latest emissions projections showing significantly lower expected emissions for 2030. That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all of the measures it has planned, it would go a long way to closing this ambition gap.


## Policy overview

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work is needed. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 377–495 MtCO2e level Canada needs to reach to meet its updated NDC target.

In March 2022, Canada released its latest climate change plan, building on earlier strategies released in 2016 and 2020 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a; Government of Canada, 2016b). The measures outlined in the plan are not yet sufficient to ensure Canada meets its NDC target, nor have all been implemented yet. It came on the heels of a damning report in November 2021 by Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development outlining 30 years of the government’s failure to meet its targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2021; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2021).

Canada is developing additional policies which are captured in our planned policies scenario. Of the major initiatives (regulations for clean electricity, post-2026 LDV model year standards, oil and gas methane target, and landfill gas), only the EV sales mandate has been implemented since the government released its 2023 projections. Our current policy projection is based on these projections and modified to include the impact of the EV sales target.

The step-up in climate action over the last four years was driven by a vulnerable minority Liberal Party government, enabled through support from the New Democratic Party. This progress risks being dialled back after the next elections, set for 2025, if the Conservatives were to come to power. They have already promised to ‘Axe the tax’, i.e. abolish the carbon pricing system. In preparation, the government has designated almost half of the CAD 15 billion (USD 11bn) in the Canada Growth Fund to be spent on Contracts for Difference or similar offtake agreements to ensure stability to investors in the coming months (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023a)

Carbon pricing

Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019 (Government of Canada, 2018a). The legislation enacting the carbon pricing scheme, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, was found to be constitutional by the country’s top court in March 2021 after three provinces challenged it (Supreme Court of Canada, 2021). A second challenge from the province of Manitoba was also dismissed by the Federal Court in October 2021.

Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities. The federal government will review its carbon pricing benchmark in 2026.

The initial carbon price of CAD 20/tCO2e was set in 2019 and increased by CAD 10 per year, reaching CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. In its latest climate plan, the government stated it will increase the carbon price by another CAD 15 per year for the 2023–2030 period, reaching CAD 170/tCO2e in 2030 (around USD 125) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021k). While the carbon price is heading in the right direction, it is still below the USD 170–290 (2015$) needed to be compatible with 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2023).

A 2022 audit of the scheme found the government had taken steps to address some of the scheme’s weaknesses, but that requirements for large emitters were poor and could be strengthened (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022a; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022a).

National GHG Offset System

In June 2022, the federal government established a GHG Offset system for activities not covered by carbon pricing (Government of Canada, 2022e). Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the OBPS. At present, the system only covers landfill methane recovery and refrigeration systems, but protocols are being prepared for forest management, livestock feed management, enhanced soil carbon, manure methane emissions and direct air carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (Government of Canada, 2022c). The ministry is also looking into ways to remove barriers and enhance participation in the system by Indigenous peoples (Government of Canada, 2022f).


## Industry

**Oil and gas production**

At over a third of total emissions, oil and gas production represents Canada’s largest source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). While the sector’s emissions dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic, they are projected to reach again 2019 levels under current policies by 2030 as production is projected to increase. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are continuing to rise, surpassing its total domestic GHG emissions, and sitting at about 939 MtCO2 in 2022 (Bernstien, 2024). This comes at a time when the IEA has called for no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement.

The government seems incapable of kicking its oil and gas addiction. It has promised to set a cap on emissions for the sector, and believes this can be achieved while increasing production. Regulations for the cap are being consulted on in 2024 and are due to be finalised in 2025. They are not yet modelled in our projections. The government is also planning to strengthen methane emission regulations in the sector (see the Methane section below) (Government of Canada, 2023b).

In April 2022, the government approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject, Bay du Nord (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022a). The project is required to be net zero from 2050 onwards, but production could continue until 2058 (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2021, 2022a). The environment and energy ministers disagree over whether this will be the last development of its kind in Canada (CBC News, 2022). Whether the project will actually proceed is unclear: the company delayed the project by three years amidst concerns over high costs, and challenges to the environmental and economic assessments continue (Canada, 2023; Federal Court of Canada, 2023; Nickel, 2023; Sierra Club, 2024).

The costs of current oil and gas expansion projects continue to rise. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, due to start operation in 2024 (Calgary Herald, 2023; Trans Mountain Corporation, 2022), is now expected to cost seven times more than when the government first purchased the pipeline (CAD 5.4 bn) (Lindsay, 2021; Williams, 2023). In June 2022, a budget watchdog concluded that it was not viable and would cost the government around CAD 600 million in net losses (Thurton, 2022). Others have estimated that losses will be much higher (The Energy Mix, 2022; Williams, 2023).

Costs associated with the pipeline for the country’s first LNG export terminal, on the country’s west coast, are also soaring (Jang, 2022; Simmons, 2022). While this pipeline is not government-owned, there are questions as to whether it will be able to recoup all of the subsidies provided (Simmons, 2022). The LNG project will only begin exporting fossil gas to Asia in 2025–2026.

Meanwhile, a new anti-greenwashing regulation is causing oil and gas industry associations to scrub their websites of unsubstantiated CCS claims (Noakes, 2024).

Net-Zero Producers Forum

Canada is part of the ‘Net Zero Producers Forum’, along with other oil and gas majors: Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US (Natural Resources Canada, 2021a; U.S. Department of Energy, 2021). The forum’s stated aim is to develop ‘pragmatic net zero emission strategies’, including reducing methane emissions and supporting the use of CCS, but it does not tackle the core issue of phasing down production. Beyond holding its first Ministerial meeting and establishing a working group in March 2022, there is little evidence of concrete action more than a year after its formation. Meanwhile, investors and international oil companies continue to exit Canada’s tar sands (Morgan, 2020; Reuters, 2021; The Canadian Press, 2020; Total, 2020; Tuttle, 2022).

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)

The province of Quebec is a member of BOGA, but Canada as a whole is not. In April 2022, Quebec passed a law banning any further production and mandated that existing drill sites be shut down within three years (Government of Quebec, 2022). The move is largely symbolic as the province is not a producer of oil and gas (Canada Energy Regulator, 2022).

**Coal mining**

In 2021, the government committed to banning thermal coal exports from and through Canada by 2030 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021b; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021b). The reference to ‘through Canada’ is important, as many American west coast miners export their coal through Canada due to resistance to developing the export infrastructure in their own country (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, 2021; Kuykendall, 2021). While establishing the ban is in the trade minister’s mandate letter, he has not yet taken action to implement it (Global Affairs Canada, 2022; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021a). On the contrary, Canadian coal exports soared in 2023, causing the opposition party to call the government to task on this issue (The Canadian Press, 2024a, 2024b).

Canada had been criticised for its hypocritical stance on coal mining, and for not subjecting a thermal coal mine expansion to a federal impact assessment, notwithstanding its position in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Rabson, 2020). In June 2021, Canada clarified its policy position on thermal coal mining, finding that any new mines or expansions of existing mines would likely cause unacceptable environmental effects (Government of Canada, 2021i). One coal mining expansion project is still attempting to get approval, with environmental groups fighting the government's decision to lift the requirement for an environmental impact assessment (Ecojustice, 2023; Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022b).


## Methane

15% of Canada’s emissions come from methane. The oil and gas sector is the largest source (48%) of Canada’s methane emissions, followed by agriculture (27%) and waste (18%) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The government has committed to reducing methane emissions from the sector by 40–45% below 2012 levels by 2025 and at least 75% by 2030, going beyond the pledges made in its 2022 national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018, 2021a, 2022d). It adopted regulations to support the 2025 target in 2018 but does not appear to be on track to achieve the 2025 goal (Government of Canada, 2018b, 2023e, 2020c, 2020a, 2020b). Additional regulations to support the 2030 goal were drafted in 2023 and are expected to be finalised in 2024 (Government of Canada, 2022k). The government is confident that they will allow it to reach and even exceed the 75% goal (Government of Canada, 2023d). We have modelled these in our planned policies scenario.

While strengthening its methane targets is a step in the right direction, emissions could be even higher than currently reported. Canada reports on emissions from the sector using bottom-up methods based on internationally agreed standards (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2021b). Research based on atmospheric measurements rather than energy statistics, suggests that emissions could be much higher (Chan et al., 2020; Liggio et al., 2019; MacKay et al., 2021). Canada made improvements to its upstream oil and gas methane emissions estimate methods in its 2022 inventory, which resulted in an upwards revision of emissions of between 31–39% over the last decade (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022e). It will continue to work to improve measuring and monitoring efforts as part of its national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26.


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions in Canada, after oil and gas, representing just under a quarter of the country’s emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). In its latest projections and progress reports, Canada foresees transport emissions reductions of 19% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b, 2023a).

Canada is taking steps to reduce transport emissions, but not at the speed needed for such a large source of the country’s emissions. A 2022 ‘action plan’ on road transport did little more than rehash existing targets, plans and funding schemes (Transport Canada, 2022a).

**Electric Vehicles**

Targets

Canada has had EV sales targets for the past several years. By 2035, 100% of new passenger car and light-duty trucks sales need to be electric vehicles, with interim targets of 20% by 2026 and 60% by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). In December 2023, the government adopted the necessary regulations to make these targets legally binding (Government of Canada, 2023g). Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are included in the definition of electric vehicles but their contribution to the sales target is capped at 20% from 2028. The sales targets increase in stringency annually, though at a slower pace in earlier years. The GHG impact of the regulations grows over time, but only contributes to minor reductions by 2030 (less than 5 MtCO2e).

In 2023, ~19% of all passenger car and truck sales were EVs, of which 8% were battery electric (Statistics Canada, 2024). Canada should easily achieve its (fairly low) 2026 interim target of 20%.

The CAT has not developed EV benchmarks for Canada; however, our US benchmark suggests that Canada’s targets are not 1.5°C compatible: 95–100% of all US passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in 2030 should be zero emission vehicles.

The government aims to electrify its own light-duty vehicles LDV fleet by 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a).

Medium and heavy-duty vehicles

Canada has also set targets for its medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) with the goal of achieving a 35% sales target by 2030 and 100% by 2040 for some models (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). Stakeholder consultation on the regulations to make these targets binding has begun, but the timeline for their adoption is not clear (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a).

Infrastructure and support programmes

The government began supporting the development of EV-related infrastructure and charging networks in 2016 (Natural Resources Canada, 2021b, 2021c, 2023). Canada has about 26,000 chargers at 10,000 locations across the country (Natural Resources Canada, 2024). Analysis suggests that Canada will need between 440,000-470,000 chargers in 2035 to support its 100% sales target (Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, 2022).

The government missed an opportunity to support residential charging infrastructure by not including them in the most recent building codes, though some municipalities are taking action (Kozelj, 2024). Making buildings EV-charger-ready through minor changes at the time of construction can significantly reduce the costs when the necessary equipment is actually installed (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

Since 2019, the federal government has provided rebates for the purchase or lease of EVs and will continue to do so until March 2025 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Transport Canada, 2022b). In July 2022, it launched a four-year, half billion CAD programme to support the purchase of medium and heavy duty electric vehicles (Transport Canada, 2022c).

**Vehicle emission standards**

Canadian fuel economy standards for light and heavy-duty vehicles are aligned with federal-level regulations in the US (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021h, 2018c). The Biden administration has been working on reversing the Trump era rollbacks, adopting new rules for emissions and fuel standards (see US assessment for details). GHG standards for new trailers have been delayed for several years in response to legal challenges to those standards in the US.

**Fuel standards**

In July 2023, the Clean Fuel Regulations finally took effect, though are unlikely to have much of an impact until 2025 (Bakx, 2023; Government of Canada, 2022p). The regulations require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels from 2016 levels, with increasing annual reductions through to 2030.

The regulations create a credit market for compliance, which allows those not subject to the regulations (like EV charging stations or low carbon fuel producers (e.g. biofuels)) to participate. The regulations aim to improve production processes in the oil and gas sector, foster production of low carbon fuels and enable end-use fuel switching in transport. The fuels used by remote communities, and in international shipping, and domestic and international aviation are exempt from the regulation. The renewable fuel content requirements, 2% for diesel and 5% for gasoline, as set out in the Renewable Fuels Regulations, have been incorporated in these new regulations (Government of Canada, 2010).

These regulations were first proposed in 2016 as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016a). Originally, standards were also supposed to be prepared for gaseous and solid fuels; however, these were delayed due to industry concerns over trade impacts and have since been shelved (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2017).

**Aviation**

Canada lacks effective policies to address its aviation emissions, which stand at 22 MtCO2e in 2019. Most of these emissions are not covered by its carbon pricing system, as this pertains to interprovincial travel only, and its clean fuel regulations (see above) do not extend to jet fuel. 70% of Canada’s aviation emissions are from international flights (Government of Canada, 2022b).

In 2022, Canada updated its aviation action plan (Government of Canada, 2022b). As part of the plan, the government commits to exploring ways to consistently apply carbon pricing to domestic aviation emissions.

The plan charts a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in which a shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is responsible for close to half of the needed reductions. In combination with increased efficiency in equipment and operations, this would offset the expected growth in air travel and bring emissions back to their 2005 levels (around 12 MtCO2e). These residual emissions would then need to be balanced by negative emissions, such as direct air capture. Around 70% of fuel used in 2050 would be SAF with a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower lifecycle emissions would increase the need for negative emissions outside the sector.

Canada does not produce commercially relevant amounts of SAF currently. In 2023, the airline industry produced a SAF roadmap which is considered an integral part of the government’s aviation action plan. The roadmap charts the requirements for this nascent technology to be able to grow to 25% fuel share by 2035. The roadmap assumes around 50% lifecycle emissions savings in SAF in contrast to the 90% reduction in the aviation plan.

Notably, the aviation plan’s four emission reduction measures are all targeting emission reductions per flight, rather than reducing the number of flights by making other transport modes more attractive. The plan only mentions a new highspeed rail network to connect the airports, rather than incentives to shift travel to rail connections to central stations in the major cities (Government of Canada, 2022b).


## Buildings

A little over a tenth of Canada’s emissions are from the buildings sector (excluding electricity) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Under the climate plan, the government hopes to cut emissions from the sector by 37% below 2005 levels, by 2030, yet emissions have stagnated since 2005 and the last progress report’s NDC-compatible scenario shows 25% of reductions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023b, 2023a). Provinces, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over building regulations; however, there is much the federal government can still do to provide direction and support.

The federal government has been active in four key areas under the 2016 Pan Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016b):

1) Creation of a ‘net-zero energy ready’ building code for new buildings,

2) programmes to encourage retrofits and fuel switch in existing buildings,

3) energy efficiency labelling, and

4) standards and renovation programmes in Indigenous communities.

Building on this framework, the government held a consultation in 2022 on a new Green Buildings Strategy aligned with the overall 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (Government of Canada, 2021j; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). The three main goals under the strategy are

1) all new buildings to be net-zero carbon ready by 2032 latest,

2) deep retrofit rate to increase to 3–5% per year by 2025,

3) transitioning from fossil-fuel based to electric water and space heating systems.

The Strategy was scheduled for release in 2023 but appears to be delayed.

The new building codes were adopted in 2022, after a two year delay (but are referred to as the ‘2020’ codes) (National Research Council Canada, 2020, 2022a, 2022b). They adopted a tiered system for the first time, which includes a ‘net zero energy ready’ level. (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready.

Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022). While the codes are heading in the right direction, they are missing key elements: there are no GHG emission requirements, nor provisions to support renewable or EV readiness, though GHG emissions will be addressed in the next update cycle (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b).

As 80% of the buildings stock that will exist in 2030 has already been built (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a), accelerating energy-efficient renovations and retrofits is crucial to decarbonising the sector. Canada has several programmes which support its goal of a 3–5% deep retrofit rate, including CAD 200m for a Deep Retrofit Accelerator Initiative for large buildings (Natural Resources Canada, n.d.), but additional measures are likely needed to achieve this goal. While we have not undertaken this analysis for Canada, the CAT estimates the USA and the EU would need to renovate at least 3.5% of the existing buildings stock per year to be compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit.

The government has also been slowly updating its energy efficiency regulations for a number of residential and commercial products (water heaters, furnaces, etc) and is planning a further round of revisions (Government of Canada, 2022l, 2019c, 2019b). Often the regulatory updates seek to align with existing standards in the USA. As part of the Green Buildings Strategy, it will adopt regulations to prohibit the installation of new oil or fossil gas heating systems and will develop incentives to accelerate heat pump adoption.


## Power

Electricity generation is responsible for less than 10% of Canada’s emissions. Its share of the country’s emissions has been falling since 2015 as Canada shifts away from coal (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b). The government has committed to achieving a net zero emissions grid by 2035 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021a). Draft regulations were issued in August 2023, but will not be adopted until 2024 (Government of Canada, 2023a).

To be 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

**Coal power phase out – almost, but not quite**

Canada co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 to help accelerate the rapid phase-out of “unabated” coal-fired electricity. It has had a regulatory system in place since 2018 to phase out “unabated” coal power by 2030 and is on track to achieve this phase-out. However, this regulation still allows plants which emit up to 420 gCO2/kWh, i.e. roughly half the emissions intensity of conventional coal power (Government of Canada, 2018d). Currently only three of its ten provinces still generate power from coal (Natural Resources Canada, 2023b). Alberta (Severson-Baker, 2024).

While these developments are positive, they fall short of the 1.5°C benchmark. The CAT does not see a role for coal power with CCS for three main reasons:

- CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants
- Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.
- The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives
Since 2014, Canada has had one coal-fired power plant equipped with CCS in operation (Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam), but it has been plagued with technical and operational problems and has still not met its annual CO2 capture target (Rives, 2022; SaskPower, 2022b, 2022a; Schlissel, 2021; Taylor, 2019).

**Fossil gas power phase-out**

To achieve its goal of a (net) zero emissions grid, the government proposed new Clean Electricity Regulations in 2023 to streamline and strengthen emissions performance standards for all fossil-generated electricity above 25 MW capacity (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a, 2018e).

These regulations will replace the coal and fossil gas regulations when they come into force in 2035. They will apply different rules to older plants (in operation before 2021) and newer plants (commissioned in or after 2021). For newer plants, any emissions that occur after 2035 would need to be offset or will be subject to the federal carbon price (which will be a minimum of CAD 170/tCO2e by that time). Exemptions will apply in cases of emergencies, when fossil gas without CCS may be used, and for remote northern communities (where much of the power is diesel generated). For older facilities, only emissions that exceed the sector benchmark of 370 gCO2/kWh need to be offset.

The regulations may also provide flexibility for newer fossil gas units built prior to 2025, which would be allowed to continue to operate ‘for a short prescribed period’ after 2035 (Government of Canada, 2022j). Cascade Power, a 900 MW fossil gas plant, due to start operation in 2024 could fall under such exception (Cascade Power, 2021). SaskPower is also building new fossil gas plants to come online in 2024–2026 (SaskPower, 2022a).

While the commitment to decarbonise its power sector by 2035 is a positive step, the extent to which Canada continues to build and rely on fossil gas is concerning, especially given that the cost of fossil gas is expected to increase further, while renewable electricity generation continues to get cheaper.

**Renewables**

Two-thirds of Canada’s electricity is already renewable, due to a long legacy of hydropower that still supplies 60% of demand. Solar and wind power are increasing fast, having grown from 2% to 7% market share in the last decade. Another 15% is nuclear power, leaving less than 20% to be supplied from fossil sources (IEA, 2023). Despite this strong starting position for achieving an early carbon-free grid, under current policy, Canada is expected to use gas for power generation beyond 2030, betting on CCS to deliver on its promise of a net-zero emissions grid by 2035.

Canada has several funding programmes for ‘clean electricity’ projects, including renewables, nuclear and CCS-projects as well as programmes to fund storage and grid strengthening (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

**Hydrogen**

Canada released its Hydrogen Strategy in 2020 (Natural Resources Canada, 2020). It sees the shift to hydrogen as a key contributor in meeting both its 2030 NDC and net zero goals. The Strategy estimates that Canada could reduce emissions by 22–45 MtCO2e by 2030, representing 15% of total reductions, by supplying 6% of final demand, primarily in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050 it foresees savings of 90–190 MtCO2e through the use of hydrogen representing 26% of total reductions, by supplying 30% of final demand. The Strategy is not limited to green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy only), but includes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS.

In contrast, Canada’s latest climate plan only includes a 15 MtCO2e reduction from hydrogen use by 2030. As much of the hydrogen would be produced using fossil gas, an additional 30 MtCO2e of CCUS capacity would be needed to capture the associated emissions (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). For comparison, Canada’s only commercial CCS abated coal-fired power plant in operation was designed to capture 1 MtCO2e and has not yet achieved this target (see above for details).

Canada’s Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development has heavily criticised the estimates in the Hydrogen Strategy, finding the underlying assumptions on policy implementation and price development ‘unrealistic’ (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022b; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). One example is the assumption that a blending level of 7.3% can be achieved in the medium term: In the absence of blending obligations for 2030 a carbon price of at least CAD 500/tCO2, rather than the anticipated CAD 170/tCO2, would be required to achieve this.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has reinforced the need for securing green hydrogen production and supply. In August 2022, Canada and Germany established a Hydrogen Alliance through which Canada would aim to start exporting hydrogen to Germany in 2025 (Government of Canada & Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, 2022).


## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for around 8% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The sector is projected to contribute around 4% of the emissions reductions in its latest 2030 climate plan. While the sector is responsible for 27% of the country’s methane emissions, it will contribute only about 1% of the reductions under Canada’s methane plan. Policy action is a mix of cross-cutting measures, individual targets and programmes and funding initiatives.

In 2020 Canada announced a voluntary target of reducing emissions from fertiliser use by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, a key source of N2O emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a). Direct emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertiliser have increased substantially since 2005. The government concluded consultations on the approaches to achieve the target in August 2022, but has not yet announced the next steps (Government of Canada, 2022c, 2022m, 2022n).

Some agricultural activities will be eligible for the federal government’s GHG offset system, established in June 2022. Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS). Protocols for projects related to livestock feed management and enhancing soil organic carbon are currently being developed and ones for manure management and anaerobic digestions are planned (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d; Government of Canada, 2022c).

Health Canada for the first time did not include a meat category, instead choosing to focus on “protein foods” (Government of Canada, 2019a; Health Canada, 2019). It also recommends choosing plant-based protein more often than other sources. Reducing emissions from agriculture, including through shifting the system to a more plant-based diet, will be key to meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions accounted for around 3% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022, but 18% of the country’s methane emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Municipal landfills are the primary source of emissions. Efforts to reduce methane emissions to date have only been able to balance out the increased waste generated from a growing population and thus current methane levels from landfills are at about the same level as 20 years ago (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada anticipates cutting methane emissions from the waste sector by 45% between 2020 and 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d). The government issued draft new regulations for consultation in 2023; final regulations are expected in 2024 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b; Government of Canada, 2023d).

In June 2022, the government finalised the details around generating offset credits from landfill methane recovery and destruction projects (Government of Canada, 2022j). These credits can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS).

The Food Waste Reduction Challenge (discussed in the agriculture section) will also contribute to avoiding emissions in the sector.


## Forestry

Canada’s vast forests have historically been both a source and a sink of emissions, officially contributing a small source in recent years. However, forest fires, and other disturbances like insect outbreaks, are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting. If these disturbances had been considered in 2018, for example, they would have added another 200 MtCO2e to Canada’s emissions, more than a quarter of the country’s reported total (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Forest fires are intensifying across the country, with 2023 setting a tragic record: 16.5 Mha of land were burnt, an area larger than the country of Greece and over double the previous record from 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023a).

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c). According to its most recent inventory of 2024, Canada’s forests have never been a net sink. Canada will need significantly more action in this sector if it is to achieve such a large sink.

**Two Billion Trees**

Canada has a number of initiatives to support nature-based solutions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a). Its flagship plan, finally launched in 2021, is to plant two billion trees during the 2020s (Government of Canada, 2021a; Liberal Party of Canada, 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2021c).

In April 2023, the country’s Auditor General expressed concern over the slow rollout of the plan, concluding that the two billion target would not be met without significant changes (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). The government contends that it is now back on-track (Natural Resources Canada, 2023e), yet the programme’s website still lacks basic tree planting information (how many planned versus actually planted) or any information about GHG sequestration.

The programme was designed to sequester up to 2 MtCO2e by 2030 and up to 11–12 MtCO2e by 2050, but the auditors concluded that it will be a tiny net source of emissions (0.1 MtCO2e) to 2030, due to emissions from planting activities and site preparation, and only sequester 4.3 MtCO2e in 2050 (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Even if achieved, these emission reductions may be at least partially cancelled out by emissions from forest fires, given that several projects under the programme are used to reforest areas lost to recent wildfires (Natural Resources Canada, 2023c).

For context, Canada intends to rely on 12 MtCO2e of sequestration towards in 2030 in its base case, which includes this programme, and up to 27 MtCO2e with additional programmes.

**GHG Offset System**

Afforestation projects are not yet eligible to register credits under the federal GHG Offset system, but the government has considered allowing this in future (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020b; Government of Canada, 2021f). If projects under the two billion trees initiative were eligible, this could open the door to double-counting of emissions reductions across the two systems.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is from Canada’s national GHG inventory and covers the period to 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024).


## NDC and other targets

**NDC**

We calculate a 40-45% reduction from base year emissions (2005) excluding LULUCF and then subtract the projected LULUCF contribution in 2030. That LULUCF contribution ranges from our own estimates based on the trend over the last decade (up to 35 MtCO2e source) at one end, to the values in the government’s 2023 emissions projections (up to -45 MtCO2e sink in the additional measures scenario) at the other end. These government estimated sink contributions are higher than the government’s previous estimates of -12 to -27 MtCO2e in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a).

The reason that we added our own estimates to the LULUCF contribution is that in the 2024 inventory, Canada revised its approach to LULUCF, making it an overall source rather than sink. However, the 2023 projections still take the former approach, meaning there is an inconsistency between the government’s projection and the inventory until the new projections are published. Hence, we added our own simplified estimates and show a range within which the actually expected values might likely fall.

Canada is still considering the extent to which it will rely on international carbon market credits (‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’ or ITMOs), however, it did indicate that it may use credits obtained under the Western Climate Initiative (a regional carbon market between some Canadian provinces and American states) for compliance with its 2030 target in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a). In its latest emissions projection report, that estimate for 2030 is 0.6 MtCO2e (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

We have added these potential credits to the NDC values we rate against modelled domestic pathways (i.e. the reductions that Canada should achieve within its borders), but subtract them in the NDC value we rate against the country’s fair share allocation.


## Current policy projections

Our current policy projection is based on the ‘Reference Case’, which is updated annually by the Government of Canada, harmonised to the last historical year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

The projections include policy measures in place as of August 2023. In December 2023, Canada adopted its EV sales mandate regulations. We have adjusted our current policy projection to reflect this change. Beyond that change, we consider the current policy projection to be an accurate picture of the policy landscape as of January 2024.

The EV sales mandate adjustment is based on the estimated impact of the measure as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement and the difference between the reference and with additional measures scenario (Government of Canada, 2023e).

We do not include any contribution from LULUCF or market credits from the Western Climate Initiative in our estimates.


## Planned policy projections

Our planned policy projection is based on the ‘with additional measures’ scenario provided by the government in its annual projections data, harmonised to the last historical emissions year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

In our last assessment, we excluded emissions reductions associated with hydrogen given the concerns of Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development over the validity of the modeling associated with those estimates (see the hydrogen section in the current policies tab for more details). The government has revised its assumptions for the impact of its hydrogen strategy downwards in its latest projection, so we no longer consider it necessary to make any adjustments to this pathway. Previously, the government had been assuming that 7.5% of blended marketable fossil gas would be from hydrogen, which has been revised down to 0.45%.

Note – Our COP28 global temperature update was based on data from Canada’s Fifth Biennial Report, harmonised to the latest historical emissions and included the adjustment for the reduced impact of the hydrogen strategy.


## Net zero target and other long-term targets

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target. We use this value for the residual emissions in their net zero target excluding LULUCF (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c).


## Global warming potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Targets Overview

Canada aims to cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030. It submitted a stronger target in 2021, but did not revise its target further in 2022, contrary to what it agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada‘s NDC and uncertainties in the data for the sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.

Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).

Under its domestic climate legislation, Canada is required to set its 2035 target by 1 December 2024.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022.


## NDC Updates

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021c). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 377-494 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded. This is around 20 MtCO2e higher than our previous estimate as Canada has increased its expected (emissions-reducing) contribution from the land sector and updated its historical emissions. The range has also widened due to the significant change to land sector emissions in Canada’s 2024 inventory which casts doubts on the possibility of this sector contributing the envisaged larger-scale emissions reductions in Canada’s climate plan.

The focus of Canada’s emissions reduction target is on cutting emissions domestically; however, in its NDC submission, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Canada is working on its policy towards international carbon credits (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

* Includes market credits of 0.6 MtCO2e. Note that due to the uncertainty on the LULUCF contribution to achieving the target, we rate the middle of the uncertainty range around the 40% reduction target, which is estimated at ~455 MtCO2e

** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target. We are showing how it would have been rating under our current system for the sake of comparability.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- 12.07. 2021 – Canada submits its updated NDC
- 22.04. 2021 – Canada announces a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO2e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric.

The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”).

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance.

Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.”

In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess.

Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020.

Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely.

At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023)

To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.


## Net Zero target and other long-term targets

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. The Act also mandates the setting of intermediary targets at five-year intervals (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), at least a decade in advance of each target, and several reporting requirements. The first Emissions Reduction Plan with targets for 2030 was published in March 2022 and the first progress report on it in 2023 with more reports planned for 2025 and 2027 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023a).

Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow, nor does it outline the policies and measures needed to achieve the target. Reliance on LULUCF and other CDR in 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

While Canada’s Net-Zero Act includes some positive measures, it does not follow good practice identified by the Climate Action Tracker on a number of other aspects, such as including emissions from international aviation and shipping into its target nor committing to achieve the entirety of the target through emissions reductions in Canada.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Canada aims to reach net zero by 2050, however, nothing in its Net-Zero Act precludes achieving net zero emissions before 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target does not cover international aviation and shipping. However, under the Net-Zero Act, it is possible to amend the coverage in future. Although not covered officially in the Act, or in Canada’s long-term strategy, Canada’s updated Aviation action plan (September 2022) covers both domestic and international aviation emissions and Canada reported on its activities related to both domestic and international aviation and shipping as part of its first progress report under the Act.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The scenarios explored in Canada’s updated LTS focus on achieving net zero emissions through domestic action; however, Canada notes that it may use reductions or removals outside of its borders (achieved through the purchase of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes) to meet its net zero target in 2050.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Canada passed its net zero target into law in June 2021 (Government of Canada, 2021e). It submitted an updated LTS to the UNFCCC in October 2022.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Canada does not have separate emissions reduction and removal targets. It does provide information on its LULUCF assumptions and possible reliance on DACCS and BECCS in its 2022 LTS update. The LULUCF contribution is defined ex-ante and constant across all modelling approaches, whereas the extent of CO2 removal technology usage is defined by the models.
- **Review process** – Canada must prepare progress reports on its intermediary five-year targets. However, there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets, only to explain why the target was not reached and to provide a description of the actions being taken in case of failure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). We have downgraded our previous rating of this element because Canada’s Net-Zero Act does not require the review of the net zero target itself but rather the milestone targets on the way to net zero in 2050.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Canada’s long-term strategy clearly includes reliance on LULUCF and other CO2 removal technology across the scenarios it considers. The LULUCF contribution is set ex-ante and consistent across all models, whereas the level of CO2 removal technology usage varies across the scenarios. The LULUCF contribution is set at 100 MtCO2e or 15% of Canada’s 2020 emissions, while CDR usage by 2050 is as high as 34% of the country’s 2020 emissions in some scenarios.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow or outline the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target.
Under the Net-Zero Act, the government is required to set an interim reduction target for 2026. The government established this target as 20% below 2005 levels, but does not consider this to be an official target (like its NDC), just a metric to measure progress against.

In February 2021, the government established an advisory body to assist it in developing net zero pathways (Government of Canada, 2021g). The 2021 Budget included five years of funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop and apply a ‘climate lens’ to federal decision-making processes (Government of Canada, 2021b).

- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The updated LTS does not provided an explanation for why Canada’s net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Under the Net Zero Act, the government must consider Canada’s international commitments under the Convention and Paris Agreement.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 Target Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement. Canada submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 12, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

The Canadian government announced the headline ambition of its 2035 target on 12 December 2024 committing to reducing its emissions by 45–50% below 2005 levels by 2035. Canada’s 2035 target would fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. A substantial gap remains between the 2035 target, particularly for the upper part of the range, and the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and this divergence from 1.5°C MDPs in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.

The Climate Action Tracker's analysis excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target in order to keep the focus on decarbonisation of the economy (e.g. the phase-out of fossil fuels) and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimates of Canada’s LULUCF emissions and removals.

We quantify Canada’s 2035 emissions reduction target excluding LULUCF as an actual 39–55% reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 or 336–458 MtCO2e in 2035. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, Canada would need to reduce its emissions excluding LULUCF by 66% below 2005 by 2035, or to 256 MtCO2e in 2035.

As Canada has yet to formally submit its NDC to the UNFCCC, there is still time for the government to improve its NDC prior to submission:

- **Submit fixed, absolute emission reduction targets**: Canada should communicate a fixed, absolute emissions reduction target for 2035 excluding LULUCF, and align it with our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathways. The current proposed range allows Canada to meet the least ambitious end while claiming to have achieved its target. The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada’s emissions reduction target range and underlying uncertainties in the data for the LULUCF sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.
- **Update 2030 NDC target**: Canada should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The most ambitious end of the current 2030 target range of a 34−50% emissions reduction relative to 2005 levels (excluding LULUCF) is very close to the 52% cut below 2005 needed to align with a 1.5ºC compatible pathway. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada committed to increasing the ambition of its NDCs which includes its 2030 target. Updating the 2030 target could also be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets.
- **Increase transparency on use of carbon credits**: While Canada should primarily focus on its domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy, if the Canadian government does intend to use carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement then it should transparently communicate how it intends to use them and to which extent. Currently, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Rather than relying on carbon credits or unproven technologies like CCS, Canada should shift the focus to proven solutions to effectively decarbonise its economy and transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Increase provision of climate finance**: Canada should increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF). Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this newly submitted 2035 target into reality.

# Policies & action

Canada’s emissions are finally starting to trend downwards as the government continues to implement its climate policy agenda, but there remains a significant gap between current policies and Canada’s NDC target. Implementing planned policies will contribute significantly to closing that gap, but further action is needed.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”, with the latest emissions projections showing significantly lower expected emissions for 2030. That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all of the measures it has planned, it would go a long way to closing this ambition gap.


## Policy overview

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work is needed. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 377–495 MtCO2e level Canada needs to reach to meet its updated NDC target.

In March 2022, Canada released its latest climate change plan, building on earlier strategies released in 2016 and 2020 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a; Government of Canada, 2016b). The measures outlined in the plan are not yet sufficient to ensure Canada meets its NDC target, nor have all been implemented yet. It came on the heels of a damning report in November 2021 by Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development outlining 30 years of the government’s failure to meet its targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2021; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2021).

Canada is developing additional policies which are captured in our planned policies scenario. Of the major initiatives (regulations for clean electricity, post-2026 LDV model year standards, oil and gas methane target, and landfill gas), only the EV sales mandate has been implemented since the government released its 2023 projections. Our current policy projection is based on these projections and modified to include the impact of the EV sales target.

The step-up in climate action over the last four years was driven by a vulnerable minority Liberal Party government, enabled through support from the New Democratic Party. This progress risks being dialled back after the next elections, set for 2025, if the Conservatives were to come to power. They have already promised to ‘Axe the tax’, i.e. abolish the carbon pricing system. In preparation, the government has designated almost half of the CAD 15 billion (USD 11bn) in the Canada Growth Fund to be spent on Contracts for Difference or similar offtake agreements to ensure stability to investors in the coming months (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023a)

Carbon pricing

Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019 (Government of Canada, 2018a). The legislation enacting the carbon pricing scheme, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, was found to be constitutional by the country’s top court in March 2021 after three provinces challenged it (Supreme Court of Canada, 2021). A second challenge from the province of Manitoba was also dismissed by the Federal Court in October 2021.

Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities. The federal government will review its carbon pricing benchmark in 2026.

The initial carbon price of CAD 20/tCO2e was set in 2019 and increased by CAD 10 per year, reaching CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. In its latest climate plan, the government stated it will increase the carbon price by another CAD 15 per year for the 2023–2030 period, reaching CAD 170/tCO2e in 2030 (around USD 125) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021k). While the carbon price is heading in the right direction, it is still below the USD 170–290 (2015$) needed to be compatible with 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2023).

A 2022 audit of the scheme found the government had taken steps to address some of the scheme’s weaknesses, but that requirements for large emitters were poor and could be strengthened (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022a; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022a).

National GHG Offset System

In June 2022, the federal government established a GHG Offset system for activities not covered by carbon pricing (Government of Canada, 2022e). Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the OBPS. At present, the system only covers landfill methane recovery and refrigeration systems, but protocols are being prepared for forest management, livestock feed management, enhanced soil carbon, manure methane emissions and direct air carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (Government of Canada, 2022c). The ministry is also looking into ways to remove barriers and enhance participation in the system by Indigenous peoples (Government of Canada, 2022f).


## Industry

**Oil and gas production**

At over a third of total emissions, oil and gas production represents Canada’s largest source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). While the sector’s emissions dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic, they are projected to reach again 2019 levels under current policies by 2030 as production is projected to increase. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are continuing to rise, surpassing its total domestic GHG emissions, and sitting at about 939 MtCO2 in 2022 (Bernstien, 2024). This comes at a time when the IEA has called for no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement.

The government seems incapable of kicking its oil and gas addiction. It has promised to set a cap on emissions for the sector, and believes this can be achieved while increasing production. Regulations for the cap are being consulted on in 2024 and are due to be finalised in 2025. They are not yet modelled in our projections. The government is also planning to strengthen methane emission regulations in the sector (see the Methane section below) (Government of Canada, 2023b).

In April 2022, the government approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject, Bay du Nord (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022a). The project is required to be net zero from 2050 onwards, but production could continue until 2058 (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2021, 2022a). The environment and energy ministers disagree over whether this will be the last development of its kind in Canada (CBC News, 2022). Whether the project will actually proceed is unclear: the company delayed the project by three years amidst concerns over high costs, and challenges to the environmental and economic assessments continue (Canada, 2023; Federal Court of Canada, 2023; Nickel, 2023; Sierra Club, 2024).

The costs of current oil and gas expansion projects continue to rise. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, due to start operation in 2024 (Calgary Herald, 2023; Trans Mountain Corporation, 2022), is now expected to cost seven times more than when the government first purchased the pipeline (CAD 5.4 bn) (Lindsay, 2021; Williams, 2023). In June 2022, a budget watchdog concluded that it was not viable and would cost the government around CAD 600 million in net losses (Thurton, 2022). Others have estimated that losses will be much higher (The Energy Mix, 2022; Williams, 2023).

Costs associated with the pipeline for the country’s first LNG export terminal, on the country’s west coast, are also soaring (Jang, 2022; Simmons, 2022). While this pipeline is not government-owned, there are questions as to whether it will be able to recoup all of the subsidies provided (Simmons, 2022). The LNG project will only begin exporting fossil gas to Asia in 2025–2026.

Meanwhile, a new anti-greenwashing regulation is causing oil and gas industry associations to scrub their websites of unsubstantiated CCS claims (Noakes, 2024).

Net-Zero Producers Forum

Canada is part of the ‘Net Zero Producers Forum’, along with other oil and gas majors: Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US (Natural Resources Canada, 2021a; U.S. Department of Energy, 2021). The forum’s stated aim is to develop ‘pragmatic net zero emission strategies’, including reducing methane emissions and supporting the use of CCS, but it does not tackle the core issue of phasing down production. Beyond holding its first Ministerial meeting and establishing a working group in March 2022, there is little evidence of concrete action more than a year after its formation. Meanwhile, investors and international oil companies continue to exit Canada’s tar sands (Morgan, 2020; Reuters, 2021; The Canadian Press, 2020; Total, 2020; Tuttle, 2022).

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)

The province of Quebec is a member of BOGA, but Canada as a whole is not. In April 2022, Quebec passed a law banning any further production and mandated that existing drill sites be shut down within three years (Government of Quebec, 2022). The move is largely symbolic as the province is not a producer of oil and gas (Canada Energy Regulator, 2022).

**Coal mining**

In 2021, the government committed to banning thermal coal exports from and through Canada by 2030 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021b; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021b). The reference to ‘through Canada’ is important, as many American west coast miners export their coal through Canada due to resistance to developing the export infrastructure in their own country (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, 2021; Kuykendall, 2021). While establishing the ban is in the trade minister’s mandate letter, he has not yet taken action to implement it (Global Affairs Canada, 2022; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021a). On the contrary, Canadian coal exports soared in 2023, causing the opposition party to call the government to task on this issue (The Canadian Press, 2024a, 2024b).

Canada had been criticised for its hypocritical stance on coal mining, and for not subjecting a thermal coal mine expansion to a federal impact assessment, notwithstanding its position in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Rabson, 2020). In June 2021, Canada clarified its policy position on thermal coal mining, finding that any new mines or expansions of existing mines would likely cause unacceptable environmental effects (Government of Canada, 2021i). One coal mining expansion project is still attempting to get approval, with environmental groups fighting the government's decision to lift the requirement for an environmental impact assessment (Ecojustice, 2023; Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022b).


## Methane

15% of Canada’s emissions come from methane. The oil and gas sector is the largest source (48%) of Canada’s methane emissions, followed by agriculture (27%) and waste (18%) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The government has committed to reducing methane emissions from the sector by 40–45% below 2012 levels by 2025 and at least 75% by 2030, going beyond the pledges made in its 2022 national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018, 2021a, 2022d). It adopted regulations to support the 2025 target in 2018 but does not appear to be on track to achieve the 2025 goal (Government of Canada, 2018b, 2023e, 2020c, 2020a, 2020b). Additional regulations to support the 2030 goal were drafted in 2023 and are expected to be finalised in 2024 (Government of Canada, 2022k). The government is confident that they will allow it to reach and even exceed the 75% goal (Government of Canada, 2023d). We have modelled these in our planned policies scenario.

While strengthening its methane targets is a step in the right direction, emissions could be even higher than currently reported. Canada reports on emissions from the sector using bottom-up methods based on internationally agreed standards (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2021b). Research based on atmospheric measurements rather than energy statistics, suggests that emissions could be much higher (Chan et al., 2020; Liggio et al., 2019; MacKay et al., 2021). Canada made improvements to its upstream oil and gas methane emissions estimate methods in its 2022 inventory, which resulted in an upwards revision of emissions of between 31–39% over the last decade (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022e). It will continue to work to improve measuring and monitoring efforts as part of its national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26.


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions in Canada, after oil and gas, representing just under a quarter of the country’s emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). In its latest projections and progress reports, Canada foresees transport emissions reductions of 19% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b, 2023a).

Canada is taking steps to reduce transport emissions, but not at the speed needed for such a large source of the country’s emissions. A 2022 ‘action plan’ on road transport did little more than rehash existing targets, plans and funding schemes (Transport Canada, 2022a).

**Electric Vehicles**

Targets

Canada has had EV sales targets for the past several years. By 2035, 100% of new passenger car and light-duty trucks sales need to be electric vehicles, with interim targets of 20% by 2026 and 60% by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). In December 2023, the government adopted the necessary regulations to make these targets legally binding (Government of Canada, 2023g). Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are included in the definition of electric vehicles but their contribution to the sales target is capped at 20% from 2028. The sales targets increase in stringency annually, though at a slower pace in earlier years. The GHG impact of the regulations grows over time, but only contributes to minor reductions by 2030 (less than 5 MtCO2e).

In 2023, ~19% of all passenger car and truck sales were EVs, of which 8% were battery electric (Statistics Canada, 2024). Canada should easily achieve its (fairly low) 2026 interim target of 20%.

The CAT has not developed EV benchmarks for Canada; however, our US benchmark suggests that Canada’s targets are not 1.5°C compatible: 95–100% of all US passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in 2030 should be zero emission vehicles.

The government aims to electrify its own light-duty vehicles LDV fleet by 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a).

Medium and heavy-duty vehicles

Canada has also set targets for its medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) with the goal of achieving a 35% sales target by 2030 and 100% by 2040 for some models (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). Stakeholder consultation on the regulations to make these targets binding has begun, but the timeline for their adoption is not clear (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a).

Infrastructure and support programmes

The government began supporting the development of EV-related infrastructure and charging networks in 2016 (Natural Resources Canada, 2021b, 2021c, 2023). Canada has about 26,000 chargers at 10,000 locations across the country (Natural Resources Canada, 2024). Analysis suggests that Canada will need between 440,000-470,000 chargers in 2035 to support its 100% sales target (Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, 2022).

The government missed an opportunity to support residential charging infrastructure by not including them in the most recent building codes, though some municipalities are taking action (Kozelj, 2024). Making buildings EV-charger-ready through minor changes at the time of construction can significantly reduce the costs when the necessary equipment is actually installed (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

Since 2019, the federal government has provided rebates for the purchase or lease of EVs and will continue to do so until March 2025 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Transport Canada, 2022b). In July 2022, it launched a four-year, half billion CAD programme to support the purchase of medium and heavy duty electric vehicles (Transport Canada, 2022c).

**Vehicle emission standards**

Canadian fuel economy standards for light and heavy-duty vehicles are aligned with federal-level regulations in the US (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021h, 2018c). The Biden administration has been working on reversing the Trump era rollbacks, adopting new rules for emissions and fuel standards (see US assessment for details). GHG standards for new trailers have been delayed for several years in response to legal challenges to those standards in the US.

**Fuel standards**

In July 2023, the Clean Fuel Regulations finally took effect, though are unlikely to have much of an impact until 2025 (Bakx, 2023; Government of Canada, 2022p). The regulations require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels from 2016 levels, with increasing annual reductions through to 2030.

The regulations create a credit market for compliance, which allows those not subject to the regulations (like EV charging stations or low carbon fuel producers (e.g. biofuels)) to participate. The regulations aim to improve production processes in the oil and gas sector, foster production of low carbon fuels and enable end-use fuel switching in transport. The fuels used by remote communities, and in international shipping, and domestic and international aviation are exempt from the regulation. The renewable fuel content requirements, 2% for diesel and 5% for gasoline, as set out in the Renewable Fuels Regulations, have been incorporated in these new regulations (Government of Canada, 2010).

These regulations were first proposed in 2016 as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016a). Originally, standards were also supposed to be prepared for gaseous and solid fuels; however, these were delayed due to industry concerns over trade impacts and have since been shelved (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2017).

**Aviation**

Canada lacks effective policies to address its aviation emissions, which stand at 22 MtCO2e in 2019. Most of these emissions are not covered by its carbon pricing system, as this pertains to interprovincial travel only, and its clean fuel regulations (see above) do not extend to jet fuel. 70% of Canada’s aviation emissions are from international flights (Government of Canada, 2022b).

In 2022, Canada updated its aviation action plan (Government of Canada, 2022b). As part of the plan, the government commits to exploring ways to consistently apply carbon pricing to domestic aviation emissions.

The plan charts a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in which a shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is responsible for close to half of the needed reductions. In combination with increased efficiency in equipment and operations, this would offset the expected growth in air travel and bring emissions back to their 2005 levels (around 12 MtCO2e). These residual emissions would then need to be balanced by negative emissions, such as direct air capture. Around 70% of fuel used in 2050 would be SAF with a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower lifecycle emissions would increase the need for negative emissions outside the sector.

Canada does not produce commercially relevant amounts of SAF currently. In 2023, the airline industry produced a SAF roadmap which is considered an integral part of the government’s aviation action plan. The roadmap charts the requirements for this nascent technology to be able to grow to 25% fuel share by 2035. The roadmap assumes around 50% lifecycle emissions savings in SAF in contrast to the 90% reduction in the aviation plan.

Notably, the aviation plan’s four emission reduction measures are all targeting emission reductions per flight, rather than reducing the number of flights by making other transport modes more attractive. The plan only mentions a new highspeed rail network to connect the airports, rather than incentives to shift travel to rail connections to central stations in the major cities (Government of Canada, 2022b).


## Buildings

A little over a tenth of Canada’s emissions are from the buildings sector (excluding electricity) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Under the climate plan, the government hopes to cut emissions from the sector by 37% below 2005 levels, by 2030, yet emissions have stagnated since 2005 and the last progress report’s NDC-compatible scenario shows 25% of reductions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023b, 2023a). Provinces, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over building regulations; however, there is much the federal government can still do to provide direction and support.

The federal government has been active in four key areas under the 2016 Pan Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016b):

1) Creation of a ‘net-zero energy ready’ building code for new buildings,

2) programmes to encourage retrofits and fuel switch in existing buildings,

3) energy efficiency labelling, and

4) standards and renovation programmes in Indigenous communities.

Building on this framework, the government held a consultation in 2022 on a new Green Buildings Strategy aligned with the overall 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (Government of Canada, 2021j; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). The three main goals under the strategy are

1) all new buildings to be net-zero carbon ready by 2032 latest,

2) deep retrofit rate to increase to 3–5% per year by 2025,

3) transitioning from fossil-fuel based to electric water and space heating systems.

The Strategy was scheduled for release in 2023 but appears to be delayed.

The new building codes were adopted in 2022, after a two year delay (but are referred to as the ‘2020’ codes) (National Research Council Canada, 2020, 2022a, 2022b). They adopted a tiered system for the first time, which includes a ‘net zero energy ready’ level. (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready.

Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022). While the codes are heading in the right direction, they are missing key elements: there are no GHG emission requirements, nor provisions to support renewable or EV readiness, though GHG emissions will be addressed in the next update cycle (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b).

As 80% of the buildings stock that will exist in 2030 has already been built (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a), accelerating energy-efficient renovations and retrofits is crucial to decarbonising the sector. Canada has several programmes which support its goal of a 3–5% deep retrofit rate, including CAD 200m for a Deep Retrofit Accelerator Initiative for large buildings (Natural Resources Canada, n.d.), but additional measures are likely needed to achieve this goal. While we have not undertaken this analysis for Canada, the CAT estimates the USA and the EU would need to renovate at least 3.5% of the existing buildings stock per year to be compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit.

The government has also been slowly updating its energy efficiency regulations for a number of residential and commercial products (water heaters, furnaces, etc) and is planning a further round of revisions (Government of Canada, 2022l, 2019c, 2019b). Often the regulatory updates seek to align with existing standards in the USA. As part of the Green Buildings Strategy, it will adopt regulations to prohibit the installation of new oil or fossil gas heating systems and will develop incentives to accelerate heat pump adoption.


## Power

Electricity generation is responsible for less than 10% of Canada’s emissions. Its share of the country’s emissions has been falling since 2015 as Canada shifts away from coal (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b). The government has committed to achieving a net zero emissions grid by 2035 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021a). Draft regulations were issued in August 2023, but will not be adopted until 2024 (Government of Canada, 2023a).

To be 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

**Coal power phase out – almost, but not quite**

Canada co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 to help accelerate the rapid phase-out of “unabated” coal-fired electricity. It has had a regulatory system in place since 2018 to phase out “unabated” coal power by 2030 and is on track to achieve this phase-out. However, this regulation still allows plants which emit up to 420 gCO2/kWh, i.e. roughly half the emissions intensity of conventional coal power (Government of Canada, 2018d). Currently only three of its ten provinces still generate power from coal (Natural Resources Canada, 2023b). Alberta (Severson-Baker, 2024).

While these developments are positive, they fall short of the 1.5°C benchmark. The CAT does not see a role for coal power with CCS for three main reasons:

- CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants
- Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.
- The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives
Since 2014, Canada has had one coal-fired power plant equipped with CCS in operation (Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam), but it has been plagued with technical and operational problems and has still not met its annual CO2 capture target (Rives, 2022; SaskPower, 2022b, 2022a; Schlissel, 2021; Taylor, 2019).

**Fossil gas power phase-out**

To achieve its goal of a (net) zero emissions grid, the government proposed new Clean Electricity Regulations in 2023 to streamline and strengthen emissions performance standards for all fossil-generated electricity above 25 MW capacity (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a, 2018e).

These regulations will replace the coal and fossil gas regulations when they come into force in 2035. They will apply different rules to older plants (in operation before 2021) and newer plants (commissioned in or after 2021). For newer plants, any emissions that occur after 2035 would need to be offset or will be subject to the federal carbon price (which will be a minimum of CAD 170/tCO2e by that time). Exemptions will apply in cases of emergencies, when fossil gas without CCS may be used, and for remote northern communities (where much of the power is diesel generated). For older facilities, only emissions that exceed the sector benchmark of 370 gCO2/kWh need to be offset.

The regulations may also provide flexibility for newer fossil gas units built prior to 2025, which would be allowed to continue to operate ‘for a short prescribed period’ after 2035 (Government of Canada, 2022j). Cascade Power, a 900 MW fossil gas plant, due to start operation in 2024 could fall under such exception (Cascade Power, 2021). SaskPower is also building new fossil gas plants to come online in 2024–2026 (SaskPower, 2022a).

While the commitment to decarbonise its power sector by 2035 is a positive step, the extent to which Canada continues to build and rely on fossil gas is concerning, especially given that the cost of fossil gas is expected to increase further, while renewable electricity generation continues to get cheaper.

**Renewables**

Two-thirds of Canada’s electricity is already renewable, due to a long legacy of hydropower that still supplies 60% of demand. Solar and wind power are increasing fast, having grown from 2% to 7% market share in the last decade. Another 15% is nuclear power, leaving less than 20% to be supplied from fossil sources (IEA, 2023). Despite this strong starting position for achieving an early carbon-free grid, under current policy, Canada is expected to use gas for power generation beyond 2030, betting on CCS to deliver on its promise of a net-zero emissions grid by 2035.

Canada has several funding programmes for ‘clean electricity’ projects, including renewables, nuclear and CCS-projects as well as programmes to fund storage and grid strengthening (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

**Hydrogen**

Canada released its Hydrogen Strategy in 2020 (Natural Resources Canada, 2020). It sees the shift to hydrogen as a key contributor in meeting both its 2030 NDC and net zero goals. The Strategy estimates that Canada could reduce emissions by 22–45 MtCO2e by 2030, representing 15% of total reductions, by supplying 6% of final demand, primarily in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050 it foresees savings of 90–190 MtCO2e through the use of hydrogen representing 26% of total reductions, by supplying 30% of final demand. The Strategy is not limited to green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy only), but includes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS.

In contrast, Canada’s latest climate plan only includes a 15 MtCO2e reduction from hydrogen use by 2030. As much of the hydrogen would be produced using fossil gas, an additional 30 MtCO2e of CCUS capacity would be needed to capture the associated emissions (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). For comparison, Canada’s only commercial CCS abated coal-fired power plant in operation was designed to capture 1 MtCO2e and has not yet achieved this target (see above for details).

Canada’s Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development has heavily criticised the estimates in the Hydrogen Strategy, finding the underlying assumptions on policy implementation and price development ‘unrealistic’ (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022b; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). One example is the assumption that a blending level of 7.3% can be achieved in the medium term: In the absence of blending obligations for 2030 a carbon price of at least CAD 500/tCO2, rather than the anticipated CAD 170/tCO2, would be required to achieve this.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has reinforced the need for securing green hydrogen production and supply. In August 2022, Canada and Germany established a Hydrogen Alliance through which Canada would aim to start exporting hydrogen to Germany in 2025 (Government of Canada & Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, 2022).


## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for around 8% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The sector is projected to contribute around 4% of the emissions reductions in its latest 2030 climate plan. While the sector is responsible for 27% of the country’s methane emissions, it will contribute only about 1% of the reductions under Canada’s methane plan. Policy action is a mix of cross-cutting measures, individual targets and programmes and funding initiatives.

In 2020 Canada announced a voluntary target of reducing emissions from fertiliser use by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, a key source of N2O emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a). Direct emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertiliser have increased substantially since 2005. The government concluded consultations on the approaches to achieve the target in August 2022, but has not yet announced the next steps (Government of Canada, 2022c, 2022m, 2022n).

Some agricultural activities will be eligible for the federal government’s GHG offset system, established in June 2022. Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS). Protocols for projects related to livestock feed management and enhancing soil organic carbon are currently being developed and ones for manure management and anaerobic digestions are planned (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d; Government of Canada, 2022c).

Health Canada for the first time did not include a meat category, instead choosing to focus on “protein foods” (Government of Canada, 2019a; Health Canada, 2019). It also recommends choosing plant-based protein more often than other sources. Reducing emissions from agriculture, including through shifting the system to a more plant-based diet, will be key to meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions accounted for around 3% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022, but 18% of the country’s methane emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Municipal landfills are the primary source of emissions. Efforts to reduce methane emissions to date have only been able to balance out the increased waste generated from a growing population and thus current methane levels from landfills are at about the same level as 20 years ago (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada anticipates cutting methane emissions from the waste sector by 45% between 2020 and 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d). The government issued draft new regulations for consultation in 2023; final regulations are expected in 2024 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b; Government of Canada, 2023d).

In June 2022, the government finalised the details around generating offset credits from landfill methane recovery and destruction projects (Government of Canada, 2022j). These credits can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS).

The Food Waste Reduction Challenge (discussed in the agriculture section) will also contribute to avoiding emissions in the sector.


## Forestry

Canada’s vast forests have historically been both a source and a sink of emissions, officially contributing a small source in recent years. However, forest fires, and other disturbances like insect outbreaks, are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting. If these disturbances had been considered in 2018, for example, they would have added another 200 MtCO2e to Canada’s emissions, more than a quarter of the country’s reported total (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Forest fires are intensifying across the country, with 2023 setting a tragic record: 16.5 Mha of land were burnt, an area larger than the country of Greece and over double the previous record from 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023a).

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c). According to its most recent inventory of 2024, Canada’s forests have never been a net sink. Canada will need significantly more action in this sector if it is to achieve such a large sink.

**Two Billion Trees**

Canada has a number of initiatives to support nature-based solutions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a). Its flagship plan, finally launched in 2021, is to plant two billion trees during the 2020s (Government of Canada, 2021a; Liberal Party of Canada, 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2021c).

In April 2023, the country’s Auditor General expressed concern over the slow rollout of the plan, concluding that the two billion target would not be met without significant changes (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). The government contends that it is now back on-track (Natural Resources Canada, 2023e), yet the programme’s website still lacks basic tree planting information (how many planned versus actually planted) or any information about GHG sequestration.

The programme was designed to sequester up to 2 MtCO2e by 2030 and up to 11–12 MtCO2e by 2050, but the auditors concluded that it will be a tiny net source of emissions (0.1 MtCO2e) to 2030, due to emissions from planting activities and site preparation, and only sequester 4.3 MtCO2e in 2050 (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Even if achieved, these emission reductions may be at least partially cancelled out by emissions from forest fires, given that several projects under the programme are used to reforest areas lost to recent wildfires (Natural Resources Canada, 2023c).

For context, Canada intends to rely on 12 MtCO2e of sequestration towards in 2030 in its base case, which includes this programme, and up to 27 MtCO2e with additional programmes.

**GHG Offset System**

Afforestation projects are not yet eligible to register credits under the federal GHG Offset system, but the government has considered allowing this in future (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020b; Government of Canada, 2021f). If projects under the two billion trees initiative were eligible, this could open the door to double-counting of emissions reductions across the two systems.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is from Canada’s national GHG inventory and covers the period to 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024).


## NDC and other targets

**NDC**

We calculate a 40-45% reduction from base year emissions (2005) excluding LULUCF and then subtract the projected LULUCF contribution in 2030. That LULUCF contribution ranges from our own estimates based on the trend over the last decade (up to 35 MtCO2e source) at one end, to the values in the government’s 2023 emissions projections (up to -45 MtCO2e sink in the additional measures scenario) at the other end. These government estimated sink contributions are higher than the government’s previous estimates of -12 to -27 MtCO2e in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a).

The reason that we added our own estimates to the LULUCF contribution is that in the 2024 inventory, Canada revised its approach to LULUCF, making it an overall source rather than sink. However, the 2023 projections still take the former approach, meaning there is an inconsistency between the government’s projection and the inventory until the new projections are published. Hence, we added our own simplified estimates and show a range within which the actually expected values might likely fall.

Canada is still considering the extent to which it will rely on international carbon market credits (‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’ or ITMOs), however, it did indicate that it may use credits obtained under the Western Climate Initiative (a regional carbon market between some Canadian provinces and American states) for compliance with its 2030 target in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a). In its latest emissions projection report, that estimate for 2030 is 0.6 MtCO2e (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

We have added these potential credits to the NDC values we rate against modelled domestic pathways (i.e. the reductions that Canada should achieve within its borders), but subtract them in the NDC value we rate against the country’s fair share allocation.


## Current policy projections

Our current policy projection is based on the ‘Reference Case’, which is updated annually by the Government of Canada, harmonised to the last historical year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

The projections include policy measures in place as of August 2023. In December 2023, Canada adopted its EV sales mandate regulations. We have adjusted our current policy projection to reflect this change. Beyond that change, we consider the current policy projection to be an accurate picture of the policy landscape as of January 2024.

The EV sales mandate adjustment is based on the estimated impact of the measure as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement and the difference between the reference and with additional measures scenario (Government of Canada, 2023e).

We do not include any contribution from LULUCF or market credits from the Western Climate Initiative in our estimates.


## Planned policy projections

Our planned policy projection is based on the ‘with additional measures’ scenario provided by the government in its annual projections data, harmonised to the last historical emissions year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

In our last assessment, we excluded emissions reductions associated with hydrogen given the concerns of Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development over the validity of the modeling associated with those estimates (see the hydrogen section in the current policies tab for more details). The government has revised its assumptions for the impact of its hydrogen strategy downwards in its latest projection, so we no longer consider it necessary to make any adjustments to this pathway. Previously, the government had been assuming that 7.5% of blended marketable fossil gas would be from hydrogen, which has been revised down to 0.45%.

Note – Our COP28 global temperature update was based on data from Canada’s Fifth Biennial Report, harmonised to the latest historical emissions and included the adjustment for the reduced impact of the hydrogen strategy.


## Net zero target and other long-term targets

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target. We use this value for the residual emissions in their net zero target excluding LULUCF (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c).


## Global warming potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Targets Overview

Canada aims to cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030. It submitted a stronger target in 2021, but did not revise its target further in 2022, contrary to what it agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada‘s NDC and uncertainties in the data for the sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.

Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).

Under its domestic climate legislation, Canada is required to set its 2035 target by 1 December 2024.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022.


## NDC Updates

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021c). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 377-494 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded. This is around 20 MtCO2e higher than our previous estimate as Canada has increased its expected (emissions-reducing) contribution from the land sector and updated its historical emissions. The range has also widened due to the significant change to land sector emissions in Canada’s 2024 inventory which casts doubts on the possibility of this sector contributing the envisaged larger-scale emissions reductions in Canada’s climate plan.

The focus of Canada’s emissions reduction target is on cutting emissions domestically; however, in its NDC submission, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Canada is working on its policy towards international carbon credits (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

* Includes market credits of 0.6 MtCO2e. Note that due to the uncertainty on the LULUCF contribution to achieving the target, we rate the middle of the uncertainty range around the 40% reduction target, which is estimated at ~455 MtCO2e

** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target. We are showing how it would have been rating under our current system for the sake of comparability.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- 12.07. 2021 – Canada submits its updated NDC
- 22.04. 2021 – Canada announces a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO2e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric.

The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”).

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance.

Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.”

In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess.

Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020.

Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely.

At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023)

To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.


## Net Zero target and other long-term targets

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. The Act also mandates the setting of intermediary targets at five-year intervals (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), at least a decade in advance of each target, and several reporting requirements. The first Emissions Reduction Plan with targets for 2030 was published in March 2022 and the first progress report on it in 2023 with more reports planned for 2025 and 2027 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023a).

Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow, nor does it outline the policies and measures needed to achieve the target. Reliance on LULUCF and other CDR in 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

While Canada’s Net-Zero Act includes some positive measures, it does not follow good practice identified by the Climate Action Tracker on a number of other aspects, such as including emissions from international aviation and shipping into its target nor committing to achieve the entirety of the target through emissions reductions in Canada.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Canada aims to reach net zero by 2050, however, nothing in its Net-Zero Act precludes achieving net zero emissions before 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target does not cover international aviation and shipping. However, under the Net-Zero Act, it is possible to amend the coverage in future. Although not covered officially in the Act, or in Canada’s long-term strategy, Canada’s updated Aviation action plan (September 2022) covers both domestic and international aviation emissions and Canada reported on its activities related to both domestic and international aviation and shipping as part of its first progress report under the Act.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The scenarios explored in Canada’s updated LTS focus on achieving net zero emissions through domestic action; however, Canada notes that it may use reductions or removals outside of its borders (achieved through the purchase of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes) to meet its net zero target in 2050.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Canada passed its net zero target into law in June 2021 (Government of Canada, 2021e). It submitted an updated LTS to the UNFCCC in October 2022.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Canada does not have separate emissions reduction and removal targets. It does provide information on its LULUCF assumptions and possible reliance on DACCS and BECCS in its 2022 LTS update. The LULUCF contribution is defined ex-ante and constant across all modelling approaches, whereas the extent of CO2 removal technology usage is defined by the models.
- **Review process** – Canada must prepare progress reports on its intermediary five-year targets. However, there is no binding obligation to achieve the targets, only to explain why the target was not reached and to provide a description of the actions being taken in case of failure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). We have downgraded our previous rating of this element because Canada’s Net-Zero Act does not require the review of the net zero target itself but rather the milestone targets on the way to net zero in 2050.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Canada’s long-term strategy clearly includes reliance on LULUCF and other CO2 removal technology across the scenarios it considers. The LULUCF contribution is set ex-ante and consistent across all models, whereas the level of CO2 removal technology usage varies across the scenarios. The LULUCF contribution is set at 100 MtCO2e or 15% of Canada’s 2020 emissions, while CDR usage by 2050 is as high as 34% of the country’s 2020 emissions in some scenarios.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but does not set a particular pathway for the country to follow or outline the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target.
Under the Net-Zero Act, the government is required to set an interim reduction target for 2026. The government established this target as 20% below 2005 levels, but does not consider this to be an official target (like its NDC), just a metric to measure progress against.

In February 2021, the government established an advisory body to assist it in developing net zero pathways (Government of Canada, 2021g). The 2021 Budget included five years of funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop and apply a ‘climate lens’ to federal decision-making processes (Government of Canada, 2021b).

- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The updated LTS does not provided an explanation for why Canada’s net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Under the Net Zero Act, the government must consider Canada’s international commitments under the Convention and Paris Agreement.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 Target Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement. Canada submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 12, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

The Canadian government announced the headline ambition of its 2035 target on 12 December 2024 committing to reducing its emissions by 45–50% below 2005 levels by 2035. Canada’s 2035 target would fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible. A substantial gap remains between the 2035 target, particularly for the upper part of the range, and the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and this divergence from 1.5°C MDPs in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.

The Climate Action Tracker's analysis excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target in order to keep the focus on decarbonisation of the economy (e.g. the phase-out of fossil fuels) and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimates of Canada’s LULUCF emissions and removals.

We quantify Canada’s 2035 emissions reduction target excluding LULUCF as an actual 39–55% reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 or 336–458 MtCO2e in 2035. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, Canada would need to reduce its emissions excluding LULUCF by 66% below 2005 by 2035, or to 256 MtCO2e in 2035.

As Canada has yet to formally submit its NDC to the UNFCCC, there is still time for the government to improve its NDC prior to submission:

- **Submit fixed, absolute emission reduction targets**: Canada should communicate a fixed, absolute emissions reduction target for 2035 excluding LULUCF, and align it with our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathways. The current proposed range allows Canada to meet the least ambitious end while claiming to have achieved its target. The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada’s emissions reduction target range and underlying uncertainties in the data for the LULUCF sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.
- **Update 2030 NDC target**: Canada should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The most ambitious end of the current 2030 target range of a 34−50% emissions reduction relative to 2005 levels (excluding LULUCF) is very close to the 52% cut below 2005 needed to align with a 1.5ºC compatible pathway. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada committed to increasing the ambition of its NDCs which includes its 2030 target. Updating the 2030 target could also be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets.
- **Increase transparency on use of carbon credits**: While Canada should primarily focus on its domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy, if the Canadian government does intend to use carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement then it should transparently communicate how it intends to use them and to which extent. Currently, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Rather than relying on carbon credits or unproven technologies like CCS, Canada should shift the focus to proven solutions to effectively decarbonise its economy and transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Increase provision of climate finance**: Canada should increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF). Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this newly submitted 2035 target into reality.

# Policies & action

Canada’s emissions are finally starting to trend downwards as the government continues to implement its climate policy agenda, but there remains a significant gap between current policies and Canada’s NDC target. Implementing planned policies will contribute significantly to closing that gap, but further action is needed.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”, with the latest emissions projections showing significantly lower expected emissions for 2030. That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all of the measures it has planned, it would go a long way to closing this ambition gap.


## Policy overview

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work is needed. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 377–495 MtCO2e level Canada needs to reach to meet its updated NDC target.

In March 2022, Canada released its latest climate change plan, building on earlier strategies released in 2016 and 2020 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a; Government of Canada, 2016b). The measures outlined in the plan are not yet sufficient to ensure Canada meets its NDC target, nor have all been implemented yet. It came on the heels of a damning report in November 2021 by Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development outlining 30 years of the government’s failure to meet its targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2021; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2021).

Canada is developing additional policies which are captured in our planned policies scenario. Of the major initiatives (regulations for clean electricity, post-2026 LDV model year standards, oil and gas methane target, and landfill gas), only the EV sales mandate has been implemented since the government released its 2023 projections. Our current policy projection is based on these projections and modified to include the impact of the EV sales target.

A federal election was held on April 28, 2025, with the Liberal Party winning the most seats (Elections Canada, 2025). New Prime Minister Mark Carney was known during his financial career for being forward-looking on the risks posed to the economy by climate change, however uncertainty remains around the new government’s priorities. The Liberals once again have a minority government and will need to rely on the support of other parties to drive forward their policy priorities.

Mandatory carbon pricing had been in effect across Canada since 2019, although the consumer-facing price was zeroed out on April 1, 2025 via regulatory change (Government of Canada, 2018a; Government of Canada, 2025). The industrial carbon price, which is estimated to account for 20-48% of Canada’s emissions reductions in 2030, remains in effect (Canadian Climate Institute, 2025). In preparation for further policy changes, the last government designated almost half of the CAD 15 billion (USD 11bn) in the Canada Growth Fund to be spent on Contracts for Difference or similar offtake agreements to offer stability to investors (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023a).

The legislation enacting the carbon pricing scheme, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, was found to be constitutional by the country’s top court in March 2021 after three provinces challenged it (Supreme Court of Canada, 2021). A second challenge from the province of Manitoba was also dismissed by the Federal Court in October 2021.

Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities. The federal government will review its carbon pricing benchmark in 2026.

The initial carbon price of CAD 20/tCO2e was set in 2019 and increased by CAD 10 per year, reaching CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. In its latest climate plan, the government stated it will increase the carbon price by another CAD 15 per year for the 2023–2030 period, reaching CAD 170/tCO2e in 2030 (around USD 125) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021k). While the carbon price is heading in the right direction, it is still below the USD 170–290 (2015$) needed to be compatible with 1.5°C (Boehm et al., 2023).

A 2022 audit of the scheme found the government had taken steps to address some of the scheme’s weaknesses, but that requirements for large emitters were poor and could be strengthened (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022a; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022a).

In June 2022, the federal government established a GHG Offset system for activities not covered by carbon pricing (Government of Canada, 2022e). Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the OBPS. At the start the system only covered landfill methane recovery and refrigeration systems, but protocols are being developed for forest management, livestock feed management, enhanced soil carbon, and direct air carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (Government of Canada, 2022c). Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recently published a draft Reducing Manure Methane Emissions federal offset protocol for a public comment period, ending on April 29, 2025 (Government of Canada, 2025). The ministry is also looking into ways to remove barriers and enhance participation in the system by Indigenous peoples (Government of Canada, 2022f).


## Industry

**Oil and gas production**

At over a third of total emissions, oil and gas production represents Canada’s largest source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). While the sector’s emissions dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic, they are projected to reach again 2019 levels under current policies by 2030 as production is projected to increase. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are continuing to rise, surpassing its total domestic GHG emissions, and sitting at about 939 MtCO2 in 2022 (Bernstien, 2024). This comes at a time when the IEA has called for no new investments in oil, gas and coal if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement.

The government seems incapable of kicking its oil and gas addiction. It has promised to set a cap on emissions for the sector, and believes this can be achieved while increasing production. Regulations for the cap are being consulted on in 2024 and are due to be finalised in 2025. They are not yet modelled in our projections. The government is also planning to strengthen methane emission regulations in the sector (see the Methane section below) (Government of Canada, 2023b).

In April 2022, the government approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject, Bay du Nord (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022a). The project is required to be net zero from 2050 onwards, but production could continue until 2058 (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2021, 2022a). The environment and energy ministers disagree over whether this will be the last development of its kind in Canada (CBC News, 2022). Whether the project will actually proceed is unclear: the company delayed the project by three years amidst concerns over high costs, and challenges to the environmental and economic assessments continue (Canada, 2023; Federal Court of Canada, 2023; Nickel, 2023; Sierra Club, 2024).

The costs of current oil and gas expansion projects continue to rise. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, due to start operation in 2024 (Calgary Herald, 2023; Trans Mountain Corporation, 2022), is now expected to cost seven times more than when the government first purchased the pipeline (CAD 5.4 bn) (Lindsay, 2021; Williams, 2023). In June 2022, a budget watchdog concluded that it was not viable and would cost the government around CAD 600 million in net losses (Thurton, 2022). Others have estimated that losses will be much higher (The Energy Mix, 2022; Williams, 2023).

Costs associated with the pipeline for the country’s first LNG export terminal, on the country’s west coast, are also soaring (Jang, 2022; Simmons, 2022). While this pipeline is not government-owned, there are questions as to whether it will be able to recoup all of the subsidies provided (Simmons, 2022). The LNG project will only begin exporting fossil gas to Asia in 2025–2026.

Meanwhile, a new anti-greenwashing regulation is causing oil and gas industry associations to scrub their websites of unsubstantiated CCS claims (Noakes, 2024).

Net-Zero Producers Forum

Canada is part of the ‘Net Zero Producers Forum’, along with other oil and gas majors: Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US (Natural Resources Canada, 2021a; U.S. Department of Energy, 2021). The forum’s stated aim is to develop ‘pragmatic net zero emission strategies’, including reducing methane emissions and supporting the use of CCS, but it does not tackle the core issue of phasing down production. Beyond holding its first Ministerial meeting and establishing a working group in March 2022, there is little evidence of concrete action more than a year after its formation. Meanwhile, investors and international oil companies continue to exit Canada’s tar sands (Morgan, 2020; Reuters, 2021; The Canadian Press, 2020; Total, 2020; Tuttle, 2022).

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)

The province of Quebec is a member of BOGA, but Canada as a whole is not. In April 2022, Quebec passed a law banning any further production and mandated that existing drill sites be shut down within three years (Government of Quebec, 2022). The move is largely symbolic as the province is not a producer of oil and gas (Canada Energy Regulator, 2022).

**Coal mining**

In 2021, the government committed to banning thermal coal exports from and through Canada by 2030 (Liberal Party of Canada, 2021b; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021b). The reference to ‘through Canada’ is important, as many American west coast miners export their coal through Canada due to resistance to developing the export infrastructure in their own country (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, 2021; Kuykendall, 2021). While establishing the ban is in the trade minister’s mandate letter, he has not yet taken action to implement it (Global Affairs Canada, 2022; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021a). On the contrary, Canadian coal exports soared in 2023, causing the opposition party to call the government to task on this issue (The Canadian Press, 2024a, 2024b).

Canada had been criticised for its hypocritical stance on coal mining, and for not subjecting a thermal coal mine expansion to a federal impact assessment, notwithstanding its position in the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Rabson, 2020). In June 2021, Canada clarified its policy position on thermal coal mining, finding that any new mines or expansions of existing mines would likely cause unacceptable environmental effects (Government of Canada, 2021i). One coal mining expansion project is still attempting to get approval, with environmental groups fighting the government's decision to lift the requirement for an environmental impact assessment (Ecojustice, 2023; Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2022b).


## Methane

15% of Canada’s emissions come from methane. The oil and gas sector is the largest source (48%) of Canada’s methane emissions, followed by agriculture (27%) and waste (18%) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The government has committed to reducing methane emissions from the sector by 40–45% below 2012 levels by 2025 and at least 75% by 2030, going beyond the pledges made in its 2022 national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018, 2021a, 2022d). It adopted regulations to support the 2025 target in 2018 but does not appear to be on track to achieve the 2025 goal (Government of Canada, 2018b, 2023e, 2020c, 2020a, 2020b). Additional regulations to support the 2030 goal were drafted in 2023 and are expected to be finalised in 2024 (Government of Canada, 2022k). The government is confident that they will allow it to reach and even exceed the 75% goal (Government of Canada, 2023d). We have modelled these in our planned policies scenario.

While strengthening its methane targets is a step in the right direction, emissions could be even higher than currently reported. Canada reports on emissions from the sector using bottom-up methods based on internationally agreed standards (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2021b). Research based on atmospheric measurements rather than energy statistics, suggests that emissions could be much higher (Chan et al., 2020; Liggio et al., 2019; MacKay et al., 2021). Canada made improvements to its upstream oil and gas methane emissions estimate methods in its 2022 inventory, which resulted in an upwards revision of emissions of between 31–39% over the last decade (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022e). It will continue to work to improve measuring and monitoring efforts as part of its national methane strategy (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26.


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions in Canada, after oil and gas, representing just under a quarter of the country’s emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). In its latest projections and progress reports, Canada foresees transport emissions reductions of 19% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b, 2023a).

Canada is taking steps to reduce transport emissions, but not at the speed needed for such a large source of the country’s emissions. A 2022 ‘action plan’ on road transport did little more than rehash existing targets, plans and funding schemes (Transport Canada, 2022a).

**Electric Vehicles**

Targets

Canada has had EV sales targets for the past several years. By 2035, 100% of new passenger car and light-duty trucks sales need to be electric vehicles, with interim targets of 20% by 2026 and 60% by 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). In December 2023, the government adopted the necessary regulations to make these targets legally binding (Government of Canada, 2023g). Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are included in the definition of electric vehicles but their contribution to the sales target is capped at 20% from 2028. The sales targets increase in stringency annually, though at a slower pace in earlier years. The GHG impact of the regulations grows over time, but only contributes to minor reductions by 2030 (less than 5 MtCO2e).

In 2023, ~19% of all passenger car and truck sales were EVs, of which 8% were battery electric (Statistics Canada, 2024). Canada should easily achieve its (fairly low) 2026 interim target of 20%.

The CAT has not developed EV benchmarks for Canada; however, our US benchmark suggests that Canada’s targets are not 1.5°C compatible: 95–100% of all US passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in 2030 should be zero emission vehicles.

The government aims to electrify its own light-duty vehicles LDV fleet by 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a).

Medium and heavy-duty vehicles

Canada has also set targets for its medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) with the goal of achieving a 35% sales target by 2030 and 100% by 2040 for some models (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). Stakeholder consultation on the regulations to make these targets binding has begun, but the timeline for their adoption is not clear (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a).

Infrastructure and support programmes

The government began supporting the development of EV-related infrastructure and charging networks in 2016 (Natural Resources Canada, 2021b, 2021c, 2023). Canada has about 26,000 chargers at 10,000 locations across the country (Natural Resources Canada, 2024). Analysis suggests that Canada will need between 440,000-470,000 chargers in 2035 to support its 100% sales target (Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, 2022).

The government missed an opportunity to support residential charging infrastructure by not including them in the most recent building codes, though some municipalities are taking action (Kozelj, 2024). Making buildings EV-charger-ready through minor changes at the time of construction can significantly reduce the costs when the necessary equipment is actually installed (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

Since 2019, the federal government has provided rebates for the purchase or lease of EVs and will continue to do so until March 2025 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Transport Canada, 2022b). In July 2022, it launched a four-year, half billion CAD programme to support the purchase of medium and heavy duty electric vehicles (Transport Canada, 2022c).

**Vehicle emission standards**

Canadian fuel economy standards for light and heavy-duty vehicles are aligned with federal-level regulations in the US (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2021h, 2018c). The Biden administration has been working on reversing the Trump era rollbacks, adopting new rules for emissions and fuel standards (see US assessment for details). GHG standards for new trailers have been delayed for several years in response to legal challenges to those standards in the US.

**Fuel standards**

In July 2023, the Clean Fuel Regulations finally took effect, though are unlikely to have much of an impact until 2025 (Bakx, 2023; Government of Canada, 2022p). The regulations require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels from 2016 levels, with increasing annual reductions through to 2030.

The regulations create a credit market for compliance, which allows those not subject to the regulations (like EV charging stations or low carbon fuel producers (e.g. biofuels)) to participate. The regulations aim to improve production processes in the oil and gas sector, foster production of low carbon fuels and enable end-use fuel switching in transport. The fuels used by remote communities, and in international shipping, and domestic and international aviation are exempt from the regulation. The renewable fuel content requirements, 2% for diesel and 5% for gasoline, as set out in the Renewable Fuels Regulations, have been incorporated in these new regulations (Government of Canada, 2010).

These regulations were first proposed in 2016 as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016a). Originally, standards were also supposed to be prepared for gaseous and solid fuels; however, these were delayed due to industry concerns over trade impacts and have since been shelved (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a; Government of Canada, 2017).

**Aviation**

Canada lacks effective policies to address its aviation emissions, which stand at 22 MtCO2e in 2019. Most of these emissions are not covered by its carbon pricing system, as this pertains to interprovincial travel only, and its clean fuel regulations (see above) do not extend to jet fuel. 70% of Canada’s aviation emissions are from international flights (Government of Canada, 2022b).

In 2022, Canada updated its aviation action plan (Government of Canada, 2022b). As part of the plan, the government commits to exploring ways to consistently apply carbon pricing to domestic aviation emissions.

The plan charts a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in which a shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is responsible for close to half of the needed reductions. In combination with increased efficiency in equipment and operations, this would offset the expected growth in air travel and bring emissions back to their 2005 levels (around 12 MtCO2e). These residual emissions would then need to be balanced by negative emissions, such as direct air capture. Around 70% of fuel used in 2050 would be SAF with a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower lifecycle emissions would increase the need for negative emissions outside the sector.

Canada does not produce commercially relevant amounts of SAF currently. In 2023, the airline industry produced a SAF roadmap which is considered an integral part of the government’s aviation action plan. The roadmap charts the requirements for this nascent technology to be able to grow to 25% fuel share by 2035. The roadmap assumes around 50% lifecycle emissions savings in SAF in contrast to the 90% reduction in the aviation plan.

Notably, the aviation plan’s four emission reduction measures are all targeting emission reductions per flight, rather than reducing the number of flights by making other transport modes more attractive. The plan only mentions a new highspeed rail network to connect the airports, rather than incentives to shift travel to rail connections to central stations in the major cities (Government of Canada, 2022b).


## Buildings

A little over a tenth of Canada’s emissions are from the buildings sector (excluding electricity) (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Under the climate plan, the government hopes to cut emissions from the sector by 37% below 2005 levels, by 2030, yet emissions have stagnated since 2005 and the last progress report’s NDC-compatible scenario shows 25% of reductions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a, 2023b, 2023a). Provinces, and not the federal government, have jurisdiction over building regulations; however, there is much the federal government can still do to provide direction and support.

The federal government has been active in four key areas under the 2016 Pan Canadian Framework (Government of Canada, 2016b):

1) Creation of a ‘net-zero energy ready’ building code for new buildings,

2) programmes to encourage retrofits and fuel switch in existing buildings,

3) energy efficiency labelling, and

4) standards and renovation programmes in Indigenous communities.

Building on this framework, the government held a consultation in 2022 on a new Green Buildings Strategy aligned with the overall 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (Government of Canada, 2021j; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). The three main goals under the strategy are

1) all new buildings to be net-zero carbon ready by 2032 latest,

2) deep retrofit rate to increase to 3–5% per year by 2025,

3) transitioning from fossil-fuel based to electric water and space heating systems.

The Strategy was scheduled for release in 2023 but appears to be delayed.

The new building codes were adopted in 2022, after a two year delay (but are referred to as the ‘2020’ codes) (National Research Council Canada, 2020, 2022a, 2022b). They adopted a tiered system for the first time, which includes a ‘net zero energy ready’ level. (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready.

Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022). While the codes are heading in the right direction, they are missing key elements: there are no GHG emission requirements, nor provisions to support renewable or EV readiness, though GHG emissions will be addressed in the next update cycle (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022; Natural Resources Canada, 2022b).

As 80% of the buildings stock that will exist in 2030 has already been built (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a), accelerating energy-efficient renovations and retrofits is crucial to decarbonising the sector. Canada has several programmes which support its goal of a 3–5% deep retrofit rate, including CAD 200m for a Deep Retrofit Accelerator Initiative for large buildings (Natural Resources Canada, n.d.), but additional measures are likely needed to achieve this goal. While we have not undertaken this analysis for Canada, the CAT estimates the USA and the EU would need to renovate at least 3.5% of the existing buildings stock per year to be compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit.

The government has also been slowly updating its energy efficiency regulations for a number of residential and commercial products (water heaters, furnaces, etc) and is planning a further round of revisions (Government of Canada, 2022l, 2019c, 2019b). Often the regulatory updates seek to align with existing standards in the USA. As part of the Green Buildings Strategy, it will adopt regulations to prohibit the installation of new oil or fossil gas heating systems and will develop incentives to accelerate heat pump adoption.


## Power

Electricity generation is responsible for less than 10% of Canada’s emissions. Its share of the country’s emissions has been falling since 2015 as Canada shifts away from coal (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b). Canada’s Clean Electricity Strategy and Clean Electricity Regulations were fnalised in December 2024, pushing back Canada’s initial net zero electricity grid target from 2035 to 2050 (Government of Canada, 2024).

To be 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).


### Coal power phase out – almost, but not quite

We evaluate Canada as "**Making headway**" on coal power. Coal generation has decreased significantly over the last 5 years, with coal's share of the overall power mix also steadily declining. Canada co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 and has had a regulatory system in place since 2018 to phase out “unabated” coal power by 2030. Canada is on track to achieve this phase-out target. Currently only three of Canada’s ten provinces still generate power from coal. Alberta phased out coal-fired generation in 2024, well ahead of its initial commitment of 2030 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023b).

While Canada's coal phase-out efforts are positive, there are some limitations. Current regulations still allow for plants which emit up to 420 gCO2/kWh, roughly half the emissions intensity of conventional coal power (Government of Canada, 2018d). However, the regulations are designed to allow for coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.

The CAT does not see a role for coal power with CCS for three main reasons:

- CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants
- Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.
- The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives
Canada’s experience with CCS at Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam coal plant since 2014 demonstrate these challenges, as it has been plagued with technical and operational problems and has still not met its annual CO2 capture target (Rives, 2022; SaskPower, 2022b, 2022a; Schlissel, 2021; Taylor, 2019).


### Fossil gas power phase-out

Canada is moving in the "**Wrong direction**" on fossil gas. Electricity generated from fossil gas has increased over the last five years, with fossil gas's share of the overall power mix also rising steadily. This trend runs counter to what is needed for 1.5°C compatibility, which would require developed countries like Canada to phase out unabated fossil gas by 2035.

Canada introduced new Clean Electricity Regulations in December 2024 to operationalise the 2050 net zero emissions electricity grid target established in the Clean Electricity Strategy. The Regulations update emissions performance standards for all grid-connected fossil-generated electricity above 25 MW capacity (Government of Canada, 2022g, 2023a, 2018e). Government projections estimate the Regulations will result in 180 MtCO2e emissions reduction between 2024-2050.

The regulations contain concerning exemptions and flexibility provisions. Exemptions will apply in cases of emergencies, when fossil gas without CCS may be used, and for remote northern communities (where much of the power is diesel generated). For older facilities, only emissions that exceed the sector benchmark of 370 gCO2/kWh need to be offset. Planned units which are under construction by 31 December 2027 and meet certain criteria will be allowed to operate without an Annual Emissions Limit until the end of 2049 (Government of Canada, 2024).

Canada continues to build and rely on fossil gas in its power sector. Cascade Power, a 900 MW fossil gas plant, due to start operation in 2024 could fall under such an exception (Cascade Power, 2021). SaskPower is also building new fossil gas plants to come online in 2024–2026 (SaskPower, 2022a). Continuing investment in fossil gas infrastructure is concerning, especially given that the cost of fossil gas is expected to increase further, while renewable electricity generation continues to get cheaper. Fossil gas in generation has increased significantly over the last five years, rising an average 5.74% per year. This is not compatible with the 1.5ºC limit, which would require developed countries like Canada to phase out unabated fossil gas by 2035.


### Renewables

Canada is "**Making headway**" on renewables. The share of wind and solar in the power mix has been increasing over the last five years, with a nearly 3 TWh increase per year in overall power generated from these sources. Two-thirds of Canada’s electricity is already renewable, due to a long legacy of hydropower that still supplies 60% of demand. Wind and solar power are increasing fast, having grown from 2% to 7% market share in the last decade. Another 15% is nuclear power, leaving less than 20% to be supplied from fossil sources (IEA, 2023).

Despite this strong starting position for achieving an early carbon-free grid, under current policy, Canada is expected to use gas for power generation beyond 2030, betting on CCS to deliver on its promise of a net-zero emissions grid by 2050. To be fully 1.5°C compatible, Canada would need to accelerate its renewable deployment to phase out all fossil fuels in the power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a).

Canada has several funding programmes for ‘clean electricity’ projects, including renewables, nuclear and CCS-projects as well as programmes to fund storage and grid strengthening (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a). However, the CAT does not see a role for CCS in the power sector, given its high cost, low technological maturity and residual emissions (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).


### Hydrogen

Canada released its Hydrogen Strategy in 2020 (Natural Resources Canada, 2020). It sees the shift to hydrogen as a key contributor in meeting both its 2030 NDC and net zero goals. The Strategy estimates that Canada could reduce emissions by 22–45 MtCO2e by 2030, representing 15% of total reductions, by supplying 6% of final demand, primarily in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050 it foresees savings of 90–190 MtCO2e through the use of hydrogen representing 26% of total reductions, by supplying 30% of final demand. The Strategy is not limited to green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy only), but includes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS.

In contrast, Canada’s latest climate plan only includes a 15 MtCO2e reduction from hydrogen use by 2030. As much of the hydrogen would be produced using fossil gas, an additional 30 MtCO2e of CCUS capacity would be needed to capture the associated emissions (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). For comparison, Canada’s only commercial CCS abated coal-fired power plant in operation was designed to capture 1 MtCO2e and has not yet achieved this target (see above for details).

Canada’s Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development has heavily criticised the estimates in the Hydrogen Strategy, finding the underlying assumptions on policy implementation and price development ‘unrealistic’ (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, 2022b; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2022b). One example is the assumption that a blending level of 7.3% can be achieved in the medium term: In the absence of blending obligations for 2030 a carbon price of at least CAD 500/tCO2, rather than the anticipated CAD 170/tCO2, would be required to achieve this.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has reinforced the need for securing green hydrogen production and supply. In August 2022, Canada and Germany established a Hydrogen Alliance through which Canada would aim to start exporting hydrogen to Germany in 2025 (Government of Canada & Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, 2022).


## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for around 8% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). The sector is projected to contribute around 4% of the emissions reductions in its latest 2030 climate plan. While the sector is responsible for 27% of the country’s methane emissions, it will contribute only about 1% of the reductions under Canada’s methane plan. Policy action is a mix of cross-cutting measures, individual targets and programmes and funding initiatives.

In 2020 Canada announced a voluntary target of reducing emissions from fertiliser use by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, a key source of N2O emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a). Direct emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertiliser have increased substantially since 2005. The government concluded consultations on the approaches to achieve the target in August 2022, but has not yet announced the next steps (Government of Canada, 2022c, 2022m, 2022n).

Some agricultural activities will be eligible for the federal government’s GHG offset system, established in June 2022. Credits generated under the system can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS). Protocols for projects related to livestock feed management and enhancing soil organic carbon are currently being developed and ones for manure management and anaerobic digestions are planned (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d; Government of Canada, 2022c).

Health Canada for the first time did not include a meat category, instead choosing to focus on “protein foods” (Government of Canada, 2019a; Health Canada, 2019). It also recommends choosing plant-based protein more often than other sources. Reducing emissions from agriculture, including through shifting the system to a more plant-based diet, will be key to meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions accounted for around 3% of Canada’s total emissions in 2022, but 18% of the country’s methane emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024). Municipal landfills are the primary source of emissions. Efforts to reduce methane emissions to date have only been able to balance out the increased waste generated from a growing population and thus current methane levels from landfills are at about the same level as 20 years ago (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d).

Canada anticipates cutting methane emissions from the waste sector by 45% between 2020 and 2030 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022d). The government issued draft new regulations for consultation in 2023; final regulations are expected in 2024 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b; Government of Canada, 2023d).

In June 2022, the government finalised the details around generating offset credits from landfill methane recovery and destruction projects (Government of Canada, 2022j). These credits can be used to reduce the compliance costs of industrial facilities covered by the government’s carbon pricing system (OBPS).

The Food Waste Reduction Challenge (discussed in the agriculture section) will also contribute to avoiding emissions in the sector.


## Forestry

Canada’s vast forests have historically been both a source and a sink of emissions, officially contributing a small source in recent years. However, forest fires, and other disturbances like insect outbreaks, are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting. If these disturbances had been considered in 2018, for example, they would have added another 200 MtCO2e to Canada’s emissions, more than a quarter of the country’s reported total (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Forest fires are intensifying across the country, with 2023 setting a tragic record: 16.5 Mha of land were burnt, an area larger than the country of Greece and over double the previous record from 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023a).

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c). According to its most recent inventory of 2024, Canada’s forests have never been a net sink. Canada will need significantly more action in this sector if it is to achieve such a large sink.

**Two Billion Trees**

Canada has a number of initiatives to support nature-based solutions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020a, 2022a). Its flagship plan, finally launched in 2021, is to plant two billion trees during the 2020s (Government of Canada, 2021a; Liberal Party of Canada, 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2021c).

In April 2023, the country’s Auditor General expressed concern over the slow rollout of the plan, concluding that the two billion target would not be met without significant changes (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). The government contends that it is now back on-track (Natural Resources Canada, 2023e), yet the programme’s website still lacks basic tree planting information (how many planned versus actually planted) or any information about GHG sequestration.

The programme was designed to sequester up to 2 MtCO2e by 2030 and up to 11–12 MtCO2e by 2050, but the auditors concluded that it will be a tiny net source of emissions (0.1 MtCO2e) to 2030, due to emissions from planting activities and site preparation, and only sequester 4.3 MtCO2e in 2050 (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2023). Even if achieved, these emission reductions may be at least partially cancelled out by emissions from forest fires, given that several projects under the programme are used to reforest areas lost to recent wildfires (Natural Resources Canada, 2023c).

For context, Canada intends to rely on 12 MtCO2e of sequestration towards in 2030 in its base case, which includes this programme, and up to 27 MtCO2e with additional programmes.

**GHG Offset System**

Afforestation projects are not yet eligible to register credits under the federal GHG Offset system, but the government has considered allowing this in future (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020b; Government of Canada, 2021f). If projects under the two billion trees initiative were eligible, this could open the door to double-counting of emissions reductions across the two systems.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data is from Canada’s national GHG inventory and covers the period to 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024).


## NDC and other targets

**NDC**

We calculate a 40-45% reduction from base year emissions (2005) excluding LULUCF and then subtract the projected LULUCF contribution in 2030. That LULUCF contribution ranges from our own estimates based on the trend over the last decade (up to 35 MtCO2e source) at one end, to the values in the government’s 2023 emissions projections (up to -45 MtCO2e sink in the additional measures scenario) at the other end. These government estimated sink contributions are higher than the government’s previous estimates of -12 to -27 MtCO2e in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a).

The reason that we added our own estimates to the LULUCF contribution is that in the 2024 inventory, Canada revised its approach to LULUCF, making it an overall source rather than sink. However, the 2023 projections still take the former approach, meaning there is an inconsistency between the government’s projection and the inventory until the new projections are published. Hence, we added our own simplified estimates and show a range within which the actually expected values might likely fall.

Canada is still considering the extent to which it will rely on international carbon market credits (‘internationally transferred mitigation outcomes’ or ITMOs), however, it did indicate that it may use credits obtained under the Western Climate Initiative (a regional carbon market between some Canadian provinces and American states) for compliance with its 2030 target in its 8th National Communication (Government of Canada, 2022a). In its latest emissions projection report, that estimate for 2030 is 0.6 MtCO2e (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

We have added these potential credits to the NDC values we rate against modelled domestic pathways (i.e. the reductions that Canada should achieve within its borders), but subtract them in the NDC value we rate against the country’s fair share allocation.


## Current policy projections

Our current policy projection is based on the ‘Reference Case’, which is updated annually by the Government of Canada, harmonised to the last historical year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

The projections include policy measures in place as of August 2023. In December 2023, Canada adopted its EV sales mandate regulations. We have adjusted our current policy projection to reflect this change. Beyond that change, we consider the current policy projection to be an accurate picture of the policy landscape as of January 2024.

The EV sales mandate adjustment is based on the estimated impact of the measure as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement and the difference between the reference and with additional measures scenario (Government of Canada, 2023e).

We do not include any contribution from LULUCF or market credits from the Western Climate Initiative in our estimates.


## Planned policy projections

Our planned policy projection is based on the ‘with additional measures’ scenario provided by the government in its annual projections data, harmonised to the last historical emissions year of 2022 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2023b).

In our last assessment, we excluded emissions reductions associated with hydrogen given the concerns of Canada’s Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development over the validity of the modeling associated with those estimates (see the hydrogen section in the current policies tab for more details). The government has revised its assumptions for the impact of its hydrogen strategy downwards in its latest projection, so we no longer consider it necessary to make any adjustments to this pathway. Previously, the government had been assuming that 7.5% of blended marketable fossil gas would be from hydrogen, which has been revised down to 0.45%.

Note – Our COP28 global temperature update was based on data from Canada’s Fifth Biennial Report, harmonised to the latest historical emissions and included the adjustment for the reduced impact of the hydrogen strategy.


## Net zero target and other long-term targets

Canada’s net zero strategy assumes a 100 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target. We use this value for the residual emissions in their net zero target excluding LULUCF (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022c).


## Global warming potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Targets Overview

Canada aims to cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030. It submitted a stronger target in 2021, but did not revise its target further in 2022, contrary to what it agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

The inclusion of LULUCF in Canada‘s NDC and uncertainties in the data for the sector lead to an unclear and difficult to quantify reduction target for the rest of the economy.

Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).

Under its domestic climate legislation, Canada is required to set its 2035 target by 1 December 2024.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022.


## NDC Updates

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021c). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 377-494 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded. This is around 20 MtCO2e higher than our previous estimate as Canada has increased its expected (emissions-reducing) contribution from the land sector and updated its historical emissions. The range has also widened due to the significant change to land sector emissions in Canada’s 2024 inventory which casts doubts on the possibility of this sector contributing the envisaged larger-scale emissions reductions in Canada’s climate plan.

The focus of Canada’s emissions reduction target is on cutting emissions domestically; however, in its NDC submission, Canada leaves the door open to supporting mitigation efforts abroad through the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). Canada is working on its policy towards international carbon credits (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022a).

* Includes market credits of 0.6 MtCO2e. Note that due to the uncertainty on the LULUCF contribution to achieving the target, we rate the middle of the uncertainty range around the 40% reduction target, which is estimated at ~455 MtCO2e

** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target. We are showing how it would have been rating under our current system for the sake of comparability.

**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**

- 12.07. 2021 – Canada submits its updated NDC
- 22.04. 2021 – Canada announces a stronger NDC target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO2e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric.

The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”).

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance.

Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.”

In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess.

Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020.

Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely.

At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023)

To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.


## Net Zero target and other long-term targets

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

# Summary


## Overview

**As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving** **at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented.**

**While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC).** **To** **quote** **the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action**.**"** **Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating.** **Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account.**

Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023.

In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures.

Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target.

Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability:

- **The new EV sales mandate,** targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030.
- **The carbon pricing scheme,** with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters.
- **A multitude of long-term offtake agreements** for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector.
All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada.

To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could:

- **Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024**, including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production.
- **Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether**.
- **Stop enabling coal exports** from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports.
- **Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path**.
Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly.


## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others.

Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”.

The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO2e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target).

The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS.

For more detail, see the policies and action section here.

In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021.

Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap.

The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating.

Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”.

Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests.

Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals.

Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO2e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050.

We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here.
