# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

New Zealand has submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once we have analysed the new NDC, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

New Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Policy overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, but it will not achieve its NDC with currently implemented policies, and plans to make up the shortfall (around two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets.

The CAT finds that following an emissions trajectory based on policy and actions, New Zealand will have emissions of 74 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), 14% higher than 1990 levels. The NDC target equates to 51 MTCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% lower 1990 levels.

CAT policies and action projections for New Zealand are based on government sources which project a dip in emissions in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and a rebound in 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). This policies and action trajectory assumes New Zealand can sustain the low emissions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as the economy recovers.

In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035. The emissions budget until 2035 is around 835 MtCO2e (in GWP AR5), 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).

Non-government organisation Lawyers for Climate Change Action (LCANZI) has pointed out that the CCC’s carbon budget is not 1.5°C compatible. A November 2022 High Court judgment ruled that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C are merely "aspirational" and the Act does not impose a legally binding 1.5˚C obligation on the government (Daalder 2022). The Court also confirmed the CCC plays a critical role in driving New Zealand’s climate action, but that the advice provided by the CCC in setting up New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget was not legally binding (New Zealand Government 2022c).

However, according to the CCC it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the NZ-ETS is fit to help deliver the outcome of prioritising gross emissions reductions. Without policy change, it is expected that NZ-ETS emissions prices will drive large-scale afforestation, displacing agriculture, and will delay reductions in gross emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022). According to one report, in 2021 50,000 hectares of NZ farmland was purchased for potential replanting with fast-growing pine for offsets (Limited and Orme 2022; Wannan 2022b).

In April 2022, the New Zealand government adopted its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050, reconfirming the government’s plans to reach net zero by 2050 and achieve a 24-47% reduction in biogenic methane by 2050.

It has put forward efforts to decarbonise key sectors such as transport and industry and has released an aligned budget. There are plans for fleshing out future initiatives to drive emission reductions in the energy and industry sectors by focusing on the following mechanisms: improved energy efficiency, fostering renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and accelerating emission reductions from industry.

In Budget 2022, New Zealand included major funding (NZD $2.9bn) to address climate change, funded through the proceeds from the ETS via the Climate Emergency Response Fund (Deloitte 2022; New Zealand Government 2022b).

The Budget topped up investment in the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) by NZ $680m to accelerate industrial decarbonisation of process heat that makes up a third of New Zealand’s energy use. In transport, significant funding (NZD 1.3bn) is allocated to cycleways and public transport (NZ $350m), decarbonising buses and freight (NZ $60m) and supporting car share trials (NZ $20m)(New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022b).

A scrap-and-replace scheme, aimed at subsidising people into EVs is also committed ($569 million), which, despite facing strong political opposition, has now started to yield results as 2022 recorded second biggest EV sales (Stuff.co.nz 2023). Additionally, NZD 840m has been committed for international climate finance under the Paris Agreement, with half of this going to the Pacific and 50% to target adaptation.

New Zealand’s main instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ-ETS) (Ministry for the Environment 2019). It relies on a market-based approach that ensures certain sectors report on, and are charged for, their emissions. It covers the following sectors: industrial processes, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, waste, horticulture, primary industries and industries involved in synthetic greenhouse gases.

Since June 2015, the NZ-ETS has transitioned into a domestic-only scheme, however recent moves indicate that the Government will reopen the NZ-ETS to international units to meet its 2030 emissions target, but it certainly aims to limit their use (Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand 2019).

The CCC published its recommendations to support the government decision on its updated NDC (Climate Change Commission 2021). The government subsequently released its Emissions Reduction Plan, published after public consultation in May 2022. The ERP includes three shrinking emissions budgets over three five-year periods to 2035, to support meeting the 2050 targets. However, the CCC’s emissions budgets do not meet the current NDC, let alone put emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway.

Subsequently, the Government passed a set of slightly stronger ERP emissions budgets than those recommended by the CCC, in parallel to ETS reforms. The ETS reform introduces a cap to limit the emissions covered by the ETS, which will decline in accordance with New Zealand’s carbon budgets based on the targets (Ministry for the Environment 2020c).

The revised ETS introduced the ability to auction New Zealand units (NZUs) from 2021, where bidders can bid for units. The proceeds from auctions were to be recycled for further emissions reduction in Budget 2022 (Shaw 2021b). In December 2022, the government increased the auction reserve price, the minimum price at which the NZUs can be sold to participants, to NZ$33.06/MtCO2e from NZ$32.10/MtCO2e (Ministry for the Environment 2022d). To regulate the price of units, the government set up a “cost containment reserve” (CCR) where it releases more units for sale to balance the prices if the price reaches NZ$50 (Ministry for the Environment 2020b). CCR trigger price was increased to NZ$80.64/MtCO2e from NZ$70/MtCO2e, significantly lower than the CCC's recommendation of a two-tier price structure of NZ$171/MtCO2e and NZ$214/MtCO2e (Goliy 2022).

Other amendments to the ETS include phasing out industrial allocations, LULUCF sector amendments, and details on the inclusion of the agriculture sector by 2025 (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). See specific sector analysis below for details.

In 2022, the government announced new settings for industrial allocations, admitting that over NZD 60m had been over-allocated to the country’s biggest emitters. From 2024, there would be no more new free allocations, with the current allocations being gradually phased out (RNZ News 2022). However, after public consultation the new bill before Parliament with the announced changes weakens them by increasing eligibility for new entrants, and increases the subsidy for big emitters (Newsroom 2022).

In July 2022, the Climate Change Commission issued its first review of the ETS, advising the government to change the way the ETS is set up, i.e. incentivising forestry and tree planting as offsets rather than cutting actual emissions, with Chairman Rod Carr warning that the ETS was more likely to deliver new plantation forestry than cutting emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022; Cardwell 2022). In November 2022, the government issued a new consultation around market governance of the ETS (Ministry for the Environment 2022e).

The government has now begun a public consultation around a National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry. It has also announced an update to the ETS that encourages permanent forests, which will begin in January 2023 (New Zealand Government 2022h).

The government launched the New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd (NZGIF) in 2018 (Scale-Up New Zealand 2019). The purpose of the institution is to catalyse investment in low-emissions initiatives. Investments so far have been directed towards distributed energy ($10m debt facility), energy efficiency ($3.8m in equity), transport ($5.8m hybrid investment and $15m green credit facility) (NZGIF 2021).

In November 2022, the government issued its first Green Bonds to raise funds for climate change expenditure (New Zealand Government 2022f).

New Zealand's planning laws were a major impediment in preventing high-emitting projects, such as the newly constructed gas-fired power stations in Taranaki. A 2004 amendment to the Resource Management Act inserted clauses stating that a regional council "when making a rule to control the discharge into air of greenhouse gases...must not have regard to the effects of such a discharge on climate change."

The same laws applied to the nation's exclusive economic zone legislation. The government repealed this clause under the Zero Carbon Act, and this amendment was due to come into force at the end of 2021, allowing regional councils - who grant most of the consents for high-emitting projects - to first establish policy statements (Parliamentary Counsel Office 2020). The delay to this repeal was extended and came into force on 30 November 2022. The government is now drawing up a national environmental standard on climate change, and a national policy statement on greenhouse gas emissions from industrial process heat, which will be released for public consultation and finalised in the first half of 2023.

In August 2022, the government released New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan based on the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment, setting out broad objectives for the country to adapt to the climate impacts already being experienced across the country (Ministry for the Environment 2022b). The plan maps out a plan of action to address risks, and will provide new policies and legislation, and embed adaptation into policies and approaches across government.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** New Zealand was one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge during COP26 and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. The share of methane in New Zealand’s total emissions is significant, at around 43.5%, but absolute methane emissions have remained the same since 1990. Around 89% of New Zealand’s methane emissions come from the agriculture sector.
- **Coal exit:** During COP26 New Zealand joined a coalition of 190 countries that pledge to phase out coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants.
- **100% EVs:** New Zealand is one of the signatory of COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission. New Zealand government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 (with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-driven cars), and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021.
- **Forestry:** New Zealand signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26. As of 2021 New Zealand’s sink capacity is 22 MtCO2e/year.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** New Zealand is an Associate Member of this alliance, which was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. As an Associate Member of BOGA, New Zealand commits to implementing domestic subsidy reform on oil and gas, to end the subsidies, end public financing of oil and gas domestically and outside its border, along with developing short and long term measures to reduce the supply of oil and gas in the global market. The domestic production of oil and gas in New Zealand is insignificant but the government has already banned new oil and gas exploration permits. In the ERP, New Zealand has included a plan for a just transition from gas.

## Energy supply

In 2020, energy related emissions made up 40% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand has set a target that 50% of total energy consumption will come from renewable sources by 2035 and has an aspirational target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of New Zealand 2016; Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021b). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is currently developing an energy strategy for New Zealand which is expected to be released by the end of 2024. The first ERP set the policy direction for reducing emissions from energy.

New Zealand’s electricity generation is a mix of renewables, coal, oil and gas, where hydro power meets a high proportion of demand (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Fossil fuels accounted for just 16% of electricity generation in 2018 (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Thermal baseload electricity generation is moving to a mix of wind, geothermal, and gas peaking plants, while a number of baseload electricity generation plants are set to be decommissioned (Ministry for the Environment 2019).

The decommissioning of the Stratford Combined Gas Cycle Turbine (380 MW) is expected in 2023, Whirinaki Diesel Peaker (155 MW) in 2024, and Huntly Coal Power station (400 MW) in 2030/31 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). New Zealand is part of the Powering Past Coal alliance and committed to no further coal for unabated electricity generation by 2030 (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In its first ERP the New Zealand Government indicated a tentative timeline for the development of gas transition plan over 2023-24, aiming to outline a fossil gas transitional pathway and thereby reduce reliance on fossil gas, while still providing for some fossil gas use in 2035 (Ministry of Business 2022b).

In 2018, renewable sources made up 83.3% of electricity generation, a level that has been high in New Zealand for decades, due to its extensive historical hydro generation, along with more recent wind and geothermal plants (International Energy Agency 2019). Reliance on hydro power creates vulnerabilities in the electricity system as it is subject to rainfall.

New Zealand experienced a dry year in 2019, where wind power could not compensate for the decrease in hydro power, and gas and coal were ramped up to meet the shortfall (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2020). In 2020, Genesis Energy imported more than 1.8 million tonnes of sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia to burn at the Huntly coal-fired power station, a ‘record year’ more than any other year and in the midst of a government-declared climate emergency (Bond 2021). Import volumes remain high in 2022, and almost half a million tonnes was imported in June 2022. New Zealand also exported significant amounts of bituminous coal over the same period (Ministry of Business 2022a).

One option being explored by the government to deal with the issue is pumped hydro storage at Lake Onslow (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021a) which would provide fast response for power system flexibility, intermittency back up allowing for more solar and wind, and dry year storage. Accelerating uptake and diversifying renewable energy along with energy efficiency will be key to decarbonising the sector (Climate Analytics 2021). Final decisions on this project have not yet been made, and coal continues to provide backup.

The Climate Analytics 1.5C National Pathway Explorer found that a 1.5°C compatible pathway requires New Zealand to be near 100% renewable power by 2030 and to phase out coal in the current decade and natural gas by 2032 to 2035 at the latest (Climate Analytics 2021). Similarly, the CCC recommends a target of 95% to 98% renewable electricity by 2030 to replace the current target of 100% by 2035 (Climate Change Commission 2021). It also recommends that coal be phased out of power generation as soon as possible and that this occurs under the principles of a Just Transition (Climate Change Commission 2021).

The CCC has recommended that the government draw up a national energy strategy to establish a coordinated approach to support low emissions technologies, and considering emissions reductions and removals; system reliability and affordability; future energy developments; infrastructure; equitable industry transitions; regional and national economic development planning; supply chains; and workforce and skill needs (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.** The CCC recommends a target of 50% of energy consumption to be renewable energy by 2035 including power, process and building heat and transport (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In November 2018, the government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration (Government of New Zealand 2018). Onshore, the construction of the 100 MW natural gas fired power plant in Taranaki has now been completed and the plant began operations in May 2020 - to be used as backup for peak periods and provide baseload when wind or hydro generation is low (Keith 2020). Further, Beach Energy has provided plans for fully developing the Kupe gas field and provide 10-15% of New Zealand’s annual gas demand and 50% of its LNG demand to the EPA, with two development wells to commence construction in late 2022 through to 2023 (Offshore Energy 2022).

The government is supportive of developing a hydrogen economy (Persico 2019). Hydrogen can assist in decarbonisation in a number of ways, particularly with respect to the industry sector and heavy freight transport. However, it is important to distinguish between hydrogen produced from renewable energy and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuel hydrogen causes a substantial amount of emissions and is thus incompatible with a 1.5°C world.

The government released a hydrogen vision paper for consultation in 2019 to inform a national hydrogen strategy (New Zealand Government 2019b). The vision paper suggests that hydrogen produced from fossil fuels may help in a hydrogen transition, but the government finds that there is greater opportunity for green hydrogen for domestic use and export, in line with the net-zero goal (New Zealand Government 2019b).

A hydrogen roadmap is currently being developed to provide a blueprint for the development of a hydrogen industry in New Zealand and help inform foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2022). The government is collaborating with countries like Japan and Germany to support research and development of hydrogen technology and has joined new hydrogen initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial portfolio.


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (mainly iron, steel and aluminium production) are responsible for around 6% of New Zealand’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, but these were recently revised upwards due to the reallocation of emissions from the New Zealand GHG Inventory published in April 2022 (New Zealand Government 2022a).

The main GHGs directly emitted by industry are CO2 (two thirds of emissions), followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Following the ratification of the Kigali Amendment in October 2019, New Zealand will begin phasing down HFCs in 2020 and cut usage by 85% by 2036 (New Zealand Government 2019a; Parliamentary Counsel Office 2019).

In the ERP, improvement of industrial energy efficiency has been put forward as an important strategy to reduce emissions from industries. In its Action 11.1.2, it outlines the NZ$220 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to replace the largest, most-used fossil fuel boilers with low-emissions alternatives (New Zealand Government 2022a). It also has a plan to support industry to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and switch from fossil fuels to low-emissions alternatives.

The government has a target to reduce industrial emissions by at least 1% a year between 2017 and 2022, with a particular focus on process heat. Based on the latest historical industry data, industry emissions increased 1% from 2017 to 2018, and dropped 1% between 2018 and 2019 (Ministry for the Environment 2021b).

New Zealand prohibited new coal boilers in manufacturing and production by 31 December 2021 (Woods, Parker, and Shaw 2021). The government has also banned new low and medium temperature fossil fuel boilers, and the phase out of existing coal boilers by 2037, following CCC advice (New Zealand Government 2022j).

The Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) is a government – business collaborative effort to lower emissions in the industry sector as part of COVID 19 recovery (EECA 2021). Since November 2020, three rounds of projects have been announced covering 53 projects, including $69m for co-investment grants over three years, and a crowd-in total of $117 million of private funding for abatement projects.

Dairy and coal industries lobbied the government during COVID-19 to exempt the coal production industry from lockdown, and coal production for domestic use was allowed to continue as it was deemed necessary for food production (Frykberg 2020). The dairy industry, New Zealand’s largest exporter, uses a large portion of coal consumption to dry milk powder, accounting for 71% of industrial use, and 25% of total coal consumption in New Zealand, coming in second only to electricity generation (27%) in 2019 (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment. 2019). The country’s largest dairy company, Fonterra, one of the biggest coal users, has now committed to phasing out coal boilers by 2037, the same date recommended by the Climate Change Commission (Piddock 2021).


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). Transport emissions are the result of heavy reliance on fossil fuels, poor fuel economy of cars, road freight reliance, low density living, and transport planning based on car use (Ministry of Transport 2021).

Light vehicles are responsible for the highest share of transport emissions at 67%, and 23% is from heavy vehicles (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand has the fifth highest CO2 road transport emissions per capita out of the OECD countries (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand also has one of the oldest car fleets in the world.

In 2020 decreased transport emissions led to a fall in total emissions by 3.5% from 2019, which is projected to a slow decline from 2024 onwards assuming increasing EV uptake (Ministry for the Environment 2021c; Ministry of Transport 2021).

Current transport policies include road user charge exemptions for low emissions vehicles, increased investment in walking, cycling, public transport, and rail freight (Ministry of Transport 2021). In 2021, the government introduced exhaust emissions standards for new and used vehicles entering the fleet depending on fuel type and vehicle weight (NZTA 2021).

However, this was delayed and, after discussions with industry, on 1 November 2022 the Clean Vehicle Standard 2022 Regulations came into force, and later that month the government confirmed the clean car emissions standard would be applicable to imports from 1 December 2022, and more widely from 1 January 2023 (Ministry of Transport 2022).

The New Zealand Government has a goal for a carbon neutral fleet by 2025/26 for light vehicle (New Zealand Government 2021c; Beehive.govt.nz 2021), with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-fuelled vehicles. However, in January 2023, the government announced a continuance of the cut in excise duty on fossil fuel, which was introduced as temporary measure in 2022 to deal with inflation (RNZ News 2023).

The 2022 budget allocated NZD 569 million towards a vehicle scrap and replace scheme for low income households and a shift towards electric vehicles. However, the plan has been criticised as yielding low emissions impact for a high investment, based on the high price of EVs and inability for many low income households to make up the subsidy gap to purchase EVs. Another NZD 375 million has been extended for modal shift and infrastructure development for active travel (New Zealand Government 2022k).

The decarbonisation of the heavy vehicle fleet is supported by the following initiatives: NZD 41 million investment to support the decarbonisation of public transport through supporting Public Transport Authorities to deploy low and zero-emissions buses and NZD 20m funding to support innovations in the decarbonisation of freight through low emission freight technologies, fuels, services, infrastructure, innovations and business models (New Zealand Government 2022k).

There are funds allocated for the upkeep of the rail transport network (New Zealand Government 2021d). The Government’s ‘electric vehicle first’ policy received $42 million for the leasing of low emissions vehicles across the public sector (Shaw 2021a). However, much of the national rail transport network has been closed down.

In 2016, the previous government announced an Electric Vehicles Programme aimed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), 64,000 EVs registered in New Zealand by the end of 2021 (Government of New Zealand 2016). However, this was later dropped by the incoming Labour Government, and replaced by a target for all new government vehicles to be carbon netural after 2025 (Stuff 2019; New Zealand Government 2021b), with agencies required to buy offsets for petrol-driven vehicle emissions after that time.

In February 2022, the Clean Vehicles Act, 2022 came into force, bringing with it a range of changes for EVs and emissions charges (Ministry of Transport 2022). It extended the Clean Car Discount Scheme from 2021. New rebates to encourage the public to buy electric vehicles was introduced from April 2022, giving an NZD 7500 rebate for zero emission cars, NZD 5000 for hybrid cars (up to 56g CO2 per km) and less for cars emitting 56-146g CO2/km (Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency 2021). The scheme has been extended indefinitely. The policy also included a tax on larger combustion engine vehicles with high emissions.

By the end of 2022 registered electrified SUV sales were up by 3.8% compared to 2021 (Scoop News 2023). To reach decarbonisation of the road transportation sector globally, the last combustion engine vehicle must be sold before 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022d).


## Agriculture

The agriculture sector represents around half of the country’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand is in the process of developing a set of policies to reduce emissions from agriculture. The government has released a draft policy based on a report developed in consultation with the agriculture sector - He Waka Eke Noa - to reduce emissions from this sector. The government claims its modelling results show this policy would be instrumental in achieving the methane reduction target (New Zealand Government 2022i).

Under the proposed plan, by 2025, a farm-level emissions pricing system will be introduced. Farmers who exceed the threshold for herd stock and fertiliser use, will be required to pay a levy that the government will set every one to three years, on advice from the Climate Change Commission and farmers (New Zealand Government 2022j). However, farmers would pay only 5% of these fees set under ETS – a 95% discount.

A separate levy price will be set for long-lived gases and biogenic methane (New Zealand Government 2022j). This policy will also extend financial support to the farmers for the adoption of technology to curb the emissions from cattle. However, this plan has been criticised for not accounting for on-farm forestry and related offsets, and relying heavily on trust and industry partnerships (Craymer 2022).

Revenue from the levies would be recycled back into the agricultural sector with incentive payments to farmers and to support new technology. The proposal was opened for public consultation until 18 November 2022 and final policy announcements are expected.

According to the ERP a new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions will be established to drive a step change in mitigation technology innovation and uptake on farms, with a first tranche Agricultural budget allocation of NZ$ 380 million (New Zealand Government 2022k).

Policies and action projections indicate agriculture emissions will decline by 2 MtCO2e from 2021 to 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). The government suggests emissions will decline due to several reasons: a decline in agricultural land use, particularly dairy cow, beef, and sheep populations; the One Billion Trees program and changes to the ETS which support afforestation; changes to farm management practices and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

In Budget 2022, a number of initiatives targeted at economic opportunities in the forestry sector, including $145 million for carbon sink development using new afforestation techniques, $111 million for improving sequestration and $91 million for stimulating greater production of woody biomass (New Zealand Government 2022b).

New Zealand has traditionally relied on the sinks from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing (Climate Change Commission 2021). The LULUCF sector has historically represented a big carbon sink that offset, on average, 40% of gross GHG emissions between 1990–2017 (average -29 MtCO2e yearly). New Zealand’s reliance on LULUCF to meet its NDC target decreased from to 26% from 35% since last year. Emission reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain LULUCF sector.

New Zealand’s “Kyoto forests”—largely exotic pine plantations planted in the early 1990s—are due to be harvested in the next few years. The platform Global Forest Watch evaluated a loss in tree cover of 1,290kha from 2001 to 2020, equivalent to a 11% decrease in tree cover since 2000, whereas tree coverage gain over the same period was 710kha (Global Forest Watch 2021). However, recent reports state that more than 175,000 ha of whole farms have been sold for afforestation since 2017 with the country recently opening for offshore investors (12,000 ha sold in 2022) (Stuff.co.nz 2022a).

Scenarios modelled by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research require the LULUCF sector to increase the carbon sink to 50 MtCO2e by 2050 in the zero net emissions scenario (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research 2018).

New Zealand has faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology has been criticised by LCANZI which finds that masking real emissions defies the Zero Carbon Amendment Act, which it argues would require a standard land based accounting approach (LCANZI 2021).

New Zealand uses a “modified activity-based” accounting method for the NZ ETS and NDC. Rather than recording emissions and removals as they occur, this method averages out the removals and emissions from plantation forests by disregarding emissions that will be outweighed by removals as forests are harvested.

Using this method can be misleading. For example, the proposed emissions budget for New Zealand by the CCC uses the “modified activity-based” method and presents net emission figures for the past three decades as much higher than compared to figures when recording emissions and removals as they occur, although the overall historical net emissions do not change (LCANZI 2021).

This accounting method has implications for the NZ ETS, the NDC and emissions budgets’ compatibility with the global 1.5°C goal.

The NZ ETS reforms introduced average accounting, allowing some exemptions for adverse events such as fires, allowing forests to offset deforestation by planting elsewhere, and delaying some forestry changes (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). The ETS allows foresters the option of using averaging to receive carbon credits for sequestration until they reach average carbon storage over the plantation harvest cycle, which raises questions around the certainty of the accounting methodology introduced, especially when the levels of removals will be central to New Zealand’s strategy in reaching the net-zero target in 2050. The other option available is to receive more credits as the forest grows and pay credits back after the harvest.

The Government has a policy to plant one billion trees by 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). The Government has so far reported having planted close to 480 million Trees as of September 2022 since the programme started, with 88% comprised of exotic species (NZ Government 2022; Stuff.co.nz 2022b). However, the programme also identified the difficulties of providing the appropriate incentives to achieve a sustainable and substantial increase in afforestation activities. Funding applications have now been closed.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from latest government data, the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 published in April 2022 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Emissions for 2021 have been estimated by the CAT. The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied.


## NDC and other targets

Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

The target for 2020 (5% below 1990) is based in the gross emissions in 1990 (i.e., LULUCF emissions are not included in the base year). The comparison calculations using the CP1 surplus and Kyoto Protocol forestry activities data is from the latest net position report (Ministry for the Environment 2021a).

The target for 2030 (Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC) is a 50% emissions reduction below 2005 levels The same target is reiterated in New Zealand’s updated NDC (New Zealand Government 2021a). New Zealand uses a gross-net approach (Ministry for the Environment 2021d). A gross-net approach is when a Party does not include the LULUCF sector in its base year (gross) but accounts for net emissions and removals from LULUCF for the target year (net). Such an approach is a logical and categorical error.

In the year 2005, New Zealand had a LULUCF carbon sink of 25 MtCO2e. However, New Zealand has chosen to exclude the carbon sink to ensure a higher baseline to apply the 30% reduction from 2005 levels. New Zealand then includes the LULUCF carbon sink in the target year 2030, which allows for higher emissions elsewhere in the economy. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the Paris Agreement as it allows for net emissions to continue to increase.

For the 2030 pledge, the CAT has estimated levels of emissions excl. LULUCF resulting from the NDC by subtracting Kyoto Protocol forestry activity emissions in 2030 from the targeted level (2030 data from: (Ministry for the Environment 2021c)).

The 2050 Long-Term Target has been quantified using the latest government historical data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). The CAT estimates the target by subtracting LULUCF and including methane emissions.

The projected LULUCF emissions for 2050 are based on the latest government projections (Ministry for the Environment 2021c). The government LULUCF projections provide a range based on “lower removals” and “upper removals”. These projections appear to be very optimistic when compared to government policy in the sector. CH4 emissions for 2017 were also available in the government data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). We include emissions from methane and exclude LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

The policies and actions projections are based on the scenario presented on the Ministry for the Environment website in March 2022 and harmonised to historical emissions of 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f).

The projections include “existing policies including a carbon price of $35 per tonne of CO2e in the Emissions Trading Scheme”.

The government projections from the Fourth Biennial Report include the effects of key quantifiable policies and measures implemented prior to 2019. Specifically, it includes the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme; Efficient Products Programme, Insulation and heating grants programmes; Productive and Low Emissions Business Programme; Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol; National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; Indirect effects of combined forestry land-use policies on agricultural land use; Afforestation Grant Scheme; Permanent Forest Sink Initiative; Sustainable Land Management Hill Country Erosion Programme; Erosion Control Funding Programme; One Billion Trees Programme; Crown Forestry Joint Ventures; National Environmental Standard for Air Quality (landfill methane); Waste Disposal Levy; Indirect effects of combined agricultural (forestry and land use) policies on waste; and the Tokelau Renewable Energy Project. The policies and actions projections do not include the NZ ETS reforms of June 2020.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its net emissions reduction target to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030 including LULUCF. We estimate that the emissions level excluding LULUCF targeted by the NDC is 51 MtCO2e in 2030.

New Zealand is in the small group of countries still using a gross - net approach for its emissions projections, despite wide criticism in terms of the environmental integrity of the target (Rocha et al. 2015). New Zealand excludes LULUCF emissions in the base year (2005) but accounts for them in the target year (2030) (see Assumptions section). While the update strengthens the country’s 2030 target, the effect is nowhere near a 50% reduction, as the government has deployed misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions to 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050.

The methodology the Climate Change Commission used to calculate emissions required for a 1.5°C pathway for 2030 and 2050 in relation to the NDC update was challenged in a judicial review to the High Court in February 2022 (Wannan 2022a). However, the High Court rejected the claim, and in its November 2022 judgment, ruled that the Act does not impose any legally binding obligation on the government to set an emissions budget compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (Daalder 2022).

The New Zealand Government plans to meet its NDC target through a combination of domestic emissions reductions, use of market mechanisms to purchase international offsets, and removal of carbon dioxide by forest offsets (New Zealand Government 2021a). Legislation reforms have ruled out using emissions carryover under the Kyoto Protocol period to meet the NDC (New Zealand Government 2020b).

New Zealand’s current NDC target is around 19 MtCO2e away from its 1.5°C compatible fair share range of CAT and is rated “Insufficient”. When assuming the entire target will be achieved domestically (which is not the case), the rating is “Almost sufficient”. This implies that not only does New Zealand need to strengthen that target slightly but to achieve the entire target through domestic reductions, it also needs to support reductions to achieve its fair share.

The gap between New Zealand’s 1.5˚C compatible domestic target and fair share contribution is around 15 MtCO2e which is similar to the offshore abatement government plans to use to meet NDC target (Ministry for the Environment 2022a). The amount of carbon market credits New Zealand is considering would allow the country to close its fair share gap. However, for 1.5˚C compatibility, the government needs to achieve and exceed its current NDC target through domestic reductions alone, which is not the current plan.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC New Zealand increased its emissions reduction target to 50% below 2005 level including LULUCF emissions, from the previous target of 30%. The updated NDC target is stronger than the previous target by 20 percentage points. This moves the rating of the target against modelled pathways from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” and against fair share from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”.

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 31 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, or 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway.

While the target is expressed as a ‘point in time’ target, the announcement indicates New Zealand will manage its NDC as a multi-year emissions budget of 595 MtCO2e (AR5) for 2022-2035, which has also raised questions as it is unclear how it relates to the target (Ministry for the Environment 2022c).

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030

New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO2e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO2e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years.

New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e).

New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021).

In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting. Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here** **.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


## 2020 pledge

In brief, New Zealand has an unconditional target of reducing emissions 5% below 1990 by 2020, and a conditional target of 10 to 20% below 1990 emissions levels by 2020. The CAT calculates the unconditional target is calculated to be 62 MtCO2e in 2020 excluding LULUCF and the conditional target to be 52-59 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.

With emissions at 79 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2020, New Zealand did not meet its 2020 pledge (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). For more details on New Zealand's 2020 target, please see the 2020 pledge section here.


# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

New Zealand has submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once we have analysed the new NDC, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

New Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Policy overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, but it will not achieve its NDC with currently implemented policies, and plans to make up the shortfall (around two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets.

The CAT finds that following an emissions trajectory based on policy and actions, New Zealand will have emissions of 74 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), 14% higher than 1990 levels. The NDC target equates to 51 MTCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% lower 1990 levels.

CAT policies and action projections for New Zealand are based on government sources which project a dip in emissions in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and a rebound in 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). This policies and action trajectory assumes New Zealand can sustain the low emissions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as the economy recovers.

In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035. The emissions budget until 2035 is around 835 MtCO2e (in GWP AR5), 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).

Non-government organisation Lawyers for Climate Change Action (LCANZI) has pointed out that the CCC’s carbon budget is not 1.5°C compatible. A November 2022 High Court judgment ruled that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C are merely "aspirational" and the Act does not impose a legally binding 1.5˚C obligation on the government (Daalder 2022). The Court also confirmed the CCC plays a critical role in driving New Zealand’s climate action, but that the advice provided by the CCC in setting up New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget was not legally binding (New Zealand Government 2022c).

However, according to the CCC it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the NZ-ETS is fit to help deliver the outcome of prioritising gross emissions reductions. Without policy change, it is expected that NZ-ETS emissions prices will drive large-scale afforestation, displacing agriculture, and will delay reductions in gross emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022). According to one report, in 2021 50,000 hectares of NZ farmland was purchased for potential replanting with fast-growing pine for offsets (Limited and Orme 2022; Wannan 2022b).

In April 2022, the New Zealand government adopted its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050, reconfirming the government’s plans to reach net zero by 2050 and achieve a 24-47% reduction in biogenic methane by 2050.

It has put forward efforts to decarbonise key sectors such as transport and industry and has released an aligned budget. There are plans for fleshing out future initiatives to drive emission reductions in the energy and industry sectors by focusing on the following mechanisms: improved energy efficiency, fostering renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and accelerating emission reductions from industry.

In Budget 2022, New Zealand included major funding (NZD $2.9bn) to address climate change, funded through the proceeds from the ETS via the Climate Emergency Response Fund (Deloitte 2022; New Zealand Government 2022b).

The Budget topped up investment in the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) by NZ $680m to accelerate industrial decarbonisation of process heat that makes up a third of New Zealand’s energy use. In transport, significant funding (NZD 1.3bn) is allocated to cycleways and public transport (NZ $350m), decarbonising buses and freight (NZ $60m) and supporting car share trials (NZ $20m)(New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022b).

A scrap-and-replace scheme, aimed at subsidising people into EVs is also committed ($569 million), which, despite facing strong political opposition, has now started to yield results as 2022 recorded second biggest EV sales (Stuff.co.nz 2023). Additionally, NZD 840m has been committed for international climate finance under the Paris Agreement, with half of this going to the Pacific and 50% to target adaptation.

New Zealand’s main instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ-ETS) (Ministry for the Environment 2019). It relies on a market-based approach that ensures certain sectors report on, and are charged for, their emissions. It covers the following sectors: industrial processes, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, waste, horticulture, primary industries and industries involved in synthetic greenhouse gases.

Since June 2015, the NZ-ETS has transitioned into a domestic-only scheme, however recent moves indicate that the Government will reopen the NZ-ETS to international units to meet its 2030 emissions target, but it certainly aims to limit their use (Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand 2019).

The CCC published its recommendations to support the government decision on its updated NDC (Climate Change Commission 2021). The government subsequently released its Emissions Reduction Plan, published after public consultation in May 2022. The ERP includes three shrinking emissions budgets over three five-year periods to 2035, to support meeting the 2050 targets. However, the CCC’s emissions budgets do not meet the current NDC, let alone put emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway.

Subsequently, the Government passed a set of slightly stronger ERP emissions budgets than those recommended by the CCC, in parallel to ETS reforms. The ETS reform introduces a cap to limit the emissions covered by the ETS, which will decline in accordance with New Zealand’s carbon budgets based on the targets (Ministry for the Environment 2020c).

The revised ETS introduced the ability to auction New Zealand units (NZUs) from 2021, where bidders can bid for units. The proceeds from auctions were to be recycled for further emissions reduction in Budget 2022 (Shaw 2021b). In December 2022, the government increased the auction reserve price, the minimum price at which the NZUs can be sold to participants, to NZ$33.06/MtCO2e from NZ$32.10/MtCO2e (Ministry for the Environment 2022d). To regulate the price of units, the government set up a “cost containment reserve” (CCR) where it releases more units for sale to balance the prices if the price reaches NZ$50 (Ministry for the Environment 2020b). CCR trigger price was increased to NZ$80.64/MtCO2e from NZ$70/MtCO2e, significantly lower than the CCC's recommendation of a two-tier price structure of NZ$171/MtCO2e and NZ$214/MtCO2e (Goliy 2022).

Other amendments to the ETS include phasing out industrial allocations, LULUCF sector amendments, and details on the inclusion of the agriculture sector by 2025 (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). See specific sector analysis below for details.

In 2022, the government announced new settings for industrial allocations, admitting that over NZD 60m had been over-allocated to the country’s biggest emitters. From 2024, there would be no more new free allocations, with the current allocations being gradually phased out (RNZ News 2022). However, after public consultation the new bill before Parliament with the announced changes weakens them by increasing eligibility for new entrants, and increases the subsidy for big emitters (Newsroom 2022).

In July 2022, the Climate Change Commission issued its first review of the ETS, advising the government to change the way the ETS is set up, i.e. incentivising forestry and tree planting as offsets rather than cutting actual emissions, with Chairman Rod Carr warning that the ETS was more likely to deliver new plantation forestry than cutting emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022; Cardwell 2022). In November 2022, the government issued a new consultation around market governance of the ETS (Ministry for the Environment 2022e).

The government has now begun a public consultation around a National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry. It has also announced an update to the ETS that encourages permanent forests, which will begin in January 2023 (New Zealand Government 2022h).

The government launched the New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd (NZGIF) in 2018 (Scale-Up New Zealand 2019). The purpose of the institution is to catalyse investment in low-emissions initiatives. Investments so far have been directed towards distributed energy ($10m debt facility), energy efficiency ($3.8m in equity), transport ($5.8m hybrid investment and $15m green credit facility) (NZGIF 2021).

In November 2022, the government issued its first Green Bonds to raise funds for climate change expenditure (New Zealand Government 2022f).

New Zealand's planning laws were a major impediment in preventing high-emitting projects, such as the newly constructed gas-fired power stations in Taranaki. A 2004 amendment to the Resource Management Act inserted clauses stating that a regional council "when making a rule to control the discharge into air of greenhouse gases...must not have regard to the effects of such a discharge on climate change."

The same laws applied to the nation's exclusive economic zone legislation. The government repealed this clause under the Zero Carbon Act, and this amendment was due to come into force at the end of 2021, allowing regional councils - who grant most of the consents for high-emitting projects - to first establish policy statements (Parliamentary Counsel Office 2020). The delay to this repeal was extended and came into force on 30 November 2022. The government is now drawing up a national environmental standard on climate change, and a national policy statement on greenhouse gas emissions from industrial process heat, which will be released for public consultation and finalised in the first half of 2023.

In August 2022, the government released New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan based on the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment, setting out broad objectives for the country to adapt to the climate impacts already being experienced across the country (Ministry for the Environment 2022b). The plan maps out a plan of action to address risks, and will provide new policies and legislation, and embed adaptation into policies and approaches across government.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** New Zealand was one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge during COP26 and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. The share of methane in New Zealand’s total emissions is significant, at around 43.5%, but absolute methane emissions have remained the same since 1990. Around 89% of New Zealand’s methane emissions come from the agriculture sector.
- **Coal exit:** During COP26 New Zealand joined a coalition of 190 countries that pledge to phase out coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants.
- **100% EVs:** New Zealand is one of the signatory of COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission. New Zealand government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 (with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-driven cars), and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021.
- **Forestry:** New Zealand signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26. As of 2021 New Zealand’s sink capacity is 22 MtCO2e/year.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** New Zealand is an Associate Member of this alliance, which was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. As an Associate Member of BOGA, New Zealand commits to implementing domestic subsidy reform on oil and gas, to end the subsidies, end public financing of oil and gas domestically and outside its border, along with developing short and long term measures to reduce the supply of oil and gas in the global market. The domestic production of oil and gas in New Zealand is insignificant but the government has already banned new oil and gas exploration permits. In the ERP, New Zealand has included a plan for a just transition from gas.

## Energy supply

In 2020, energy related emissions made up 40% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand has set a target that 50% of total energy consumption will come from renewable sources by 2035 and has an aspirational target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of New Zealand 2016; Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021b). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is currently developing an energy strategy for New Zealand which is expected to be released by the end of 2024. The first ERP set the policy direction for reducing emissions from energy.

New Zealand’s electricity generation is a mix of renewables, coal, oil and gas, where hydro power meets a high proportion of demand (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Fossil fuels accounted for just 16% of electricity generation in 2018 (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Thermal baseload electricity generation is moving to a mix of wind, geothermal, and gas peaking plants, while a number of baseload electricity generation plants are set to be decommissioned (Ministry for the Environment 2019).

The decommissioning of the Stratford Combined Gas Cycle Turbine (380 MW) is expected in 2023, Whirinaki Diesel Peaker (155 MW) in 2024, and Huntly Coal Power station (400 MW) in 2030/31 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). New Zealand is part of the Powering Past Coal alliance and committed to no further coal for unabated electricity generation by 2030 (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In its first ERP the New Zealand Government indicated a tentative timeline for the development of gas transition plan over 2023-24, aiming to outline a fossil gas transitional pathway and thereby reduce reliance on fossil gas, while still providing for some fossil gas use in 2035 (Ministry of Business 2022b).

In 2018, renewable sources made up 83.3% of electricity generation, a level that has been high in New Zealand for decades, due to its extensive historical hydro generation, along with more recent wind and geothermal plants (International Energy Agency 2019). Reliance on hydro power creates vulnerabilities in the electricity system as it is subject to rainfall.

New Zealand experienced a dry year in 2019, where wind power could not compensate for the decrease in hydro power, and gas and coal were ramped up to meet the shortfall (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2020). In 2020, Genesis Energy imported more than 1.8 million tonnes of sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia to burn at the Huntly coal-fired power station, a ‘record year’ more than any other year and in the midst of a government-declared climate emergency (Bond 2021). Import volumes remain high in 2022, and almost half a million tonnes was imported in June 2022. New Zealand also exported significant amounts of bituminous coal over the same period (Ministry of Business 2022a).

One option being explored by the government to deal with the issue is pumped hydro storage at Lake Onslow (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021a) which would provide fast response for power system flexibility, intermittency back up allowing for more solar and wind, and dry year storage. Accelerating uptake and diversifying renewable energy along with energy efficiency will be key to decarbonising the sector (Climate Analytics 2021). Final decisions on this project have not yet been made, and coal continues to provide backup.

The Climate Analytics 1.5C National Pathway Explorer found that a 1.5°C compatible pathway requires New Zealand to be near 100% renewable power by 2030 and to phase out coal in the current decade and natural gas by 2032 to 2035 at the latest (Climate Analytics 2021). Similarly, the CCC recommends a target of 95% to 98% renewable electricity by 2030 to replace the current target of 100% by 2035 (Climate Change Commission 2021). It also recommends that coal be phased out of power generation as soon as possible and that this occurs under the principles of a Just Transition (Climate Change Commission 2021).

The CCC has recommended that the government draw up a national energy strategy to establish a coordinated approach to support low emissions technologies, and considering emissions reductions and removals; system reliability and affordability; future energy developments; infrastructure; equitable industry transitions; regional and national economic development planning; supply chains; and workforce and skill needs (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.** The CCC recommends a target of 50% of energy consumption to be renewable energy by 2035 including power, process and building heat and transport (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In November 2018, the government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration (Government of New Zealand 2018). Onshore, the construction of the 100 MW natural gas fired power plant in Taranaki has now been completed and the plant began operations in May 2020 - to be used as backup for peak periods and provide baseload when wind or hydro generation is low (Keith 2020). Further, Beach Energy has provided plans for fully developing the Kupe gas field and provide 10-15% of New Zealand’s annual gas demand and 50% of its LNG demand to the EPA, with two development wells to commence construction in late 2022 through to 2023 (Offshore Energy 2022).

The government is supportive of developing a hydrogen economy (Persico 2019). Hydrogen can assist in decarbonisation in a number of ways, particularly with respect to the industry sector and heavy freight transport. However, it is important to distinguish between hydrogen produced from renewable energy and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuel hydrogen causes a substantial amount of emissions and is thus incompatible with a 1.5°C world.

The government released a hydrogen vision paper for consultation in 2019 to inform a national hydrogen strategy (New Zealand Government 2019b). The vision paper suggests that hydrogen produced from fossil fuels may help in a hydrogen transition, but the government finds that there is greater opportunity for green hydrogen for domestic use and export, in line with the net-zero goal (New Zealand Government 2019b).

A hydrogen roadmap is currently being developed to provide a blueprint for the development of a hydrogen industry in New Zealand and help inform foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2022). The government is collaborating with countries like Japan and Germany to support research and development of hydrogen technology and has joined new hydrogen initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial portfolio.


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (mainly iron, steel and aluminium production) are responsible for around 6% of New Zealand’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, but these were recently revised upwards due to the reallocation of emissions from the New Zealand GHG Inventory published in April 2022 (New Zealand Government 2022a).

The main GHGs directly emitted by industry are CO2 (two thirds of emissions), followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Following the ratification of the Kigali Amendment in October 2019, New Zealand will begin phasing down HFCs in 2020 and cut usage by 85% by 2036 (New Zealand Government 2019a; Parliamentary Counsel Office 2019).

In the ERP, improvement of industrial energy efficiency has been put forward as an important strategy to reduce emissions from industries. In its Action 11.1.2, it outlines the NZ$220 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to replace the largest, most-used fossil fuel boilers with low-emissions alternatives (New Zealand Government 2022a). It also has a plan to support industry to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and switch from fossil fuels to low-emissions alternatives.

The government has a target to reduce industrial emissions by at least 1% a year between 2017 and 2022, with a particular focus on process heat. Based on the latest historical industry data, industry emissions increased 1% from 2017 to 2018, and dropped 1% between 2018 and 2019 (Ministry for the Environment 2021b).

New Zealand prohibited new coal boilers in manufacturing and production by 31 December 2021 (Woods, Parker, and Shaw 2021). The government has also banned new low and medium temperature fossil fuel boilers, and the phase out of existing coal boilers by 2037, following CCC advice (New Zealand Government 2022j).

The Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) is a government – business collaborative effort to lower emissions in the industry sector as part of COVID 19 recovery (EECA 2021). Since November 2020, three rounds of projects have been announced covering 53 projects, including $69m for co-investment grants over three years, and a crowd-in total of $117 million of private funding for abatement projects.

Dairy and coal industries lobbied the government during COVID-19 to exempt the coal production industry from lockdown, and coal production for domestic use was allowed to continue as it was deemed necessary for food production (Frykberg 2020). The dairy industry, New Zealand’s largest exporter, uses a large portion of coal consumption to dry milk powder, accounting for 71% of industrial use, and 25% of total coal consumption in New Zealand, coming in second only to electricity generation (27%) in 2019 (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment. 2019). The country’s largest dairy company, Fonterra, one of the biggest coal users, has now committed to phasing out coal boilers by 2037, the same date recommended by the Climate Change Commission (Piddock 2021).


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). Transport emissions are the result of heavy reliance on fossil fuels, poor fuel economy of cars, road freight reliance, low density living, and transport planning based on car use (Ministry of Transport 2021).

Light vehicles are responsible for the highest share of transport emissions at 67%, and 23% is from heavy vehicles (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand has the fifth highest CO2 road transport emissions per capita out of the OECD countries (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand also has one of the oldest car fleets in the world.

In 2020 decreased transport emissions led to a fall in total emissions by 3.5% from 2019, which is projected to a slow decline from 2024 onwards assuming increasing EV uptake (Ministry for the Environment 2021c; Ministry of Transport 2021).

Current transport policies include road user charge exemptions for low emissions vehicles, increased investment in walking, cycling, public transport, and rail freight (Ministry of Transport 2021). In 2021, the government introduced exhaust emissions standards for new and used vehicles entering the fleet depending on fuel type and vehicle weight (NZTA 2021).

However, this was delayed and, after discussions with industry, on 1 November 2022 the Clean Vehicle Standard 2022 Regulations came into force, and later that month the government confirmed the clean car emissions standard would be applicable to imports from 1 December 2022, and more widely from 1 January 2023 (Ministry of Transport 2022).

The New Zealand Government has a goal for a carbon neutral fleet by 2025/26 for light vehicle (New Zealand Government 2021c; Beehive.govt.nz 2021), with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-fuelled vehicles. However, in January 2023, the government announced a continuance of the cut in excise duty on fossil fuel, which was introduced as temporary measure in 2022 to deal with inflation (RNZ News 2023).

The 2022 budget allocated NZD 569 million towards a vehicle scrap and replace scheme for low income households and a shift towards electric vehicles. However, the plan has been criticised as yielding low emissions impact for a high investment, based on the high price of EVs and inability for many low income households to make up the subsidy gap to purchase EVs. Another NZD 375 million has been extended for modal shift and infrastructure development for active travel (New Zealand Government 2022k).

The decarbonisation of the heavy vehicle fleet is supported by the following initiatives: NZD 41 million investment to support the decarbonisation of public transport through supporting Public Transport Authorities to deploy low and zero-emissions buses and NZD 20m funding to support innovations in the decarbonisation of freight through low emission freight technologies, fuels, services, infrastructure, innovations and business models (New Zealand Government 2022k).

There are funds allocated for the upkeep of the rail transport network (New Zealand Government 2021d). The Government’s ‘electric vehicle first’ policy received $42 million for the leasing of low emissions vehicles across the public sector (Shaw 2021a). However, much of the national rail transport network has been closed down.

In 2016, the previous government announced an Electric Vehicles Programme aimed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), 64,000 EVs registered in New Zealand by the end of 2021 (Government of New Zealand 2016). However, this was later dropped by the incoming Labour Government, and replaced by a target for all new government vehicles to be carbon netural after 2025 (Stuff 2019; New Zealand Government 2021b), with agencies required to buy offsets for petrol-driven vehicle emissions after that time.

In February 2022, the Clean Vehicles Act, 2022 came into force, bringing with it a range of changes for EVs and emissions charges (Ministry of Transport 2022). It extended the Clean Car Discount Scheme from 2021. New rebates to encourage the public to buy electric vehicles was introduced from April 2022, giving an NZD 7500 rebate for zero emission cars, NZD 5000 for hybrid cars (up to 56g CO2 per km) and less for cars emitting 56-146g CO2/km (Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency 2021). The scheme has been extended indefinitely. The policy also included a tax on larger combustion engine vehicles with high emissions.

By the end of 2022 registered electrified SUV sales were up by 3.8% compared to 2021 (Scoop News 2023). To reach decarbonisation of the road transportation sector globally, the last combustion engine vehicle must be sold before 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022d).


## Agriculture

The agriculture sector represents around half of the country’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand is in the process of developing a set of policies to reduce emissions from agriculture. The government has released a draft policy based on a report developed in consultation with the agriculture sector - He Waka Eke Noa - to reduce emissions from this sector. The government claims its modelling results show this policy would be instrumental in achieving the methane reduction target (New Zealand Government 2022i).

Under the proposed plan, by 2025, a farm-level emissions pricing system will be introduced. Farmers who exceed the threshold for herd stock and fertiliser use, will be required to pay a levy that the government will set every one to three years, on advice from the Climate Change Commission and farmers (New Zealand Government 2022j). However, farmers would pay only 5% of these fees set under ETS – a 95% discount.

A separate levy price will be set for long-lived gases and biogenic methane (New Zealand Government 2022j). This policy will also extend financial support to the farmers for the adoption of technology to curb the emissions from cattle. However, this plan has been criticised for not accounting for on-farm forestry and related offsets, and relying heavily on trust and industry partnerships (Craymer 2022).

Revenue from the levies would be recycled back into the agricultural sector with incentive payments to farmers and to support new technology. The proposal was opened for public consultation until 18 November 2022 and final policy announcements are expected.

According to the ERP a new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions will be established to drive a step change in mitigation technology innovation and uptake on farms, with a first tranche Agricultural budget allocation of NZ$ 380 million (New Zealand Government 2022k).

Policies and action projections indicate agriculture emissions will decline by 2 MtCO2e from 2021 to 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). The government suggests emissions will decline due to several reasons: a decline in agricultural land use, particularly dairy cow, beef, and sheep populations; the One Billion Trees program and changes to the ETS which support afforestation; changes to farm management practices and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

In Budget 2022, a number of initiatives targeted at economic opportunities in the forestry sector, including $145 million for carbon sink development using new afforestation techniques, $111 million for improving sequestration and $91 million for stimulating greater production of woody biomass (New Zealand Government 2022b).

New Zealand has traditionally relied on the sinks from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing (Climate Change Commission 2021). The LULUCF sector has historically represented a big carbon sink that offset, on average, 40% of gross GHG emissions between 1990–2017 (average -29 MtCO2e yearly). New Zealand’s reliance on LULUCF to meet its NDC target decreased from to 26% from 35% since last year. Emission reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain LULUCF sector.

New Zealand’s “Kyoto forests”—largely exotic pine plantations planted in the early 1990s—are due to be harvested in the next few years. The platform Global Forest Watch evaluated a loss in tree cover of 1,290kha from 2001 to 2020, equivalent to a 11% decrease in tree cover since 2000, whereas tree coverage gain over the same period was 710kha (Global Forest Watch 2021). However, recent reports state that more than 175,000 ha of whole farms have been sold for afforestation since 2017 with the country recently opening for offshore investors (12,000 ha sold in 2022) (Stuff.co.nz 2022a).

Scenarios modelled by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research require the LULUCF sector to increase the carbon sink to 50 MtCO2e by 2050 in the zero net emissions scenario (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research 2018).

New Zealand has faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology has been criticised by LCANZI which finds that masking real emissions defies the Zero Carbon Amendment Act, which it argues would require a standard land based accounting approach (LCANZI 2021).

New Zealand uses a “modified activity-based” accounting method for the NZ ETS and NDC. Rather than recording emissions and removals as they occur, this method averages out the removals and emissions from plantation forests by disregarding emissions that will be outweighed by removals as forests are harvested.

Using this method can be misleading. For example, the proposed emissions budget for New Zealand by the CCC uses the “modified activity-based” method and presents net emission figures for the past three decades as much higher than compared to figures when recording emissions and removals as they occur, although the overall historical net emissions do not change (LCANZI 2021).

This accounting method has implications for the NZ ETS, the NDC and emissions budgets’ compatibility with the global 1.5°C goal.

The NZ ETS reforms introduced average accounting, allowing some exemptions for adverse events such as fires, allowing forests to offset deforestation by planting elsewhere, and delaying some forestry changes (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). The ETS allows foresters the option of using averaging to receive carbon credits for sequestration until they reach average carbon storage over the plantation harvest cycle, which raises questions around the certainty of the accounting methodology introduced, especially when the levels of removals will be central to New Zealand’s strategy in reaching the net-zero target in 2050. The other option available is to receive more credits as the forest grows and pay credits back after the harvest.

The Government has a policy to plant one billion trees by 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). The Government has so far reported having planted close to 480 million Trees as of September 2022 since the programme started, with 88% comprised of exotic species (NZ Government 2022; Stuff.co.nz 2022b). However, the programme also identified the difficulties of providing the appropriate incentives to achieve a sustainable and substantial increase in afforestation activities. Funding applications have now been closed.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from latest government data, the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 published in April 2022 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Emissions for 2021 have been estimated by the CAT. The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied.


## NDC and other targets

Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

The target for 2020 (5% below 1990) is based in the gross emissions in 1990 (i.e., LULUCF emissions are not included in the base year). The comparison calculations using the CP1 surplus and Kyoto Protocol forestry activities data is from the latest net position report (Ministry for the Environment 2021a).

The target for 2030 (Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC) is a 50% emissions reduction below 2005 levels The same target is reiterated in New Zealand’s updated NDC (New Zealand Government 2021a). New Zealand uses a gross-net approach (Ministry for the Environment 2021d). A gross-net approach is when a Party does not include the LULUCF sector in its base year (gross) but accounts for net emissions and removals from LULUCF for the target year (net). Such an approach is a logical and categorical error.

In the year 2005, New Zealand had a LULUCF carbon sink of 25 MtCO2e. However, New Zealand has chosen to exclude the carbon sink to ensure a higher baseline to apply the 30% reduction from 2005 levels. New Zealand then includes the LULUCF carbon sink in the target year 2030, which allows for higher emissions elsewhere in the economy. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the Paris Agreement as it allows for net emissions to continue to increase.

For the 2030 pledge, the CAT has estimated levels of emissions excl. LULUCF resulting from the NDC by subtracting Kyoto Protocol forestry activity emissions in 2030 from the targeted level (2030 data from: (Ministry for the Environment 2021c)).

The 2050 Long-Term Target has been quantified using the latest government historical data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). The CAT estimates the target by subtracting LULUCF and including methane emissions.

The projected LULUCF emissions for 2050 are based on the latest government projections (Ministry for the Environment 2021c). The government LULUCF projections provide a range based on “lower removals” and “upper removals”. These projections appear to be very optimistic when compared to government policy in the sector. CH4 emissions for 2017 were also available in the government data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). We include emissions from methane and exclude LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

The policies and actions projections are based on the scenario presented on the Ministry for the Environment website in March 2022 and harmonised to historical emissions of 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f).

The projections include “existing policies including a carbon price of $35 per tonne of CO2e in the Emissions Trading Scheme”.

The government projections from the Fourth Biennial Report include the effects of key quantifiable policies and measures implemented prior to 2019. Specifically, it includes the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme; Efficient Products Programme, Insulation and heating grants programmes; Productive and Low Emissions Business Programme; Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol; National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; Indirect effects of combined forestry land-use policies on agricultural land use; Afforestation Grant Scheme; Permanent Forest Sink Initiative; Sustainable Land Management Hill Country Erosion Programme; Erosion Control Funding Programme; One Billion Trees Programme; Crown Forestry Joint Ventures; National Environmental Standard for Air Quality (landfill methane); Waste Disposal Levy; Indirect effects of combined agricultural (forestry and land use) policies on waste; and the Tokelau Renewable Energy Project. The policies and actions projections do not include the NZ ETS reforms of June 2020.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its net emissions reduction target to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030 including LULUCF. We estimate that the emissions level excluding LULUCF targeted by the NDC is 51 MtCO2e in 2030.

New Zealand is in the small group of countries still using a gross - net approach for its emissions projections, despite wide criticism in terms of the environmental integrity of the target (Rocha et al. 2015). New Zealand excludes LULUCF emissions in the base year (2005) but accounts for them in the target year (2030) (see Assumptions section). While the update strengthens the country’s 2030 target, the effect is nowhere near a 50% reduction, as the government has deployed misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions to 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050.

The methodology the Climate Change Commission used to calculate emissions required for a 1.5°C pathway for 2030 and 2050 in relation to the NDC update was challenged in a judicial review to the High Court in February 2022 (Wannan 2022a). However, the High Court rejected the claim, and in its November 2022 judgment, ruled that the Act does not impose any legally binding obligation on the government to set an emissions budget compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (Daalder 2022).

The New Zealand Government plans to meet its NDC target through a combination of domestic emissions reductions, use of market mechanisms to purchase international offsets, and removal of carbon dioxide by forest offsets (New Zealand Government 2021a). Legislation reforms have ruled out using emissions carryover under the Kyoto Protocol period to meet the NDC (New Zealand Government 2020b).

New Zealand’s current NDC target is around 19 MtCO2e away from its 1.5°C compatible fair share range of CAT and is rated “Insufficient”. When assuming the entire target will be achieved domestically (which is not the case), the rating is “Almost sufficient”. This implies that not only does New Zealand need to strengthen that target slightly but to achieve the entire target through domestic reductions, it also needs to support reductions to achieve its fair share.

The gap between New Zealand’s 1.5˚C compatible domestic target and fair share contribution is around 15 MtCO2e which is similar to the offshore abatement government plans to use to meet NDC target (Ministry for the Environment 2022a). The amount of carbon market credits New Zealand is considering would allow the country to close its fair share gap. However, for 1.5˚C compatibility, the government needs to achieve and exceed its current NDC target through domestic reductions alone, which is not the current plan.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC New Zealand increased its emissions reduction target to 50% below 2005 level including LULUCF emissions, from the previous target of 30%. The updated NDC target is stronger than the previous target by 20 percentage points. This moves the rating of the target against modelled pathways from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” and against fair share from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”.

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 31 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, or 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway.

While the target is expressed as a ‘point in time’ target, the announcement indicates New Zealand will manage its NDC as a multi-year emissions budget of 595 MtCO2e (AR5) for 2022-2035, which has also raised questions as it is unclear how it relates to the target (Ministry for the Environment 2022c).

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030

New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO2e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO2e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years.

New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e).

New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021).

In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting. Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here** **.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


## 2020 pledge

In brief, New Zealand has an unconditional target of reducing emissions 5% below 1990 by 2020, and a conditional target of 10 to 20% below 1990 emissions levels by 2020. The CAT calculates the unconditional target is calculated to be 62 MtCO2e in 2020 excluding LULUCF and the conditional target to be 52-59 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.

With emissions at 79 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2020, New Zealand did not meet its 2020 pledge (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). For more details on New Zealand's 2020 target, please see the 2020 pledge section here.


# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

New Zealand has submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once we have analysed the new NDC, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

New Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Policy overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, but it will not achieve its NDC with currently implemented policies, and plans to make up the shortfall (around two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets.

The CAT finds that following an emissions trajectory based on policy and actions, New Zealand will have emissions of 74 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), 14% higher than 1990 levels. The NDC target equates to 51 MTCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% lower 1990 levels.

CAT policies and action projections for New Zealand are based on government sources which project a dip in emissions in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and a rebound in 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). This policies and action trajectory assumes New Zealand can sustain the low emissions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as the economy recovers.

In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035. The emissions budget until 2035 is around 835 MtCO2e (in GWP AR5), 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).

Non-government organisation Lawyers for Climate Change Action (LCANZI) has pointed out that the CCC’s carbon budget is not 1.5°C compatible. A November 2022 High Court judgment ruled that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C are merely "aspirational" and the Act does not impose a legally binding 1.5˚C obligation on the government (Daalder 2022). The Court also confirmed the CCC plays a critical role in driving New Zealand’s climate action, but that the advice provided by the CCC in setting up New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget was not legally binding (New Zealand Government 2022c).

However, according to the CCC it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the NZ-ETS is fit to help deliver the outcome of prioritising gross emissions reductions. Without policy change, it is expected that NZ-ETS emissions prices will drive large-scale afforestation, displacing agriculture, and will delay reductions in gross emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022). According to one report, in 2021 50,000 hectares of NZ farmland was purchased for potential replanting with fast-growing pine for offsets (Limited and Orme 2022; Wannan 2022b).

In April 2022, the New Zealand government adopted its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050, reconfirming the government’s plans to reach net zero by 2050 and achieve a 24-47% reduction in biogenic methane by 2050.

It has put forward efforts to decarbonise key sectors such as transport and industry and has released an aligned budget. There are plans for fleshing out future initiatives to drive emission reductions in the energy and industry sectors by focusing on the following mechanisms: improved energy efficiency, fostering renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and accelerating emission reductions from industry.

In Budget 2022, New Zealand included major funding (NZD $2.9bn) to address climate change, funded through the proceeds from the ETS via the Climate Emergency Response Fund (Deloitte 2022; New Zealand Government 2022b).

The Budget topped up investment in the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) by NZ $680m to accelerate industrial decarbonisation of process heat that makes up a third of New Zealand’s energy use. In transport, significant funding (NZD 1.3bn) is allocated to cycleways and public transport (NZ $350m), decarbonising buses and freight (NZ $60m) and supporting car share trials (NZ $20m)(New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022b).

A scrap-and-replace scheme, aimed at subsidising people into EVs is also committed ($569 million), which, despite facing strong political opposition, has now started to yield results as 2022 recorded second biggest EV sales (Stuff.co.nz 2023). Additionally, NZD 840m has been committed for international climate finance under the Paris Agreement, with half of this going to the Pacific and 50% to target adaptation.

New Zealand’s main instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ-ETS) (Ministry for the Environment 2019). It relies on a market-based approach that ensures certain sectors report on, and are charged for, their emissions. It covers the following sectors: industrial processes, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, waste, horticulture, primary industries and industries involved in synthetic greenhouse gases.

Since June 2015, the NZ-ETS has transitioned into a domestic-only scheme, however recent moves indicate that the Government will reopen the NZ-ETS to international units to meet its 2030 emissions target, but it certainly aims to limit their use (Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand 2019).

The CCC published its recommendations to support the government decision on its updated NDC (Climate Change Commission 2021). The government subsequently released its Emissions Reduction Plan, published after public consultation in May 2022. The ERP includes three shrinking emissions budgets over three five-year periods to 2035, to support meeting the 2050 targets. However, the CCC’s emissions budgets do not meet the current NDC, let alone put emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway.

Subsequently, the Government passed a set of slightly stronger ERP emissions budgets than those recommended by the CCC, in parallel to ETS reforms. The ETS reform introduces a cap to limit the emissions covered by the ETS, which will decline in accordance with New Zealand’s carbon budgets based on the targets (Ministry for the Environment 2020c).

The revised ETS introduced the ability to auction New Zealand units (NZUs) from 2021, where bidders can bid for units. The proceeds from auctions were to be recycled for further emissions reduction in Budget 2022 (Shaw 2021b). In December 2022, the government increased the auction reserve price, the minimum price at which the NZUs can be sold to participants, to NZ$33.06/MtCO2e from NZ$32.10/MtCO2e (Ministry for the Environment 2022d). To regulate the price of units, the government set up a “cost containment reserve” (CCR) where it releases more units for sale to balance the prices if the price reaches NZ$50 (Ministry for the Environment 2020b). CCR trigger price was increased to NZ$80.64/MtCO2e from NZ$70/MtCO2e, significantly lower than the CCC's recommendation of a two-tier price structure of NZ$171/MtCO2e and NZ$214/MtCO2e (Goliy 2022).

Other amendments to the ETS include phasing out industrial allocations, LULUCF sector amendments, and details on the inclusion of the agriculture sector by 2025 (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). See specific sector analysis below for details.

In 2022, the government announced new settings for industrial allocations, admitting that over NZD 60m had been over-allocated to the country’s biggest emitters. From 2024, there would be no more new free allocations, with the current allocations being gradually phased out (RNZ News 2022). However, after public consultation the new bill before Parliament with the announced changes weakens them by increasing eligibility for new entrants, and increases the subsidy for big emitters (Newsroom 2022).

In July 2022, the Climate Change Commission issued its first review of the ETS, advising the government to change the way the ETS is set up, i.e. incentivising forestry and tree planting as offsets rather than cutting actual emissions, with Chairman Rod Carr warning that the ETS was more likely to deliver new plantation forestry than cutting emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022; Cardwell 2022). In November 2022, the government issued a new consultation around market governance of the ETS (Ministry for the Environment 2022e).

The government has now begun a public consultation around a National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry. It has also announced an update to the ETS that encourages permanent forests, which will begin in January 2023 (New Zealand Government 2022h).

The government launched the New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd (NZGIF) in 2018 (Scale-Up New Zealand 2019). The purpose of the institution is to catalyse investment in low-emissions initiatives. Investments so far have been directed towards distributed energy ($10m debt facility), energy efficiency ($3.8m in equity), transport ($5.8m hybrid investment and $15m green credit facility) (NZGIF 2021).

In November 2022, the government issued its first Green Bonds to raise funds for climate change expenditure (New Zealand Government 2022f).

New Zealand's planning laws were a major impediment in preventing high-emitting projects, such as the newly constructed gas-fired power stations in Taranaki. A 2004 amendment to the Resource Management Act inserted clauses stating that a regional council "when making a rule to control the discharge into air of greenhouse gases...must not have regard to the effects of such a discharge on climate change."

The same laws applied to the nation's exclusive economic zone legislation. The government repealed this clause under the Zero Carbon Act, and this amendment was due to come into force at the end of 2021, allowing regional councils - who grant most of the consents for high-emitting projects - to first establish policy statements (Parliamentary Counsel Office 2020). The delay to this repeal was extended and came into force on 30 November 2022. The government is now drawing up a national environmental standard on climate change, and a national policy statement on greenhouse gas emissions from industrial process heat, which will be released for public consultation and finalised in the first half of 2023.

In August 2022, the government released New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan based on the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment, setting out broad objectives for the country to adapt to the climate impacts already being experienced across the country (Ministry for the Environment 2022b). The plan maps out a plan of action to address risks, and will provide new policies and legislation, and embed adaptation into policies and approaches across government.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** New Zealand was one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge during COP26 and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. The share of methane in New Zealand’s total emissions is significant, at around 43.5%, but absolute methane emissions have remained the same since 1990. Around 89% of New Zealand’s methane emissions come from the agriculture sector.
- **Coal exit:** During COP26 New Zealand joined a coalition of 190 countries that pledge to phase out coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants.
- **100% EVs:** New Zealand is one of the signatory of COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission. New Zealand government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 (with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-driven cars), and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021.
- **Forestry:** New Zealand signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26. As of 2021 New Zealand’s sink capacity is 22 MtCO2e/year.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** New Zealand is an Associate Member of this alliance, which was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. As an Associate Member of BOGA, New Zealand commits to implementing domestic subsidy reform on oil and gas, to end the subsidies, end public financing of oil and gas domestically and outside its border, along with developing short and long term measures to reduce the supply of oil and gas in the global market. The domestic production of oil and gas in New Zealand is insignificant but the government has already banned new oil and gas exploration permits. In the ERP, New Zealand has included a plan for a just transition from gas.

## Energy supply

In 2020, energy related emissions made up 40% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand has set a target that 50% of total energy consumption will come from renewable sources by 2035 and has an aspirational target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of New Zealand 2016; Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021b). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is currently developing an energy strategy for New Zealand which is expected to be released by the end of 2024. The first ERP set the policy direction for reducing emissions from energy.

New Zealand’s electricity generation is a mix of renewables, coal, oil and gas, where hydro power meets a high proportion of demand (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Fossil fuels accounted for just 16% of electricity generation in 2018 (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Thermal baseload electricity generation is moving to a mix of wind, geothermal, and gas peaking plants, while a number of baseload electricity generation plants are set to be decommissioned (Ministry for the Environment 2019).

The decommissioning of the Stratford Combined Gas Cycle Turbine (380 MW) is expected in 2023, Whirinaki Diesel Peaker (155 MW) in 2024, and Huntly Coal Power station (400 MW) in 2030/31 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). New Zealand is part of the Powering Past Coal alliance and committed to no further coal for unabated electricity generation by 2030 (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In its first ERP the New Zealand Government indicated a tentative timeline for the development of gas transition plan over 2023-24, aiming to outline a fossil gas transitional pathway and thereby reduce reliance on fossil gas, while still providing for some fossil gas use in 2035 (Ministry of Business 2022b).

In 2018, renewable sources made up 83.3% of electricity generation, a level that has been high in New Zealand for decades, due to its extensive historical hydro generation, along with more recent wind and geothermal plants (International Energy Agency 2019). Reliance on hydro power creates vulnerabilities in the electricity system as it is subject to rainfall.

New Zealand experienced a dry year in 2019, where wind power could not compensate for the decrease in hydro power, and gas and coal were ramped up to meet the shortfall (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2020). In 2020, Genesis Energy imported more than 1.8 million tonnes of sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia to burn at the Huntly coal-fired power station, a ‘record year’ more than any other year and in the midst of a government-declared climate emergency (Bond 2021). Import volumes remain high in 2022, and almost half a million tonnes was imported in June 2022. New Zealand also exported significant amounts of bituminous coal over the same period (Ministry of Business 2022a).

One option being explored by the government to deal with the issue is pumped hydro storage at Lake Onslow (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021a) which would provide fast response for power system flexibility, intermittency back up allowing for more solar and wind, and dry year storage. Accelerating uptake and diversifying renewable energy along with energy efficiency will be key to decarbonising the sector (Climate Analytics 2021). Final decisions on this project have not yet been made, and coal continues to provide backup.

The Climate Analytics 1.5C National Pathway Explorer found that a 1.5°C compatible pathway requires New Zealand to be near 100% renewable power by 2030 and to phase out coal in the current decade and natural gas by 2032 to 2035 at the latest (Climate Analytics 2021). Similarly, the CCC recommends a target of 95% to 98% renewable electricity by 2030 to replace the current target of 100% by 2035 (Climate Change Commission 2021). It also recommends that coal be phased out of power generation as soon as possible and that this occurs under the principles of a Just Transition (Climate Change Commission 2021).

The CCC has recommended that the government draw up a national energy strategy to establish a coordinated approach to support low emissions technologies, and considering emissions reductions and removals; system reliability and affordability; future energy developments; infrastructure; equitable industry transitions; regional and national economic development planning; supply chains; and workforce and skill needs (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.** The CCC recommends a target of 50% of energy consumption to be renewable energy by 2035 including power, process and building heat and transport (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In November 2018, the government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration (Government of New Zealand 2018). Onshore, the construction of the 100 MW natural gas fired power plant in Taranaki has now been completed and the plant began operations in May 2020 - to be used as backup for peak periods and provide baseload when wind or hydro generation is low (Keith 2020). Further, Beach Energy has provided plans for fully developing the Kupe gas field and provide 10-15% of New Zealand’s annual gas demand and 50% of its LNG demand to the EPA, with two development wells to commence construction in late 2022 through to 2023 (Offshore Energy 2022).

The government is supportive of developing a hydrogen economy (Persico 2019). Hydrogen can assist in decarbonisation in a number of ways, particularly with respect to the industry sector and heavy freight transport. However, it is important to distinguish between hydrogen produced from renewable energy and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuel hydrogen causes a substantial amount of emissions and is thus incompatible with a 1.5°C world.

The government released a hydrogen vision paper for consultation in 2019 to inform a national hydrogen strategy (New Zealand Government 2019b). The vision paper suggests that hydrogen produced from fossil fuels may help in a hydrogen transition, but the government finds that there is greater opportunity for green hydrogen for domestic use and export, in line with the net-zero goal (New Zealand Government 2019b).

A hydrogen roadmap is currently being developed to provide a blueprint for the development of a hydrogen industry in New Zealand and help inform foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2022). The government is collaborating with countries like Japan and Germany to support research and development of hydrogen technology and has joined new hydrogen initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial portfolio.


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (mainly iron, steel and aluminium production) are responsible for around 6% of New Zealand’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, but these were recently revised upwards due to the reallocation of emissions from the New Zealand GHG Inventory published in April 2022 (New Zealand Government 2022a).

The main GHGs directly emitted by industry are CO2 (two thirds of emissions), followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Following the ratification of the Kigali Amendment in October 2019, New Zealand will begin phasing down HFCs in 2020 and cut usage by 85% by 2036 (New Zealand Government 2019a; Parliamentary Counsel Office 2019).

In the ERP, improvement of industrial energy efficiency has been put forward as an important strategy to reduce emissions from industries. In its Action 11.1.2, it outlines the NZ$220 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to replace the largest, most-used fossil fuel boilers with low-emissions alternatives (New Zealand Government 2022a). It also has a plan to support industry to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and switch from fossil fuels to low-emissions alternatives.

The government has a target to reduce industrial emissions by at least 1% a year between 2017 and 2022, with a particular focus on process heat. Based on the latest historical industry data, industry emissions increased 1% from 2017 to 2018, and dropped 1% between 2018 and 2019 (Ministry for the Environment 2021b).

New Zealand prohibited new coal boilers in manufacturing and production by 31 December 2021 (Woods, Parker, and Shaw 2021). The government has also banned new low and medium temperature fossil fuel boilers, and the phase out of existing coal boilers by 2037, following CCC advice (New Zealand Government 2022j).

The Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) is a government – business collaborative effort to lower emissions in the industry sector as part of COVID 19 recovery (EECA 2021). Since November 2020, three rounds of projects have been announced covering 53 projects, including $69m for co-investment grants over three years, and a crowd-in total of $117 million of private funding for abatement projects.

Dairy and coal industries lobbied the government during COVID-19 to exempt the coal production industry from lockdown, and coal production for domestic use was allowed to continue as it was deemed necessary for food production (Frykberg 2020). The dairy industry, New Zealand’s largest exporter, uses a large portion of coal consumption to dry milk powder, accounting for 71% of industrial use, and 25% of total coal consumption in New Zealand, coming in second only to electricity generation (27%) in 2019 (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment. 2019). The country’s largest dairy company, Fonterra, one of the biggest coal users, has now committed to phasing out coal boilers by 2037, the same date recommended by the Climate Change Commission (Piddock 2021).


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). Transport emissions are the result of heavy reliance on fossil fuels, poor fuel economy of cars, road freight reliance, low density living, and transport planning based on car use (Ministry of Transport 2021).

Light vehicles are responsible for the highest share of transport emissions at 67%, and 23% is from heavy vehicles (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand has the fifth highest CO2 road transport emissions per capita out of the OECD countries (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand also has one of the oldest car fleets in the world.

In 2020 decreased transport emissions led to a fall in total emissions by 3.5% from 2019, which is projected to a slow decline from 2024 onwards assuming increasing EV uptake (Ministry for the Environment 2021c; Ministry of Transport 2021).

Current transport policies include road user charge exemptions for low emissions vehicles, increased investment in walking, cycling, public transport, and rail freight (Ministry of Transport 2021). In 2021, the government introduced exhaust emissions standards for new and used vehicles entering the fleet depending on fuel type and vehicle weight (NZTA 2021).

However, this was delayed and, after discussions with industry, on 1 November 2022 the Clean Vehicle Standard 2022 Regulations came into force, and later that month the government confirmed the clean car emissions standard would be applicable to imports from 1 December 2022, and more widely from 1 January 2023 (Ministry of Transport 2022).

The New Zealand Government has a goal for a carbon neutral fleet by 2025/26 for light vehicle (New Zealand Government 2021c; Beehive.govt.nz 2021), with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-fuelled vehicles. However, in January 2023, the government announced a continuance of the cut in excise duty on fossil fuel, which was introduced as temporary measure in 2022 to deal with inflation (RNZ News 2023).

The 2022 budget allocated NZD 569 million towards a vehicle scrap and replace scheme for low income households and a shift towards electric vehicles. However, the plan has been criticised as yielding low emissions impact for a high investment, based on the high price of EVs and inability for many low income households to make up the subsidy gap to purchase EVs. Another NZD 375 million has been extended for modal shift and infrastructure development for active travel (New Zealand Government 2022k).

The decarbonisation of the heavy vehicle fleet is supported by the following initiatives: NZD 41 million investment to support the decarbonisation of public transport through supporting Public Transport Authorities to deploy low and zero-emissions buses and NZD 20m funding to support innovations in the decarbonisation of freight through low emission freight technologies, fuels, services, infrastructure, innovations and business models (New Zealand Government 2022k).

There are funds allocated for the upkeep of the rail transport network (New Zealand Government 2021d). The Government’s ‘electric vehicle first’ policy received $42 million for the leasing of low emissions vehicles across the public sector (Shaw 2021a). However, much of the national rail transport network has been closed down.

In 2016, the previous government announced an Electric Vehicles Programme aimed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), 64,000 EVs registered in New Zealand by the end of 2021 (Government of New Zealand 2016). However, this was later dropped by the incoming Labour Government, and replaced by a target for all new government vehicles to be carbon netural after 2025 (Stuff 2019; New Zealand Government 2021b), with agencies required to buy offsets for petrol-driven vehicle emissions after that time.

In February 2022, the Clean Vehicles Act, 2022 came into force, bringing with it a range of changes for EVs and emissions charges (Ministry of Transport 2022). It extended the Clean Car Discount Scheme from 2021. New rebates to encourage the public to buy electric vehicles was introduced from April 2022, giving an NZD 7500 rebate for zero emission cars, NZD 5000 for hybrid cars (up to 56g CO2 per km) and less for cars emitting 56-146g CO2/km (Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency 2021). The scheme has been extended indefinitely. The policy also included a tax on larger combustion engine vehicles with high emissions.

By the end of 2022 registered electrified SUV sales were up by 3.8% compared to 2021 (Scoop News 2023). To reach decarbonisation of the road transportation sector globally, the last combustion engine vehicle must be sold before 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022d).


## Agriculture

The agriculture sector represents around half of the country’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand is in the process of developing a set of policies to reduce emissions from agriculture. The government has released a draft policy based on a report developed in consultation with the agriculture sector - He Waka Eke Noa - to reduce emissions from this sector. The government claims its modelling results show this policy would be instrumental in achieving the methane reduction target (New Zealand Government 2022i).

Under the proposed plan, by 2025, a farm-level emissions pricing system will be introduced. Farmers who exceed the threshold for herd stock and fertiliser use, will be required to pay a levy that the government will set every one to three years, on advice from the Climate Change Commission and farmers (New Zealand Government 2022j). However, farmers would pay only 5% of these fees set under ETS – a 95% discount.

A separate levy price will be set for long-lived gases and biogenic methane (New Zealand Government 2022j). This policy will also extend financial support to the farmers for the adoption of technology to curb the emissions from cattle. However, this plan has been criticised for not accounting for on-farm forestry and related offsets, and relying heavily on trust and industry partnerships (Craymer 2022).

Revenue from the levies would be recycled back into the agricultural sector with incentive payments to farmers and to support new technology. The proposal was opened for public consultation until 18 November 2022 and final policy announcements are expected.

According to the ERP a new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions will be established to drive a step change in mitigation technology innovation and uptake on farms, with a first tranche Agricultural budget allocation of NZ$ 380 million (New Zealand Government 2022k).

Policies and action projections indicate agriculture emissions will decline by 2 MtCO2e from 2021 to 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). The government suggests emissions will decline due to several reasons: a decline in agricultural land use, particularly dairy cow, beef, and sheep populations; the One Billion Trees program and changes to the ETS which support afforestation; changes to farm management practices and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

In Budget 2022, a number of initiatives targeted at economic opportunities in the forestry sector, including $145 million for carbon sink development using new afforestation techniques, $111 million for improving sequestration and $91 million for stimulating greater production of woody biomass (New Zealand Government 2022b).

New Zealand has traditionally relied on the sinks from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing (Climate Change Commission 2021). The LULUCF sector has historically represented a big carbon sink that offset, on average, 40% of gross GHG emissions between 1990–2017 (average -29 MtCO2e yearly). New Zealand’s reliance on LULUCF to meet its NDC target decreased from to 26% from 35% since last year. Emission reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain LULUCF sector.

New Zealand’s “Kyoto forests”—largely exotic pine plantations planted in the early 1990s—are due to be harvested in the next few years. The platform Global Forest Watch evaluated a loss in tree cover of 1,290kha from 2001 to 2020, equivalent to a 11% decrease in tree cover since 2000, whereas tree coverage gain over the same period was 710kha (Global Forest Watch 2021). However, recent reports state that more than 175,000 ha of whole farms have been sold for afforestation since 2017 with the country recently opening for offshore investors (12,000 ha sold in 2022) (Stuff.co.nz 2022a).

Scenarios modelled by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research require the LULUCF sector to increase the carbon sink to 50 MtCO2e by 2050 in the zero net emissions scenario (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research 2018).

New Zealand has faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology has been criticised by LCANZI which finds that masking real emissions defies the Zero Carbon Amendment Act, which it argues would require a standard land based accounting approach (LCANZI 2021).

New Zealand uses a “modified activity-based” accounting method for the NZ ETS and NDC. Rather than recording emissions and removals as they occur, this method averages out the removals and emissions from plantation forests by disregarding emissions that will be outweighed by removals as forests are harvested.

Using this method can be misleading. For example, the proposed emissions budget for New Zealand by the CCC uses the “modified activity-based” method and presents net emission figures for the past three decades as much higher than compared to figures when recording emissions and removals as they occur, although the overall historical net emissions do not change (LCANZI 2021).

This accounting method has implications for the NZ ETS, the NDC and emissions budgets’ compatibility with the global 1.5°C goal.

The NZ ETS reforms introduced average accounting, allowing some exemptions for adverse events such as fires, allowing forests to offset deforestation by planting elsewhere, and delaying some forestry changes (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). The ETS allows foresters the option of using averaging to receive carbon credits for sequestration until they reach average carbon storage over the plantation harvest cycle, which raises questions around the certainty of the accounting methodology introduced, especially when the levels of removals will be central to New Zealand’s strategy in reaching the net-zero target in 2050. The other option available is to receive more credits as the forest grows and pay credits back after the harvest.

The Government has a policy to plant one billion trees by 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). The Government has so far reported having planted close to 480 million Trees as of September 2022 since the programme started, with 88% comprised of exotic species (NZ Government 2022; Stuff.co.nz 2022b). However, the programme also identified the difficulties of providing the appropriate incentives to achieve a sustainable and substantial increase in afforestation activities. Funding applications have now been closed.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from latest government data, the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 published in April 2022 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Emissions for 2021 have been estimated by the CAT. The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied.


## NDC and other targets

Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

The target for 2020 (5% below 1990) is based in the gross emissions in 1990 (i.e., LULUCF emissions are not included in the base year). The comparison calculations using the CP1 surplus and Kyoto Protocol forestry activities data is from the latest net position report (Ministry for the Environment 2021a).

The target for 2030 (Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC) is a 50% emissions reduction below 2005 levels The same target is reiterated in New Zealand’s updated NDC (New Zealand Government 2021a). New Zealand uses a gross-net approach (Ministry for the Environment 2021d). A gross-net approach is when a Party does not include the LULUCF sector in its base year (gross) but accounts for net emissions and removals from LULUCF for the target year (net). Such an approach is a logical and categorical error.

In the year 2005, New Zealand had a LULUCF carbon sink of 25 MtCO2e. However, New Zealand has chosen to exclude the carbon sink to ensure a higher baseline to apply the 30% reduction from 2005 levels. New Zealand then includes the LULUCF carbon sink in the target year 2030, which allows for higher emissions elsewhere in the economy. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the Paris Agreement as it allows for net emissions to continue to increase.

For the 2030 pledge, the CAT has estimated levels of emissions excl. LULUCF resulting from the NDC by subtracting Kyoto Protocol forestry activity emissions in 2030 from the targeted level (2030 data from: (Ministry for the Environment 2021c)).

The 2050 Long-Term Target has been quantified using the latest government historical data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). The CAT estimates the target by subtracting LULUCF and including methane emissions.

The projected LULUCF emissions for 2050 are based on the latest government projections (Ministry for the Environment 2021c). The government LULUCF projections provide a range based on “lower removals” and “upper removals”. These projections appear to be very optimistic when compared to government policy in the sector. CH4 emissions for 2017 were also available in the government data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). We include emissions from methane and exclude LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

The policies and actions projections are based on the scenario presented on the Ministry for the Environment website in March 2022 and harmonised to historical emissions of 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f).

The projections include “existing policies including a carbon price of $35 per tonne of CO2e in the Emissions Trading Scheme”.

The government projections from the Fourth Biennial Report include the effects of key quantifiable policies and measures implemented prior to 2019. Specifically, it includes the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme; Efficient Products Programme, Insulation and heating grants programmes; Productive and Low Emissions Business Programme; Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol; National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; Indirect effects of combined forestry land-use policies on agricultural land use; Afforestation Grant Scheme; Permanent Forest Sink Initiative; Sustainable Land Management Hill Country Erosion Programme; Erosion Control Funding Programme; One Billion Trees Programme; Crown Forestry Joint Ventures; National Environmental Standard for Air Quality (landfill methane); Waste Disposal Levy; Indirect effects of combined agricultural (forestry and land use) policies on waste; and the Tokelau Renewable Energy Project. The policies and actions projections do not include the NZ ETS reforms of June 2020.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its net emissions reduction target to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030 including LULUCF. We estimate that the emissions level excluding LULUCF targeted by the NDC is 51 MtCO2e in 2030.

New Zealand is in the small group of countries still using a gross - net approach for its emissions projections, despite wide criticism in terms of the environmental integrity of the target (Rocha et al. 2015). New Zealand excludes LULUCF emissions in the base year (2005) but accounts for them in the target year (2030) (see Assumptions section). While the update strengthens the country’s 2030 target, the effect is nowhere near a 50% reduction, as the government has deployed misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions to 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050.

The methodology the Climate Change Commission used to calculate emissions required for a 1.5°C pathway for 2030 and 2050 in relation to the NDC update was challenged in a judicial review to the High Court in February 2022 (Wannan 2022a). However, the High Court rejected the claim, and in its November 2022 judgment, ruled that the Act does not impose any legally binding obligation on the government to set an emissions budget compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (Daalder 2022).

The New Zealand Government plans to meet its NDC target through a combination of domestic emissions reductions, use of market mechanisms to purchase international offsets, and removal of carbon dioxide by forest offsets (New Zealand Government 2021a). Legislation reforms have ruled out using emissions carryover under the Kyoto Protocol period to meet the NDC (New Zealand Government 2020b).

New Zealand’s current NDC target is around 19 MtCO2e away from its 1.5°C compatible fair share range of CAT and is rated “Insufficient”. When assuming the entire target will be achieved domestically (which is not the case), the rating is “Almost sufficient”. This implies that not only does New Zealand need to strengthen that target slightly but to achieve the entire target through domestic reductions, it also needs to support reductions to achieve its fair share.

The gap between New Zealand’s 1.5˚C compatible domestic target and fair share contribution is around 15 MtCO2e which is similar to the offshore abatement government plans to use to meet NDC target (Ministry for the Environment 2022a). The amount of carbon market credits New Zealand is considering would allow the country to close its fair share gap. However, for 1.5˚C compatibility, the government needs to achieve and exceed its current NDC target through domestic reductions alone, which is not the current plan.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC New Zealand increased its emissions reduction target to 50% below 2005 level including LULUCF emissions, from the previous target of 30%. The updated NDC target is stronger than the previous target by 20 percentage points. This moves the rating of the target against modelled pathways from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” and against fair share from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”.

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 31 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, or 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway.

While the target is expressed as a ‘point in time’ target, the announcement indicates New Zealand will manage its NDC as a multi-year emissions budget of 595 MtCO2e (AR5) for 2022-2035, which has also raised questions as it is unclear how it relates to the target (Ministry for the Environment 2022c).

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030

New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO2e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO2e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years.

New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e).

New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021).

In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting. Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here** **.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


## 2020 pledge

In brief, New Zealand has an unconditional target of reducing emissions 5% below 1990 by 2020, and a conditional target of 10 to 20% below 1990 emissions levels by 2020. The CAT calculates the unconditional target is calculated to be 62 MtCO2e in 2020 excluding LULUCF and the conditional target to be 52-59 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.

With emissions at 79 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2020, New Zealand did not meet its 2020 pledge (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). For more details on New Zealand's 2020 target, please see the 2020 pledge section here.


# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

New Zealand has submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once we have analysed the new NDC, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

New Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Policy overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, but it will not achieve its NDC with currently implemented policies, and plans to make up the shortfall (around two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets.

The CAT finds that following an emissions trajectory based on policy and actions, New Zealand will have emissions of 74 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), 14% higher than 1990 levels. The NDC target equates to 51 MTCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% lower 1990 levels.

CAT policies and action projections for New Zealand are based on government sources which project a dip in emissions in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and a rebound in 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). This policies and action trajectory assumes New Zealand can sustain the low emissions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as the economy recovers.

In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035. The emissions budget until 2035 is around 835 MtCO2e (in GWP AR5), 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).

Non-government organisation Lawyers for Climate Change Action (LCANZI) has pointed out that the CCC’s carbon budget is not 1.5°C compatible. A November 2022 High Court judgment ruled that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C are merely "aspirational" and the Act does not impose a legally binding 1.5˚C obligation on the government (Daalder 2022). The Court also confirmed the CCC plays a critical role in driving New Zealand’s climate action, but that the advice provided by the CCC in setting up New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget was not legally binding (New Zealand Government 2022c).

However, according to the CCC it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the NZ-ETS is fit to help deliver the outcome of prioritising gross emissions reductions. Without policy change, it is expected that NZ-ETS emissions prices will drive large-scale afforestation, displacing agriculture, and will delay reductions in gross emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022). According to one report, in 2021 50,000 hectares of NZ farmland was purchased for potential replanting with fast-growing pine for offsets (Limited and Orme 2022; Wannan 2022b).

In April 2022, the New Zealand government adopted its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050, reconfirming the government’s plans to reach net zero by 2050 and achieve a 24-47% reduction in biogenic methane by 2050.

It has put forward efforts to decarbonise key sectors such as transport and industry and has released an aligned budget. There are plans for fleshing out future initiatives to drive emission reductions in the energy and industry sectors by focusing on the following mechanisms: improved energy efficiency, fostering renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and accelerating emission reductions from industry.

In Budget 2022, New Zealand included major funding (NZD $2.9bn) to address climate change, funded through the proceeds from the ETS via the Climate Emergency Response Fund (Deloitte 2022; New Zealand Government 2022b).

The Budget topped up investment in the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) by NZ $680m to accelerate industrial decarbonisation of process heat that makes up a third of New Zealand’s energy use. In transport, significant funding (NZD 1.3bn) is allocated to cycleways and public transport (NZ $350m), decarbonising buses and freight (NZ $60m) and supporting car share trials (NZ $20m)(New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022b).

A scrap-and-replace scheme, aimed at subsidising people into EVs is also committed ($569 million), which, despite facing strong political opposition, has now started to yield results as 2022 recorded second biggest EV sales (Stuff.co.nz 2023). Additionally, NZD 840m has been committed for international climate finance under the Paris Agreement, with half of this going to the Pacific and 50% to target adaptation.

New Zealand’s main instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ-ETS) (Ministry for the Environment 2019). It relies on a market-based approach that ensures certain sectors report on, and are charged for, their emissions. It covers the following sectors: industrial processes, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, waste, horticulture, primary industries and industries involved in synthetic greenhouse gases.

Since June 2015, the NZ-ETS has transitioned into a domestic-only scheme, however recent moves indicate that the Government will reopen the NZ-ETS to international units to meet its 2030 emissions target, but it certainly aims to limit their use (Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand 2019).

The CCC published its recommendations to support the government decision on its updated NDC (Climate Change Commission 2021). The government subsequently released its Emissions Reduction Plan, published after public consultation in May 2022. The ERP includes three shrinking emissions budgets over three five-year periods to 2035, to support meeting the 2050 targets. However, the CCC’s emissions budgets do not meet the current NDC, let alone put emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway.

Subsequently, the Government passed a set of slightly stronger ERP emissions budgets than those recommended by the CCC, in parallel to ETS reforms. The ETS reform introduces a cap to limit the emissions covered by the ETS, which will decline in accordance with New Zealand’s carbon budgets based on the targets (Ministry for the Environment 2020c).

The revised ETS introduced the ability to auction New Zealand units (NZUs) from 2021, where bidders can bid for units. The proceeds from auctions were to be recycled for further emissions reduction in Budget 2022 (Shaw 2021b). In December 2022, the government increased the auction reserve price, the minimum price at which the NZUs can be sold to participants, to NZ$33.06/MtCO2e from NZ$32.10/MtCO2e (Ministry for the Environment 2022d). To regulate the price of units, the government set up a “cost containment reserve” (CCR) where it releases more units for sale to balance the prices if the price reaches NZ$50 (Ministry for the Environment 2020b). CCR trigger price was increased to NZ$80.64/MtCO2e from NZ$70/MtCO2e, significantly lower than the CCC's recommendation of a two-tier price structure of NZ$171/MtCO2e and NZ$214/MtCO2e (Goliy 2022).

Other amendments to the ETS include phasing out industrial allocations, LULUCF sector amendments, and details on the inclusion of the agriculture sector by 2025 (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). See specific sector analysis below for details.

In 2022, the government announced new settings for industrial allocations, admitting that over NZD 60m had been over-allocated to the country’s biggest emitters. From 2024, there would be no more new free allocations, with the current allocations being gradually phased out (RNZ News 2022). However, after public consultation the new bill before Parliament with the announced changes weakens them by increasing eligibility for new entrants, and increases the subsidy for big emitters (Newsroom 2022).

In July 2022, the Climate Change Commission issued its first review of the ETS, advising the government to change the way the ETS is set up, i.e. incentivising forestry and tree planting as offsets rather than cutting actual emissions, with Chairman Rod Carr warning that the ETS was more likely to deliver new plantation forestry than cutting emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022; Cardwell 2022). In November 2022, the government issued a new consultation around market governance of the ETS (Ministry for the Environment 2022e).

The government has now begun a public consultation around a National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry. It has also announced an update to the ETS that encourages permanent forests, which will begin in January 2023 (New Zealand Government 2022h).

The government launched the New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd (NZGIF) in 2018 (Scale-Up New Zealand 2019). The purpose of the institution is to catalyse investment in low-emissions initiatives. Investments so far have been directed towards distributed energy ($10m debt facility), energy efficiency ($3.8m in equity), transport ($5.8m hybrid investment and $15m green credit facility) (NZGIF 2021).

In November 2022, the government issued its first Green Bonds to raise funds for climate change expenditure (New Zealand Government 2022f).

New Zealand's planning laws were a major impediment in preventing high-emitting projects, such as the newly constructed gas-fired power stations in Taranaki. A 2004 amendment to the Resource Management Act inserted clauses stating that a regional council "when making a rule to control the discharge into air of greenhouse gases...must not have regard to the effects of such a discharge on climate change."

The same laws applied to the nation's exclusive economic zone legislation. The government repealed this clause under the Zero Carbon Act, and this amendment was due to come into force at the end of 2021, allowing regional councils - who grant most of the consents for high-emitting projects - to first establish policy statements (Parliamentary Counsel Office 2020). The delay to this repeal was extended and came into force on 30 November 2022. The government is now drawing up a national environmental standard on climate change, and a national policy statement on greenhouse gas emissions from industrial process heat, which will be released for public consultation and finalised in the first half of 2023.

In August 2022, the government released New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan based on the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment, setting out broad objectives for the country to adapt to the climate impacts already being experienced across the country (Ministry for the Environment 2022b). The plan maps out a plan of action to address risks, and will provide new policies and legislation, and embed adaptation into policies and approaches across government.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** New Zealand was one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge during COP26 and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. The share of methane in New Zealand’s total emissions is significant, at around 43.5%, but absolute methane emissions have remained the same since 1990. Around 89% of New Zealand’s methane emissions come from the agriculture sector.
- **Coal exit:** During COP26 New Zealand joined a coalition of 190 countries that pledge to phase out coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants.
- **100% EVs:** New Zealand is one of the signatory of COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission. New Zealand government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 (with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-driven cars), and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021.
- **Forestry:** New Zealand signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26. As of 2021 New Zealand’s sink capacity is 22 MtCO2e/year.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** New Zealand is an Associate Member of this alliance, which was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. As an Associate Member of BOGA, New Zealand commits to implementing domestic subsidy reform on oil and gas, to end the subsidies, end public financing of oil and gas domestically and outside its border, along with developing short and long term measures to reduce the supply of oil and gas in the global market. The domestic production of oil and gas in New Zealand is insignificant but the government has already banned new oil and gas exploration permits. In the ERP, New Zealand has included a plan for a just transition from gas.

## Energy supply

In 2020, energy related emissions made up 40% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand has set a target that 50% of total energy consumption will come from renewable sources by 2035 and has an aspirational target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of New Zealand 2016; Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021b). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is currently developing an energy strategy for New Zealand which is expected to be released by the end of 2024. The first ERP set the policy direction for reducing emissions from energy.

New Zealand’s electricity generation is a mix of renewables, coal, oil and gas, where hydro power meets a high proportion of demand (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Fossil fuels accounted for just 16% of electricity generation in 2018 (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Thermal baseload electricity generation is moving to a mix of wind, geothermal, and gas peaking plants, while a number of baseload electricity generation plants are set to be decommissioned (Ministry for the Environment 2019).

The decommissioning of the Stratford Combined Gas Cycle Turbine (380 MW) is expected in 2023, Whirinaki Diesel Peaker (155 MW) in 2024, and Huntly Coal Power station (400 MW) in 2030/31 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). New Zealand is part of the Powering Past Coal alliance and committed to no further coal for unabated electricity generation by 2030 (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In its first ERP the New Zealand Government indicated a tentative timeline for the development of gas transition plan over 2023-24, aiming to outline a fossil gas transitional pathway and thereby reduce reliance on fossil gas, while still providing for some fossil gas use in 2035 (Ministry of Business 2022b).

In 2018, renewable sources made up 83.3% of electricity generation, a level that has been high in New Zealand for decades, due to its extensive historical hydro generation, along with more recent wind and geothermal plants (International Energy Agency 2019). Reliance on hydro power creates vulnerabilities in the electricity system as it is subject to rainfall.

New Zealand experienced a dry year in 2019, where wind power could not compensate for the decrease in hydro power, and gas and coal were ramped up to meet the shortfall (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2020). In 2020, Genesis Energy imported more than 1.8 million tonnes of sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia to burn at the Huntly coal-fired power station, a ‘record year’ more than any other year and in the midst of a government-declared climate emergency (Bond 2021). Import volumes remain high in 2022, and almost half a million tonnes was imported in June 2022. New Zealand also exported significant amounts of bituminous coal over the same period (Ministry of Business 2022a).

One option being explored by the government to deal with the issue is pumped hydro storage at Lake Onslow (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021a) which would provide fast response for power system flexibility, intermittency back up allowing for more solar and wind, and dry year storage. Accelerating uptake and diversifying renewable energy along with energy efficiency will be key to decarbonising the sector (Climate Analytics 2021). Final decisions on this project have not yet been made, and coal continues to provide backup.

The Climate Analytics 1.5C National Pathway Explorer found that a 1.5°C compatible pathway requires New Zealand to be near 100% renewable power by 2030 and to phase out coal in the current decade and natural gas by 2032 to 2035 at the latest (Climate Analytics 2021). Similarly, the CCC recommends a target of 95% to 98% renewable electricity by 2030 to replace the current target of 100% by 2035 (Climate Change Commission 2021). It also recommends that coal be phased out of power generation as soon as possible and that this occurs under the principles of a Just Transition (Climate Change Commission 2021).

The CCC has recommended that the government draw up a national energy strategy to establish a coordinated approach to support low emissions technologies, and considering emissions reductions and removals; system reliability and affordability; future energy developments; infrastructure; equitable industry transitions; regional and national economic development planning; supply chains; and workforce and skill needs (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.** The CCC recommends a target of 50% of energy consumption to be renewable energy by 2035 including power, process and building heat and transport (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In November 2018, the government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration (Government of New Zealand 2018). Onshore, the construction of the 100 MW natural gas fired power plant in Taranaki has now been completed and the plant began operations in May 2020 - to be used as backup for peak periods and provide baseload when wind or hydro generation is low (Keith 2020). Further, Beach Energy has provided plans for fully developing the Kupe gas field and provide 10-15% of New Zealand’s annual gas demand and 50% of its LNG demand to the EPA, with two development wells to commence construction in late 2022 through to 2023 (Offshore Energy 2022).

The government is supportive of developing a hydrogen economy (Persico 2019). Hydrogen can assist in decarbonisation in a number of ways, particularly with respect to the industry sector and heavy freight transport. However, it is important to distinguish between hydrogen produced from renewable energy and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuel hydrogen causes a substantial amount of emissions and is thus incompatible with a 1.5°C world.

The government released a hydrogen vision paper for consultation in 2019 to inform a national hydrogen strategy (New Zealand Government 2019b). The vision paper suggests that hydrogen produced from fossil fuels may help in a hydrogen transition, but the government finds that there is greater opportunity for green hydrogen for domestic use and export, in line with the net-zero goal (New Zealand Government 2019b).

A hydrogen roadmap is currently being developed to provide a blueprint for the development of a hydrogen industry in New Zealand and help inform foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2022). The government is collaborating with countries like Japan and Germany to support research and development of hydrogen technology and has joined new hydrogen initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial portfolio.


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (mainly iron, steel and aluminium production) are responsible for around 6% of New Zealand’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, but these were recently revised upwards due to the reallocation of emissions from the New Zealand GHG Inventory published in April 2022 (New Zealand Government 2022a).

The main GHGs directly emitted by industry are CO2 (two thirds of emissions), followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Following the ratification of the Kigali Amendment in October 2019, New Zealand will begin phasing down HFCs in 2020 and cut usage by 85% by 2036 (New Zealand Government 2019a; Parliamentary Counsel Office 2019).

In the ERP, improvement of industrial energy efficiency has been put forward as an important strategy to reduce emissions from industries. In its Action 11.1.2, it outlines the NZ$220 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to replace the largest, most-used fossil fuel boilers with low-emissions alternatives (New Zealand Government 2022a). It also has a plan to support industry to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and switch from fossil fuels to low-emissions alternatives.

The government has a target to reduce industrial emissions by at least 1% a year between 2017 and 2022, with a particular focus on process heat. Based on the latest historical industry data, industry emissions increased 1% from 2017 to 2018, and dropped 1% between 2018 and 2019 (Ministry for the Environment 2021b).

New Zealand prohibited new coal boilers in manufacturing and production by 31 December 2021 (Woods, Parker, and Shaw 2021). The government has also banned new low and medium temperature fossil fuel boilers, and the phase out of existing coal boilers by 2037, following CCC advice (New Zealand Government 2022j).

The Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) is a government – business collaborative effort to lower emissions in the industry sector as part of COVID 19 recovery (EECA 2021). Since November 2020, three rounds of projects have been announced covering 53 projects, including $69m for co-investment grants over three years, and a crowd-in total of $117 million of private funding for abatement projects.

Dairy and coal industries lobbied the government during COVID-19 to exempt the coal production industry from lockdown, and coal production for domestic use was allowed to continue as it was deemed necessary for food production (Frykberg 2020). The dairy industry, New Zealand’s largest exporter, uses a large portion of coal consumption to dry milk powder, accounting for 71% of industrial use, and 25% of total coal consumption in New Zealand, coming in second only to electricity generation (27%) in 2019 (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment. 2019). The country’s largest dairy company, Fonterra, one of the biggest coal users, has now committed to phasing out coal boilers by 2037, the same date recommended by the Climate Change Commission (Piddock 2021).


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). Transport emissions are the result of heavy reliance on fossil fuels, poor fuel economy of cars, road freight reliance, low density living, and transport planning based on car use (Ministry of Transport 2021).

Light vehicles are responsible for the highest share of transport emissions at 67%, and 23% is from heavy vehicles (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand has the fifth highest CO2 road transport emissions per capita out of the OECD countries (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand also has one of the oldest car fleets in the world.

In 2020 decreased transport emissions led to a fall in total emissions by 3.5% from 2019, which is projected to a slow decline from 2024 onwards assuming increasing EV uptake (Ministry for the Environment 2021c; Ministry of Transport 2021).

Current transport policies include road user charge exemptions for low emissions vehicles, increased investment in walking, cycling, public transport, and rail freight (Ministry of Transport 2021). In 2021, the government introduced exhaust emissions standards for new and used vehicles entering the fleet depending on fuel type and vehicle weight (NZTA 2021).

However, this was delayed and, after discussions with industry, on 1 November 2022 the Clean Vehicle Standard 2022 Regulations came into force, and later that month the government confirmed the clean car emissions standard would be applicable to imports from 1 December 2022, and more widely from 1 January 2023 (Ministry of Transport 2022).

The New Zealand Government has a goal for a carbon neutral fleet by 2025/26 for light vehicle (New Zealand Government 2021c; Beehive.govt.nz 2021), with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-fuelled vehicles. However, in January 2023, the government announced a continuance of the cut in excise duty on fossil fuel, which was introduced as temporary measure in 2022 to deal with inflation (RNZ News 2023).

The 2022 budget allocated NZD 569 million towards a vehicle scrap and replace scheme for low income households and a shift towards electric vehicles. However, the plan has been criticised as yielding low emissions impact for a high investment, based on the high price of EVs and inability for many low income households to make up the subsidy gap to purchase EVs. Another NZD 375 million has been extended for modal shift and infrastructure development for active travel (New Zealand Government 2022k).

The decarbonisation of the heavy vehicle fleet is supported by the following initiatives: NZD 41 million investment to support the decarbonisation of public transport through supporting Public Transport Authorities to deploy low and zero-emissions buses and NZD 20m funding to support innovations in the decarbonisation of freight through low emission freight technologies, fuels, services, infrastructure, innovations and business models (New Zealand Government 2022k).

There are funds allocated for the upkeep of the rail transport network (New Zealand Government 2021d). The Government’s ‘electric vehicle first’ policy received $42 million for the leasing of low emissions vehicles across the public sector (Shaw 2021a). However, much of the national rail transport network has been closed down.

In 2016, the previous government announced an Electric Vehicles Programme aimed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), 64,000 EVs registered in New Zealand by the end of 2021 (Government of New Zealand 2016). However, this was later dropped by the incoming Labour Government, and replaced by a target for all new government vehicles to be carbon netural after 2025 (Stuff 2019; New Zealand Government 2021b), with agencies required to buy offsets for petrol-driven vehicle emissions after that time.

In February 2022, the Clean Vehicles Act, 2022 came into force, bringing with it a range of changes for EVs and emissions charges (Ministry of Transport 2022). It extended the Clean Car Discount Scheme from 2021. New rebates to encourage the public to buy electric vehicles was introduced from April 2022, giving an NZD 7500 rebate for zero emission cars, NZD 5000 for hybrid cars (up to 56g CO2 per km) and less for cars emitting 56-146g CO2/km (Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency 2021). The scheme has been extended indefinitely. The policy also included a tax on larger combustion engine vehicles with high emissions.

By the end of 2022 registered electrified SUV sales were up by 3.8% compared to 2021 (Scoop News 2023). To reach decarbonisation of the road transportation sector globally, the last combustion engine vehicle must be sold before 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022d).


## Agriculture

The agriculture sector represents around half of the country’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand is in the process of developing a set of policies to reduce emissions from agriculture. The government has released a draft policy based on a report developed in consultation with the agriculture sector - He Waka Eke Noa - to reduce emissions from this sector. The government claims its modelling results show this policy would be instrumental in achieving the methane reduction target (New Zealand Government 2022i).

Under the proposed plan, by 2025, a farm-level emissions pricing system will be introduced. Farmers who exceed the threshold for herd stock and fertiliser use, will be required to pay a levy that the government will set every one to three years, on advice from the Climate Change Commission and farmers (New Zealand Government 2022j). However, farmers would pay only 5% of these fees set under ETS – a 95% discount.

A separate levy price will be set for long-lived gases and biogenic methane (New Zealand Government 2022j). This policy will also extend financial support to the farmers for the adoption of technology to curb the emissions from cattle. However, this plan has been criticised for not accounting for on-farm forestry and related offsets, and relying heavily on trust and industry partnerships (Craymer 2022).

Revenue from the levies would be recycled back into the agricultural sector with incentive payments to farmers and to support new technology. The proposal was opened for public consultation until 18 November 2022 and final policy announcements are expected.

According to the ERP a new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions will be established to drive a step change in mitigation technology innovation and uptake on farms, with a first tranche Agricultural budget allocation of NZ$ 380 million (New Zealand Government 2022k).

Policies and action projections indicate agriculture emissions will decline by 2 MtCO2e from 2021 to 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). The government suggests emissions will decline due to several reasons: a decline in agricultural land use, particularly dairy cow, beef, and sheep populations; the One Billion Trees program and changes to the ETS which support afforestation; changes to farm management practices and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

In Budget 2022, a number of initiatives targeted at economic opportunities in the forestry sector, including $145 million for carbon sink development using new afforestation techniques, $111 million for improving sequestration and $91 million for stimulating greater production of woody biomass (New Zealand Government 2022b).

New Zealand has traditionally relied on the sinks from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing (Climate Change Commission 2021). The LULUCF sector has historically represented a big carbon sink that offset, on average, 40% of gross GHG emissions between 1990–2017 (average -29 MtCO2e yearly). New Zealand’s reliance on LULUCF to meet its NDC target decreased from to 26% from 35% since last year. Emission reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain LULUCF sector.

New Zealand’s “Kyoto forests”—largely exotic pine plantations planted in the early 1990s—are due to be harvested in the next few years. The platform Global Forest Watch evaluated a loss in tree cover of 1,290kha from 2001 to 2020, equivalent to a 11% decrease in tree cover since 2000, whereas tree coverage gain over the same period was 710kha (Global Forest Watch 2021). However, recent reports state that more than 175,000 ha of whole farms have been sold for afforestation since 2017 with the country recently opening for offshore investors (12,000 ha sold in 2022) (Stuff.co.nz 2022a).

Scenarios modelled by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research require the LULUCF sector to increase the carbon sink to 50 MtCO2e by 2050 in the zero net emissions scenario (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research 2018).

New Zealand has faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology has been criticised by LCANZI which finds that masking real emissions defies the Zero Carbon Amendment Act, which it argues would require a standard land based accounting approach (LCANZI 2021).

New Zealand uses a “modified activity-based” accounting method for the NZ ETS and NDC. Rather than recording emissions and removals as they occur, this method averages out the removals and emissions from plantation forests by disregarding emissions that will be outweighed by removals as forests are harvested.

Using this method can be misleading. For example, the proposed emissions budget for New Zealand by the CCC uses the “modified activity-based” method and presents net emission figures for the past three decades as much higher than compared to figures when recording emissions and removals as they occur, although the overall historical net emissions do not change (LCANZI 2021).

This accounting method has implications for the NZ ETS, the NDC and emissions budgets’ compatibility with the global 1.5°C goal.

The NZ ETS reforms introduced average accounting, allowing some exemptions for adverse events such as fires, allowing forests to offset deforestation by planting elsewhere, and delaying some forestry changes (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). The ETS allows foresters the option of using averaging to receive carbon credits for sequestration until they reach average carbon storage over the plantation harvest cycle, which raises questions around the certainty of the accounting methodology introduced, especially when the levels of removals will be central to New Zealand’s strategy in reaching the net-zero target in 2050. The other option available is to receive more credits as the forest grows and pay credits back after the harvest.

The Government has a policy to plant one billion trees by 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). The Government has so far reported having planted close to 480 million Trees as of September 2022 since the programme started, with 88% comprised of exotic species (NZ Government 2022; Stuff.co.nz 2022b). However, the programme also identified the difficulties of providing the appropriate incentives to achieve a sustainable and substantial increase in afforestation activities. Funding applications have now been closed.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from latest government data, the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 published in April 2022 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Emissions for 2021 have been estimated by the CAT. The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied.


## NDC and other targets

Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

The target for 2020 (5% below 1990) is based in the gross emissions in 1990 (i.e., LULUCF emissions are not included in the base year). The comparison calculations using the CP1 surplus and Kyoto Protocol forestry activities data is from the latest net position report (Ministry for the Environment 2021a).

The target for 2030 (Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC) is a 50% emissions reduction below 2005 levels The same target is reiterated in New Zealand’s updated NDC (New Zealand Government 2021a). New Zealand uses a gross-net approach (Ministry for the Environment 2021d). A gross-net approach is when a Party does not include the LULUCF sector in its base year (gross) but accounts for net emissions and removals from LULUCF for the target year (net). Such an approach is a logical and categorical error.

In the year 2005, New Zealand had a LULUCF carbon sink of 25 MtCO2e. However, New Zealand has chosen to exclude the carbon sink to ensure a higher baseline to apply the 30% reduction from 2005 levels. New Zealand then includes the LULUCF carbon sink in the target year 2030, which allows for higher emissions elsewhere in the economy. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the Paris Agreement as it allows for net emissions to continue to increase.

For the 2030 pledge, the CAT has estimated levels of emissions excl. LULUCF resulting from the NDC by subtracting Kyoto Protocol forestry activity emissions in 2030 from the targeted level (2030 data from: (Ministry for the Environment 2021c)).

The 2050 Long-Term Target has been quantified using the latest government historical data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). The CAT estimates the target by subtracting LULUCF and including methane emissions.

The projected LULUCF emissions for 2050 are based on the latest government projections (Ministry for the Environment 2021c). The government LULUCF projections provide a range based on “lower removals” and “upper removals”. These projections appear to be very optimistic when compared to government policy in the sector. CH4 emissions for 2017 were also available in the government data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). We include emissions from methane and exclude LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

The policies and actions projections are based on the scenario presented on the Ministry for the Environment website in March 2022 and harmonised to historical emissions of 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f).

The projections include “existing policies including a carbon price of $35 per tonne of CO2e in the Emissions Trading Scheme”.

The government projections from the Fourth Biennial Report include the effects of key quantifiable policies and measures implemented prior to 2019. Specifically, it includes the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme; Efficient Products Programme, Insulation and heating grants programmes; Productive and Low Emissions Business Programme; Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol; National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; Indirect effects of combined forestry land-use policies on agricultural land use; Afforestation Grant Scheme; Permanent Forest Sink Initiative; Sustainable Land Management Hill Country Erosion Programme; Erosion Control Funding Programme; One Billion Trees Programme; Crown Forestry Joint Ventures; National Environmental Standard for Air Quality (landfill methane); Waste Disposal Levy; Indirect effects of combined agricultural (forestry and land use) policies on waste; and the Tokelau Renewable Energy Project. The policies and actions projections do not include the NZ ETS reforms of June 2020.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its net emissions reduction target to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030 including LULUCF. We estimate that the emissions level excluding LULUCF targeted by the NDC is 51 MtCO2e in 2030.

New Zealand is in the small group of countries still using a gross - net approach for its emissions projections, despite wide criticism in terms of the environmental integrity of the target (Rocha et al. 2015). New Zealand excludes LULUCF emissions in the base year (2005) but accounts for them in the target year (2030) (see Assumptions section). While the update strengthens the country’s 2030 target, the effect is nowhere near a 50% reduction, as the government has deployed misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions to 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050.

The methodology the Climate Change Commission used to calculate emissions required for a 1.5°C pathway for 2030 and 2050 in relation to the NDC update was challenged in a judicial review to the High Court in February 2022 (Wannan 2022a). However, the High Court rejected the claim, and in its November 2022 judgment, ruled that the Act does not impose any legally binding obligation on the government to set an emissions budget compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (Daalder 2022).

The New Zealand Government plans to meet its NDC target through a combination of domestic emissions reductions, use of market mechanisms to purchase international offsets, and removal of carbon dioxide by forest offsets (New Zealand Government 2021a). Legislation reforms have ruled out using emissions carryover under the Kyoto Protocol period to meet the NDC (New Zealand Government 2020b).

New Zealand’s current NDC target is around 19 MtCO2e away from its 1.5°C compatible fair share range of CAT and is rated “Insufficient”. When assuming the entire target will be achieved domestically (which is not the case), the rating is “Almost sufficient”. This implies that not only does New Zealand need to strengthen that target slightly but to achieve the entire target through domestic reductions, it also needs to support reductions to achieve its fair share.

The gap between New Zealand’s 1.5˚C compatible domestic target and fair share contribution is around 15 MtCO2e which is similar to the offshore abatement government plans to use to meet NDC target (Ministry for the Environment 2022a). The amount of carbon market credits New Zealand is considering would allow the country to close its fair share gap. However, for 1.5˚C compatibility, the government needs to achieve and exceed its current NDC target through domestic reductions alone, which is not the current plan.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC New Zealand increased its emissions reduction target to 50% below 2005 level including LULUCF emissions, from the previous target of 30%. The updated NDC target is stronger than the previous target by 20 percentage points. This moves the rating of the target against modelled pathways from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” and against fair share from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”.

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 31 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, or 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway.

While the target is expressed as a ‘point in time’ target, the announcement indicates New Zealand will manage its NDC as a multi-year emissions budget of 595 MtCO2e (AR5) for 2022-2035, which has also raised questions as it is unclear how it relates to the target (Ministry for the Environment 2022c).

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030

New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO2e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO2e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years.

New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e).

New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021).

In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting. Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here** **.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


## 2020 pledge

In brief, New Zealand has an unconditional target of reducing emissions 5% below 1990 by 2020, and a conditional target of 10 to 20% below 1990 emissions levels by 2020. The CAT calculates the unconditional target is calculated to be 62 MtCO2e in 2020 excluding LULUCF and the conditional target to be 52-59 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.

With emissions at 79 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2020, New Zealand did not meet its 2020 pledge (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). For more details on New Zealand's 2020 target, please see the 2020 pledge section here.


# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

New Zealand has submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once we have analysed the new NDC, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

New Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.


## Policy overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, but it will not achieve its NDC with currently implemented policies, and plans to make up the shortfall (around two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets.

The CAT finds that following an emissions trajectory based on policy and actions, New Zealand will have emissions of 74 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), 14% higher than 1990 levels. The NDC target equates to 51 MTCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% lower 1990 levels.

CAT policies and action projections for New Zealand are based on government sources which project a dip in emissions in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and a rebound in 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). This policies and action trajectory assumes New Zealand can sustain the low emissions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as the economy recovers.

In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035. The emissions budget until 2035 is around 835 MtCO2e (in GWP AR5), 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).

Non-government organisation Lawyers for Climate Change Action (LCANZI) has pointed out that the CCC’s carbon budget is not 1.5°C compatible. A November 2022 High Court judgment ruled that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C are merely "aspirational" and the Act does not impose a legally binding 1.5˚C obligation on the government (Daalder 2022). The Court also confirmed the CCC plays a critical role in driving New Zealand’s climate action, but that the advice provided by the CCC in setting up New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget was not legally binding (New Zealand Government 2022c).

However, according to the CCC it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the NZ-ETS is fit to help deliver the outcome of prioritising gross emissions reductions. Without policy change, it is expected that NZ-ETS emissions prices will drive large-scale afforestation, displacing agriculture, and will delay reductions in gross emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022). According to one report, in 2021 50,000 hectares of NZ farmland was purchased for potential replanting with fast-growing pine for offsets (Limited and Orme 2022; Wannan 2022b).

In April 2022, the New Zealand government adopted its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050, reconfirming the government’s plans to reach net zero by 2050 and achieve a 24-47% reduction in biogenic methane by 2050.

It has put forward efforts to decarbonise key sectors such as transport and industry and has released an aligned budget. There are plans for fleshing out future initiatives to drive emission reductions in the energy and industry sectors by focusing on the following mechanisms: improved energy efficiency, fostering renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and accelerating emission reductions from industry.

In Budget 2022, New Zealand included major funding (NZD $2.9bn) to address climate change, funded through the proceeds from the ETS via the Climate Emergency Response Fund (Deloitte 2022; New Zealand Government 2022b).

The Budget topped up investment in the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) by NZ $680m to accelerate industrial decarbonisation of process heat that makes up a third of New Zealand’s energy use. In transport, significant funding (NZD 1.3bn) is allocated to cycleways and public transport (NZ $350m), decarbonising buses and freight (NZ $60m) and supporting car share trials (NZ $20m)(New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022b).

A scrap-and-replace scheme, aimed at subsidising people into EVs is also committed ($569 million), which, despite facing strong political opposition, has now started to yield results as 2022 recorded second biggest EV sales (Stuff.co.nz 2023). Additionally, NZD 840m has been committed for international climate finance under the Paris Agreement, with half of this going to the Pacific and 50% to target adaptation.

New Zealand’s main instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ-ETS) (Ministry for the Environment 2019). It relies on a market-based approach that ensures certain sectors report on, and are charged for, their emissions. It covers the following sectors: industrial processes, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, waste, horticulture, primary industries and industries involved in synthetic greenhouse gases.

Since June 2015, the NZ-ETS has transitioned into a domestic-only scheme, however recent moves indicate that the Government will reopen the NZ-ETS to international units to meet its 2030 emissions target, but it certainly aims to limit their use (Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand 2019).

The CCC published its recommendations to support the government decision on its updated NDC (Climate Change Commission 2021). The government subsequently released its Emissions Reduction Plan, published after public consultation in May 2022. The ERP includes three shrinking emissions budgets over three five-year periods to 2035, to support meeting the 2050 targets. However, the CCC’s emissions budgets do not meet the current NDC, let alone put emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway.

Subsequently, the Government passed a set of slightly stronger ERP emissions budgets than those recommended by the CCC, in parallel to ETS reforms. The ETS reform introduces a cap to limit the emissions covered by the ETS, which will decline in accordance with New Zealand’s carbon budgets based on the targets (Ministry for the Environment 2020c).

The revised ETS introduced the ability to auction New Zealand units (NZUs) from 2021, where bidders can bid for units. The proceeds from auctions were to be recycled for further emissions reduction in Budget 2022 (Shaw 2021b). In December 2022, the government increased the auction reserve price, the minimum price at which the NZUs can be sold to participants, to NZ$33.06/MtCO2e from NZ$32.10/MtCO2e (Ministry for the Environment 2022d). To regulate the price of units, the government set up a “cost containment reserve” (CCR) where it releases more units for sale to balance the prices if the price reaches NZ$50 (Ministry for the Environment 2020b). CCR trigger price was increased to NZ$80.64/MtCO2e from NZ$70/MtCO2e, significantly lower than the CCC's recommendation of a two-tier price structure of NZ$171/MtCO2e and NZ$214/MtCO2e (Goliy 2022).

Other amendments to the ETS include phasing out industrial allocations, LULUCF sector amendments, and details on the inclusion of the agriculture sector by 2025 (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). See specific sector analysis below for details.

In 2022, the government announced new settings for industrial allocations, admitting that over NZD 60m had been over-allocated to the country’s biggest emitters. From 2024, there would be no more new free allocations, with the current allocations being gradually phased out (RNZ News 2022). However, after public consultation the new bill before Parliament with the announced changes weakens them by increasing eligibility for new entrants, and increases the subsidy for big emitters (Newsroom 2022).

In July 2022, the Climate Change Commission issued its first review of the ETS, advising the government to change the way the ETS is set up, i.e. incentivising forestry and tree planting as offsets rather than cutting actual emissions, with Chairman Rod Carr warning that the ETS was more likely to deliver new plantation forestry than cutting emissions (Climate Change Commission 2022; Cardwell 2022). In November 2022, the government issued a new consultation around market governance of the ETS (Ministry for the Environment 2022e).

The government has now begun a public consultation around a National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry. It has also announced an update to the ETS that encourages permanent forests, which will begin in January 2023 (New Zealand Government 2022h).

The government launched the New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd (NZGIF) in 2018 (Scale-Up New Zealand 2019). The purpose of the institution is to catalyse investment in low-emissions initiatives. Investments so far have been directed towards distributed energy ($10m debt facility), energy efficiency ($3.8m in equity), transport ($5.8m hybrid investment and $15m green credit facility) (NZGIF 2021).

In November 2022, the government issued its first Green Bonds to raise funds for climate change expenditure (New Zealand Government 2022f).

New Zealand's planning laws were a major impediment in preventing high-emitting projects, such as the newly constructed gas-fired power stations in Taranaki. A 2004 amendment to the Resource Management Act inserted clauses stating that a regional council "when making a rule to control the discharge into air of greenhouse gases...must not have regard to the effects of such a discharge on climate change."

The same laws applied to the nation's exclusive economic zone legislation. The government repealed this clause under the Zero Carbon Act, and this amendment was due to come into force at the end of 2021, allowing regional councils - who grant most of the consents for high-emitting projects - to first establish policy statements (Parliamentary Counsel Office 2020). The delay to this repeal was extended and came into force on 30 November 2022. The government is now drawing up a national environmental standard on climate change, and a national policy statement on greenhouse gas emissions from industrial process heat, which will be released for public consultation and finalised in the first half of 2023.

In August 2022, the government released New Zealand’s first National Adaptation Plan based on the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment, setting out broad objectives for the country to adapt to the climate impacts already being experienced across the country (Ministry for the Environment 2022b). The plan maps out a plan of action to address risks, and will provide new policies and legislation, and embed adaptation into policies and approaches across government.


## Sectoral pledges

In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.

For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.

NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.

- **Methane pledge:** New Zealand was one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge during COP26 and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. The share of methane in New Zealand’s total emissions is significant, at around 43.5%, but absolute methane emissions have remained the same since 1990. Around 89% of New Zealand’s methane emissions come from the agriculture sector.
- **Coal exit:** During COP26 New Zealand joined a coalition of 190 countries that pledge to phase out coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants.
- **100% EVs:** New Zealand is one of the signatory of COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission. New Zealand government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 (with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-driven cars), and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021.
- **Forestry:** New Zealand signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26. As of 2021 New Zealand’s sink capacity is 22 MtCO2e/year.
- **Beyond oil and gas:** New Zealand is an Associate Member of this alliance, which was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. As an Associate Member of BOGA, New Zealand commits to implementing domestic subsidy reform on oil and gas, to end the subsidies, end public financing of oil and gas domestically and outside its border, along with developing short and long term measures to reduce the supply of oil and gas in the global market. The domestic production of oil and gas in New Zealand is insignificant but the government has already banned new oil and gas exploration permits. In the ERP, New Zealand has included a plan for a just transition from gas.

## Energy supply

In 2020, energy related emissions made up 40% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand has set a target that 50% of total energy consumption will come from renewable sources by 2035 and has an aspirational target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of New Zealand 2016; Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021b). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is currently developing an energy strategy for New Zealand which is expected to be released by the end of 2024. The first ERP set the policy direction for reducing emissions from energy.

New Zealand’s electricity generation is a mix of renewables, coal, oil and gas, where hydro power meets a high proportion of demand (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Fossil fuels accounted for just 16% of electricity generation in 2018 (Ministry for the Environment 2020a). Thermal baseload electricity generation is moving to a mix of wind, geothermal, and gas peaking plants, while a number of baseload electricity generation plants are set to be decommissioned (Ministry for the Environment 2019).

The decommissioning of the Stratford Combined Gas Cycle Turbine (380 MW) is expected in 2023, Whirinaki Diesel Peaker (155 MW) in 2024, and Huntly Coal Power station (400 MW) in 2030/31 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). New Zealand is part of the Powering Past Coal alliance and committed to no further coal for unabated electricity generation by 2030 (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In its first ERP the New Zealand Government indicated a tentative timeline for the development of gas transition plan over 2023-24, aiming to outline a fossil gas transitional pathway and thereby reduce reliance on fossil gas, while still providing for some fossil gas use in 2035 (Ministry of Business 2022b).

In 2018, renewable sources made up 83.3% of electricity generation, a level that has been high in New Zealand for decades, due to its extensive historical hydro generation, along with more recent wind and geothermal plants (International Energy Agency 2019). Reliance on hydro power creates vulnerabilities in the electricity system as it is subject to rainfall.

New Zealand experienced a dry year in 2019, where wind power could not compensate for the decrease in hydro power, and gas and coal were ramped up to meet the shortfall (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2020). In 2020, Genesis Energy imported more than 1.8 million tonnes of sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia to burn at the Huntly coal-fired power station, a ‘record year’ more than any other year and in the midst of a government-declared climate emergency (Bond 2021). Import volumes remain high in 2022, and almost half a million tonnes was imported in June 2022. New Zealand also exported significant amounts of bituminous coal over the same period (Ministry of Business 2022a).

One option being explored by the government to deal with the issue is pumped hydro storage at Lake Onslow (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2021a) which would provide fast response for power system flexibility, intermittency back up allowing for more solar and wind, and dry year storage. Accelerating uptake and diversifying renewable energy along with energy efficiency will be key to decarbonising the sector (Climate Analytics 2021). Final decisions on this project have not yet been made, and coal continues to provide backup.

The Climate Analytics 1.5C National Pathway Explorer found that a 1.5°C compatible pathway requires New Zealand to be near 100% renewable power by 2030 and to phase out coal in the current decade and natural gas by 2032 to 2035 at the latest (Climate Analytics 2021). Similarly, the CCC recommends a target of 95% to 98% renewable electricity by 2030 to replace the current target of 100% by 2035 (Climate Change Commission 2021). It also recommends that coal be phased out of power generation as soon as possible and that this occurs under the principles of a Just Transition (Climate Change Commission 2021).

The CCC has recommended that the government draw up a national energy strategy to establish a coordinated approach to support low emissions technologies, and considering emissions reductions and removals; system reliability and affordability; future energy developments; infrastructure; equitable industry transitions; regional and national economic development planning; supply chains; and workforce and skill needs (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.** The CCC recommends a target of 50% of energy consumption to be renewable energy by 2035 including power, process and building heat and transport (Climate Change Commission 2021)**.**

In November 2018, the government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration (Government of New Zealand 2018). Onshore, the construction of the 100 MW natural gas fired power plant in Taranaki has now been completed and the plant began operations in May 2020 - to be used as backup for peak periods and provide baseload when wind or hydro generation is low (Keith 2020). Further, Beach Energy has provided plans for fully developing the Kupe gas field and provide 10-15% of New Zealand’s annual gas demand and 50% of its LNG demand to the EPA, with two development wells to commence construction in late 2022 through to 2023 (Offshore Energy 2022).

The government is supportive of developing a hydrogen economy (Persico 2019). Hydrogen can assist in decarbonisation in a number of ways, particularly with respect to the industry sector and heavy freight transport. However, it is important to distinguish between hydrogen produced from renewable energy and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuel hydrogen causes a substantial amount of emissions and is thus incompatible with a 1.5°C world.

The government released a hydrogen vision paper for consultation in 2019 to inform a national hydrogen strategy (New Zealand Government 2019b). The vision paper suggests that hydrogen produced from fossil fuels may help in a hydrogen transition, but the government finds that there is greater opportunity for green hydrogen for domestic use and export, in line with the net-zero goal (New Zealand Government 2019b).

A hydrogen roadmap is currently being developed to provide a blueprint for the development of a hydrogen industry in New Zealand and help inform foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment 2022). The government is collaborating with countries like Japan and Germany to support research and development of hydrogen technology and has joined new hydrogen initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial portfolio.


## Industry

Industrial processes and product use (mainly iron, steel and aluminium production) are responsible for around 6% of New Zealand’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, but these were recently revised upwards due to the reallocation of emissions from the New Zealand GHG Inventory published in April 2022 (New Zealand Government 2022a).

The main GHGs directly emitted by industry are CO2 (two thirds of emissions), followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Following the ratification of the Kigali Amendment in October 2019, New Zealand will begin phasing down HFCs in 2020 and cut usage by 85% by 2036 (New Zealand Government 2019a; Parliamentary Counsel Office 2019).

In the ERP, improvement of industrial energy efficiency has been put forward as an important strategy to reduce emissions from industries. In its Action 11.1.2, it outlines the NZ$220 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to replace the largest, most-used fossil fuel boilers with low-emissions alternatives (New Zealand Government 2022a). It also has a plan to support industry to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and switch from fossil fuels to low-emissions alternatives.

The government has a target to reduce industrial emissions by at least 1% a year between 2017 and 2022, with a particular focus on process heat. Based on the latest historical industry data, industry emissions increased 1% from 2017 to 2018, and dropped 1% between 2018 and 2019 (Ministry for the Environment 2021b).

New Zealand prohibited new coal boilers in manufacturing and production by 31 December 2021 (Woods, Parker, and Shaw 2021). The government has also banned new low and medium temperature fossil fuel boilers, and the phase out of existing coal boilers by 2037, following CCC advice (New Zealand Government 2022j).

The Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) is a government – business collaborative effort to lower emissions in the industry sector as part of COVID 19 recovery (EECA 2021). Since November 2020, three rounds of projects have been announced covering 53 projects, including $69m for co-investment grants over three years, and a crowd-in total of $117 million of private funding for abatement projects.

Dairy and coal industries lobbied the government during COVID-19 to exempt the coal production industry from lockdown, and coal production for domestic use was allowed to continue as it was deemed necessary for food production (Frykberg 2020). The dairy industry, New Zealand’s largest exporter, uses a large portion of coal consumption to dry milk powder, accounting for 71% of industrial use, and 25% of total coal consumption in New Zealand, coming in second only to electricity generation (27%) in 2019 (Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment. 2019). The country’s largest dairy company, Fonterra, one of the biggest coal users, has now committed to phasing out coal boilers by 2037, the same date recommended by the Climate Change Commission (Piddock 2021).


## Transport

Transport is the second largest source of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). Transport emissions are the result of heavy reliance on fossil fuels, poor fuel economy of cars, road freight reliance, low density living, and transport planning based on car use (Ministry of Transport 2021).

Light vehicles are responsible for the highest share of transport emissions at 67%, and 23% is from heavy vehicles (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand has the fifth highest CO2 road transport emissions per capita out of the OECD countries (Ministry of Transport 2021). New Zealand also has one of the oldest car fleets in the world.

In 2020 decreased transport emissions led to a fall in total emissions by 3.5% from 2019, which is projected to a slow decline from 2024 onwards assuming increasing EV uptake (Ministry for the Environment 2021c; Ministry of Transport 2021).

Current transport policies include road user charge exemptions for low emissions vehicles, increased investment in walking, cycling, public transport, and rail freight (Ministry of Transport 2021). In 2021, the government introduced exhaust emissions standards for new and used vehicles entering the fleet depending on fuel type and vehicle weight (NZTA 2021).

However, this was delayed and, after discussions with industry, on 1 November 2022 the Clean Vehicle Standard 2022 Regulations came into force, and later that month the government confirmed the clean car emissions standard would be applicable to imports from 1 December 2022, and more widely from 1 January 2023 (Ministry of Transport 2022).

The New Zealand Government has a goal for a carbon neutral fleet by 2025/26 for light vehicle (New Zealand Government 2021c; Beehive.govt.nz 2021), with agencies having to buy offsets for their remaining petrol-fuelled vehicles. However, in January 2023, the government announced a continuance of the cut in excise duty on fossil fuel, which was introduced as temporary measure in 2022 to deal with inflation (RNZ News 2023).

The 2022 budget allocated NZD 569 million towards a vehicle scrap and replace scheme for low income households and a shift towards electric vehicles. However, the plan has been criticised as yielding low emissions impact for a high investment, based on the high price of EVs and inability for many low income households to make up the subsidy gap to purchase EVs. Another NZD 375 million has been extended for modal shift and infrastructure development for active travel (New Zealand Government 2022k).

The decarbonisation of the heavy vehicle fleet is supported by the following initiatives: NZD 41 million investment to support the decarbonisation of public transport through supporting Public Transport Authorities to deploy low and zero-emissions buses and NZD 20m funding to support innovations in the decarbonisation of freight through low emission freight technologies, fuels, services, infrastructure, innovations and business models (New Zealand Government 2022k).

There are funds allocated for the upkeep of the rail transport network (New Zealand Government 2021d). The Government’s ‘electric vehicle first’ policy received $42 million for the leasing of low emissions vehicles across the public sector (Shaw 2021a). However, much of the national rail transport network has been closed down.

In 2016, the previous government announced an Electric Vehicles Programme aimed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), 64,000 EVs registered in New Zealand by the end of 2021 (Government of New Zealand 2016). However, this was later dropped by the incoming Labour Government, and replaced by a target for all new government vehicles to be carbon netural after 2025 (Stuff 2019; New Zealand Government 2021b), with agencies required to buy offsets for petrol-driven vehicle emissions after that time.

In February 2022, the Clean Vehicles Act, 2022 came into force, bringing with it a range of changes for EVs and emissions charges (Ministry of Transport 2022). It extended the Clean Car Discount Scheme from 2021. New rebates to encourage the public to buy electric vehicles was introduced from April 2022, giving an NZD 7500 rebate for zero emission cars, NZD 5000 for hybrid cars (up to 56g CO2 per km) and less for cars emitting 56-146g CO2/km (Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency 2021). The scheme has been extended indefinitely. The policy also included a tax on larger combustion engine vehicles with high emissions.

By the end of 2022 registered electrified SUV sales were up by 3.8% compared to 2021 (Scoop News 2023). To reach decarbonisation of the road transportation sector globally, the last combustion engine vehicle must be sold before 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022d).


## Agriculture

The agriculture sector represents around half of the country’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). New Zealand is in the process of developing a set of policies to reduce emissions from agriculture. The government has released a draft policy based on a report developed in consultation with the agriculture sector - He Waka Eke Noa - to reduce emissions from this sector. The government claims its modelling results show this policy would be instrumental in achieving the methane reduction target (New Zealand Government 2022i).

Under the proposed plan, by 2025, a farm-level emissions pricing system will be introduced. Farmers who exceed the threshold for herd stock and fertiliser use, will be required to pay a levy that the government will set every one to three years, on advice from the Climate Change Commission and farmers (New Zealand Government 2022j). However, farmers would pay only 5% of these fees set under ETS – a 95% discount.

A separate levy price will be set for long-lived gases and biogenic methane (New Zealand Government 2022j). This policy will also extend financial support to the farmers for the adoption of technology to curb the emissions from cattle. However, this plan has been criticised for not accounting for on-farm forestry and related offsets, and relying heavily on trust and industry partnerships (Craymer 2022).

Revenue from the levies would be recycled back into the agricultural sector with incentive payments to farmers and to support new technology. The proposal was opened for public consultation until 18 November 2022 and final policy announcements are expected.

According to the ERP a new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions will be established to drive a step change in mitigation technology innovation and uptake on farms, with a first tranche Agricultural budget allocation of NZ$ 380 million (New Zealand Government 2022k).

Policies and action projections indicate agriculture emissions will decline by 2 MtCO2e from 2021 to 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f). The government suggests emissions will decline due to several reasons: a decline in agricultural land use, particularly dairy cow, beef, and sheep populations; the One Billion Trees program and changes to the ETS which support afforestation; changes to farm management practices and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.

In Budget 2022, a number of initiatives targeted at economic opportunities in the forestry sector, including $145 million for carbon sink development using new afforestation techniques, $111 million for improving sequestration and $91 million for stimulating greater production of woody biomass (New Zealand Government 2022b).

New Zealand has traditionally relied on the sinks from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing (Climate Change Commission 2021). The LULUCF sector has historically represented a big carbon sink that offset, on average, 40% of gross GHG emissions between 1990–2017 (average -29 MtCO2e yearly). New Zealand’s reliance on LULUCF to meet its NDC target decreased from to 26% from 35% since last year. Emission reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain LULUCF sector.

New Zealand’s “Kyoto forests”—largely exotic pine plantations planted in the early 1990s—are due to be harvested in the next few years. The platform Global Forest Watch evaluated a loss in tree cover of 1,290kha from 2001 to 2020, equivalent to a 11% decrease in tree cover since 2000, whereas tree coverage gain over the same period was 710kha (Global Forest Watch 2021). However, recent reports state that more than 175,000 ha of whole farms have been sold for afforestation since 2017 with the country recently opening for offshore investors (12,000 ha sold in 2022) (Stuff.co.nz 2022a).

Scenarios modelled by the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research require the LULUCF sector to increase the carbon sink to 50 MtCO2e by 2050 in the zero net emissions scenario (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research 2018).

New Zealand has faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology has been criticised by LCANZI which finds that masking real emissions defies the Zero Carbon Amendment Act, which it argues would require a standard land based accounting approach (LCANZI 2021).

New Zealand uses a “modified activity-based” accounting method for the NZ ETS and NDC. Rather than recording emissions and removals as they occur, this method averages out the removals and emissions from plantation forests by disregarding emissions that will be outweighed by removals as forests are harvested.

Using this method can be misleading. For example, the proposed emissions budget for New Zealand by the CCC uses the “modified activity-based” method and presents net emission figures for the past three decades as much higher than compared to figures when recording emissions and removals as they occur, although the overall historical net emissions do not change (LCANZI 2021).

This accounting method has implications for the NZ ETS, the NDC and emissions budgets’ compatibility with the global 1.5°C goal.

The NZ ETS reforms introduced average accounting, allowing some exemptions for adverse events such as fires, allowing forests to offset deforestation by planting elsewhere, and delaying some forestry changes (Ministry for the Environment 2020c). The ETS allows foresters the option of using averaging to receive carbon credits for sequestration until they reach average carbon storage over the plantation harvest cycle, which raises questions around the certainty of the accounting methodology introduced, especially when the levels of removals will be central to New Zealand’s strategy in reaching the net-zero target in 2050. The other option available is to receive more credits as the forest grows and pay credits back after the harvest.

The Government has a policy to plant one billion trees by 2030 (Ministry for the Environment 2019). The Government has so far reported having planted close to 480 million Trees as of September 2022 since the programme started, with 88% comprised of exotic species (NZ Government 2022; Stuff.co.nz 2022b). However, the programme also identified the difficulties of providing the appropriate incentives to achieve a sustainable and substantial increase in afforestation activities. Funding applications have now been closed.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from latest government data, the New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 published in April 2022 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Emissions for 2021 have been estimated by the CAT. The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied.


## NDC and other targets

Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

The target for 2020 (5% below 1990) is based in the gross emissions in 1990 (i.e., LULUCF emissions are not included in the base year). The comparison calculations using the CP1 surplus and Kyoto Protocol forestry activities data is from the latest net position report (Ministry for the Environment 2021a).

The target for 2030 (Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC) is a 50% emissions reduction below 2005 levels The same target is reiterated in New Zealand’s updated NDC (New Zealand Government 2021a). New Zealand uses a gross-net approach (Ministry for the Environment 2021d). A gross-net approach is when a Party does not include the LULUCF sector in its base year (gross) but accounts for net emissions and removals from LULUCF for the target year (net). Such an approach is a logical and categorical error.

In the year 2005, New Zealand had a LULUCF carbon sink of 25 MtCO2e. However, New Zealand has chosen to exclude the carbon sink to ensure a higher baseline to apply the 30% reduction from 2005 levels. New Zealand then includes the LULUCF carbon sink in the target year 2030, which allows for higher emissions elsewhere in the economy. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the Paris Agreement as it allows for net emissions to continue to increase.

For the 2030 pledge, the CAT has estimated levels of emissions excl. LULUCF resulting from the NDC by subtracting Kyoto Protocol forestry activity emissions in 2030 from the targeted level (2030 data from: (Ministry for the Environment 2021c)).

The 2050 Long-Term Target has been quantified using the latest government historical data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). The CAT estimates the target by subtracting LULUCF and including methane emissions.

The projected LULUCF emissions for 2050 are based on the latest government projections (Ministry for the Environment 2021c). The government LULUCF projections provide a range based on “lower removals” and “upper removals”. These projections appear to be very optimistic when compared to government policy in the sector. CH4 emissions for 2017 were also available in the government data (Ministry for the Environment 2021b). We include emissions from methane and exclude LULUCF.


## Current policy projections

The policies and actions projections are based on the scenario presented on the Ministry for the Environment website in March 2022 and harmonised to historical emissions of 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2022f).

The projections include “existing policies including a carbon price of $35 per tonne of CO2e in the Emissions Trading Scheme”.

The government projections from the Fourth Biennial Report include the effects of key quantifiable policies and measures implemented prior to 2019. Specifically, it includes the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme; Efficient Products Programme, Insulation and heating grants programmes; Productive and Low Emissions Business Programme; Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol; National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management; Indirect effects of combined forestry land-use policies on agricultural land use; Afforestation Grant Scheme; Permanent Forest Sink Initiative; Sustainable Land Management Hill Country Erosion Programme; Erosion Control Funding Programme; One Billion Trees Programme; Crown Forestry Joint Ventures; National Environmental Standard for Air Quality (landfill methane); Waste Disposal Levy; Indirect effects of combined agricultural (forestry and land use) policies on waste; and the Tokelau Renewable Energy Project. The policies and actions projections do not include the NZ ETS reforms of June 2020.


## Global warming potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

New Zealand submitted its updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its net emissions reduction target to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030 including LULUCF. We estimate that the emissions level excluding LULUCF targeted by the NDC is 51 MtCO2e in 2030.

New Zealand is in the small group of countries still using a gross - net approach for its emissions projections, despite wide criticism in terms of the environmental integrity of the target (Rocha et al. 2015). New Zealand excludes LULUCF emissions in the base year (2005) but accounts for them in the target year (2030) (see Assumptions section). While the update strengthens the country’s 2030 target, the effect is nowhere near a 50% reduction, as the government has deployed misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions to 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050.

The methodology the Climate Change Commission used to calculate emissions required for a 1.5°C pathway for 2030 and 2050 in relation to the NDC update was challenged in a judicial review to the High Court in February 2022 (Wannan 2022a). However, the High Court rejected the claim, and in its November 2022 judgment, ruled that the Act does not impose any legally binding obligation on the government to set an emissions budget compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (Daalder 2022).

The New Zealand Government plans to meet its NDC target through a combination of domestic emissions reductions, use of market mechanisms to purchase international offsets, and removal of carbon dioxide by forest offsets (New Zealand Government 2021a). Legislation reforms have ruled out using emissions carryover under the Kyoto Protocol period to meet the NDC (New Zealand Government 2020b).

New Zealand’s current NDC target is around 19 MtCO2e away from its 1.5°C compatible fair share range of CAT and is rated “Insufficient”. When assuming the entire target will be achieved domestically (which is not the case), the rating is “Almost sufficient”. This implies that not only does New Zealand need to strengthen that target slightly but to achieve the entire target through domestic reductions, it also needs to support reductions to achieve its fair share.

The gap between New Zealand’s 1.5˚C compatible domestic target and fair share contribution is around 15 MtCO2e which is similar to the offshore abatement government plans to use to meet NDC target (Ministry for the Environment 2022a). The amount of carbon market credits New Zealand is considering would allow the country to close its fair share gap. However, for 1.5˚C compatibility, the government needs to achieve and exceed its current NDC target through domestic reductions alone, which is not the current plan.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC New Zealand increased its emissions reduction target to 50% below 2005 level including LULUCF emissions, from the previous target of 30%. The updated NDC target is stronger than the previous target by 20 percentage points. This moves the rating of the target against modelled pathways from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” and against fair share from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”.

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 31 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, or 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway.

While the target is expressed as a ‘point in time’ target, the announcement indicates New Zealand will manage its NDC as a multi-year emissions budget of 595 MtCO2e (AR5) for 2022-2035, which has also raised questions as it is unclear how it relates to the target (Ministry for the Environment 2022c).

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030

New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO2e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO2e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years.

New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e).

New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021).

In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting. Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here** **.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


## 2020 pledge

In brief, New Zealand has an unconditional target of reducing emissions 5% below 1990 by 2020, and a conditional target of 10 to 20% below 1990 emissions levels by 2020. The CAT calculates the unconditional target is calculated to be 62 MtCO2e in 2020 excluding LULUCF and the conditional target to be 52-59 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF.

With emissions at 79 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) in 2020, New Zealand did not meet its 2020 pledge (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). For more details on New Zealand's 2020 target, please see the 2020 pledge section here.


# Summary


## Overview

**NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022.**

**In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement.**

**Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact.**

**New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030.**

**To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”.**

**To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law.**

**The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO****2****e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO****2****e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country.**

**These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality.**

**Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies.**

**Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”.**

**The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target.**

The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate.

New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution.

Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.

In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO2 gases to 290 MtCO2e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022.

The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.

Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen.

**For more detail, see the policies and action section** **here****.**

New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF).

The new target equates to around 51 MtCO2e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO2e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”.

This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With the update in NDC in 2021, New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO2e/yr by 2030, and commit to additional financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries.

New Zealand’s climate finance needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020, with a recent round of announcements for NZD 840m for international climate finance (50% for PICs and 50% for adaptation). However, contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate finance as “Highly Insufficient”. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad.

Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

For the past 30 years, New Zealand’s climate action has primarily relied on offsets from forests planted in the 1990s rather than effective climate policy, and the carbon removal benefits of the forests are diminishing. New Zealand’s reliance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) to meet its NDC target has decreased from 35% to 26% since last year. However, New Zealand is planning to purchase a significant amount of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target. Emissions reductions from emissions-intensive sectors should be a focus, rather than reliance on the uncertain mitigation potential of the LULUCF sector.

New Zealand has also faced criticism over its LULUCF carbon accounting methodology. Plantation forests have a pattern of sinking carbon during tree growth and releasing carbon when harvested. Large tracts of pastoral land have recently been purchased for this purpose. New Zealand’s LULUCF accounting methodology uses a “modified activity-based” approach which has been found to mask real emissions. This method has implications for the emissions trading scheme, the NDC, and the emissions budgets proposed by the Climate Change Commission.

New Zealand passed its Zero Carbon amendment to the Climate Change Response Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050. Methane emissions from these two sectors represent over 40% of New Zealand’s current emissions. Implementation is key and the methane exemption weakens the target considerably.

There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be at 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. A true commitment to net zero would require a further methane reduction of 18-25 MtCO2e in 2050, corresponding to the residual methane emissions that would remain unmitigated by the 2050 target. These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050.

The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

The CAT evaluates the target as “Poor”. Full details of the assessment are here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**.

New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation.

The Act established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) an advisory body that reviews and, if “significant change has occurred”, proposes changes to the net zero target. Interim five-yearly emissions budgets are also mandated by the Act, which must be accompanied by supporting policies and strategies that draw on the Commission’s advice. The CCC advice to government in June 2021 recommended five year emissions budgets from 2022 to 2035 to chart New Zealand’s course to meet the 2050 targets (Climate Change Commission 2021). In May 2022, the Government published the first three emissions budgets to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035, which is 2.3% lower than the recommendation of the Commission.

Earlier in 2021, it was pointed out by the Lawyers for Climate Action (LCANZI) that CCC’s carbon budget was not 1.5°C compatible (LCANZI 2021), and the organisation took the government to court over it. The High Court judgment said that the Zero Carbon Act's references to limiting global warming to 1.5°C were merely "aspirational" and did not impose a legally binding obligation on the government (Daalder 2022).

In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies.

New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government plans to buy a significant amount of international offset credits to meet its net zero target (New Zealand Government 2020a).

The transparency of the target is also poor, with unclear assumptions of the role of carbon dioxide removal or the land sector, and no clarity on how the government has assessed the target to be a fair contribution.

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – New Zealand aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – New Zealand’s 2050 net-zero target excludes biogenic methane from agriculture and waste, which are to be separately reduced by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). These methane emissions in 2021 make up over 40% of New Zealand’s emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2022g). Cabinet minutes released in January 2022 show that the climate change minister had recommended moving to an all gas net zero target before COP26 in 2021, however the government did not take up his advice (Ministry for the Environment 2022a).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping. The Act obliges the Commission to provide advice on whether and how the target should be amended to include emissions from international shipping and aviation by, latest, 31 December 2024.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – New Zealand reserves the right to the use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (Government of New Zealand 2019b). It intends to purchase a sizeable proportion of international offsets to meet its 2030 emissions target (see the targets tab for more details). In its LTS, New Zealand has further highlighted the need for so-called offshore mitigation action to meet both its NDC targets and net zero target for unavoidable emissions (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). New Zealand will release subsequent emissions budgets starting from 2025. It remains unclear how offshore mitigation action will be used towards 2050 to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – New Zealand enshrined its net zero target into law in 2019 (Government of New Zealand 2019a) and submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – New Zealand does not have separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Act sets up a legally binding process to review the net zero target. An independent Climate Change Commission (CCC), established under the Act, will review and, if necessary, propose revisions to the target. The CCC will also monitor progress towards interim five-yearly emissions budgets. However, its recommendations are not binding on the government. Recently, the High Court confirmed the legality of the advice provided by the CCC in enhancing New Zealand’s NDC and first three emissions budget, and confirmed that the 1.5˚C goal enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act was merely “aspirational” (New Zealand Government 2022c).
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – New Zealand does not provide transparent assumptions on how the land sector and carbon dioxide removal will be used to meet its target in the Zero Carbon Act. There is a provision in the Act that says that the Climate Change Commission may recommend a limit on the use of removals towards the target in the future, but there is no such limit at present. In its LTS, New Zealand stated that removals will be used only for unavoidable emissions without providing specific information on what the government considers unavoidable (Ministry for the Environment 2021e).
- **Comprehensive planning** – New Zealand will set interim five-year long emissions budgets, with three such budgets being in place at any one time to give a clear path over the next 10–15 years (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2019). Before the start of each budget period, the government will need to lay out the supporting policies and strategies that will be used to meet the budget, drawing from the advice of the Climate Change Commission. The government published the first three emissions budgets in 2022 and plans to cut its emissions by around 35% by 2035 (New Zealand Government 2022k).In its LTS, the government has provided sector specific action areas and strategies for the key sectors both in short- and long-term, without mentioning the mitigation potential of those strategies. It also does not provide any modelled emissions pathway to 2050 informing its planning to achieving net zero.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – New Zealand has neither provided an explanation for why its net zero target is a fair contribution to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit nor how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and their fair contribution. In its LTS, New Zealand has referred to the fair and inclusive transition plan at the domestic level by partnering with Māori.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.
