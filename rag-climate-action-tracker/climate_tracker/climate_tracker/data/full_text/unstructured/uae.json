    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**\n",
    "**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.\n",
    "Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.\n",
    "The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.\n",
    "Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.\n",
    "In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.\n",
    "The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.\n",
    "The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.\n",
    "In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.\n",
    "The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.\n",
    "There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:\n",
    "- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,",
    "- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,",
    "- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,",
    "- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,",
    "- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.",
    "To improve its climate action, the UAE could:\n",
    "- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,",
    "- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,",
    "- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.",
    "\n## Description of CAT ratings\n",
    "The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.\n",
    "Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.\n",
    "The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.\n",
    "First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.\n",
    "Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.\n",
    "Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.\n",
    "The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.\n",
    "First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.\n",
    "Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.\n",
    "The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.\n",
    "The full policies and action analysis can be found here.\n",
    "The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:\n",
    "First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.\n",
    "Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.\n",
    "The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.\n",
    "In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.\n",
    "The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**\n",
    "In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.\n",
    "The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.\n",
    "Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.\n",
    "Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.\n",
    "Target covers emissions / sectors partially (under 95% coverage)\n",
    "The target excludes both international aviation and shipping\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).",
    "- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).",
    "- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such \"scope 3\" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
