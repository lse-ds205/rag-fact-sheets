## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

The UAE has not updated its 2030 NDC to match the new 2035 NDC, which implies going from a 7% reduction in 2030 to a 44% reduction in 2035, below 2019 levels.

The UAE is not on track to meet its 2030 target under our current policy projections, needing an emissions reduction of 22% to meet its 2030 target. To meet its 2035 target, the UAE would need to reduce its emissions a further 31% – a total of 53% from its projected 2030 emission levels under current policies. Without details as to how these cuts would be made, the 2035 target is hard to view as credible.

These credibility concerns are exacerbated when assessing the UAE NDC’s sectoral breakdown. This shows that most emissions reductions are expected to come from the buildings, industry and transport sectors, but the power sector will remain largely fossil fuel based, with an unrealistic reliance on CCS instead of renewables. There is no improvement on the renewables target.

The new NDC clarifies the overall contribution of negative emissions but does not clarify what proportion is technological based CDR versus what proportion is nature-based.

On 6 November 2024, the UAE submitted its 2035 NDC, setting an absolute target of reducing emissions to 103.5 MtCO2e, which represents a 47% reduction below 2019 levels. This target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from its assessment, resulting in a target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035.

The UAE's 2035 target itself is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway but new NDC did not increase the ambition of its 2030 emission reduction target, which is well above our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. The failure to substantially increase the ambition of the UAE’s 2030 targets raises serious concerns as to the credibility of its 2035 NDC given that a further 41%-point reduction (jumping from 7% to 48% below 2019 levels) would be needed in national emissions in only five years between 2030 and 2035. The serious lack of alignment between its 2030 and 2035 NDC means the country cannot claim to be on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap.

The UAE’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UAE’s 2035 target does represent a significant step forward in ambition compared to its 2030 target, leading to emissions dropping by 40% between 2030 and 2035.

The UAE’s 2035 target leads to 44% lower emissions in 2035 compared to 2019 across all sectors excluding LULUCF. However, the UAE has not increased its 2030 target, which represents only a 7% decrease in emissions below 2019. So, the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2035 are expected to happen in the five years between 2030 and 2035. The steep rate of emission reductions assumed between 2030 and 2035 make this 2035 target not credible if it is to be achieved domestically.

The target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035 is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway of 121.4 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. However, the 2030 target is well above that path. Hence the NDC trajectory is not compatible with global least cost 1.5 pathways.

The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste sectors. It outlines measures and plans to achieve emissions reductions in each sector against a 2019 baseline and is largely in line with what the UAE presented in its previous NDC as well as its LTS. However, the NDC does not present any new sectoral targets for 2035 beyond its emission reduction targets (e.g. no new renewable energy capacity targets).

Further information on the UAE’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

The UAE has communicated that it intends to provide and mobilise:

- USD 2 billion in grants and concessional loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries
- USD 1.2 billion for climate action alongside the Declaration on Climate, Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRR)
- USD 200 million to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust
- USD 100 million to the Loss & Damage Fund
- USD 30 billion to the Alterra fund for industrial decarbonization, climate technologies, sustainable living, and the energy transition
- USD 100 billion together with the US for its Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) which support renewable energy both at home and abroad
The UAE’s NDC showcases many of its contributions towards climate finance but does not present a clear overview of how much it plans to spend per year, how it will be distributed by sector/activities, and which regions will be targeted.


## Credibility

The UAE’s 2035 NDC target is supported by sectoral targets and measures that provide a degree of credibility to it. However, given that most emission reductions are expected to happen between 2030 and 2035, it raises the question whether the 9% annual change rate in emissions implied in the NDC target pathway is realistic.

The UAE will need to implement new policies to reach its 2035 target. Emissions under current policies are expected to be 48-57% or 102-148 MtCO2e above the NDC target in 2035. With the planned measures outlined in its LTS, it is possible that the UAE could come close to its 2035 NDC target, but open questions remain about the UAE’s measures to decarbonize its power and industry sectors, and the expected role of CCS.

The UAE is one of the world’s leading fossil fuel producers and exporters. While under its new NDC it plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels domestically, current plans by its state oil company (ADNOC) make it clear that the UAE plans to continue expanding its oil and gas activities.


## Transparency

The UAE’s NDC includes an absolute emissions target, which covers all gases and sectors of the economy. It also breaks down the target to the sectoral level to show the decarbonisation contribution expected of each sector. In its LTS, the UAE presents an emissions pathway which includes both its 2030 NDC target and its 2050 net zero target. However, a new version of this pathway was not included in the latest NDC to include the 2035 target.

The UAE includes an estimate of negative emissions in 2035, which includes both LULUCF and technological CDR such as direct air capture. Negative emissions are expected to reach 9.3 MtCO2e in 2035. In its previous NDC and its LTS, the UAE did clarify the contribution of each type of negative emissions. However, it does not clarify the contribution of each type to the total in its 2035 NDC target. Finally, the UAE reserves the use of carbon credits under article 6 of the Paris agreement, but does not commit to using credits, nor provides an estimate of how many it would use.

It is important to present separate targets for each of these elements, or at least to clearly identify their contribution to the NDC target. This helps to increase transparency and assess the credibility of the NDC target, as each of these negative emissions options come with their own set of advantages and limitations.

The lack of clarity on the contribution of each negative emissions technology makes it harder for the CAT to assess the UAE’s NDC target excluding LULUCF. To estimate the contribution of LULUCF to the UAE’s 2035 target, the CAT assumes agriculture emissions from 2021 (last reported year in the national GHG inventory) remain constant until 2035 (which is supported by the sectoral pathway presented int the UAE’s LTS which show all emissions reductions in the agriculture sector until 2035 will come from decarbonisation and reduction of its energy use) and then subtracts this value from the AFOLU estimate provided in the NDC. The estimated LULUCF emissions in 2035 using this method is -7.6 MtCO2e.

The UAE claims that the “target has been established in line with a 1.5 pathway in an effort to showcase the UAE’s best efforts” but does not explain how such a pathway was derived, which would require breaking the global goal of 1.5°C to the country level of the UAE.

UAE’s climate targets and policies

Guide to a good 2035 climate target


# Policies & action

**The** **CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.**

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies are set, in a best case scenario, to plateau close to 2022 levels, at around 214 MtCO2e, or continue to increase to about 259 MtCO2e. Under current policies, the UAE is set to miss its latest 2030 emissions reduction target. To meet its 2030 NDC target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions by a further 15–40%. However, if the UAE implements the planned policies outlined in both its NDC and LTS, it could potentially reach its target. For more information, please see the Assumptions tab.

Since 2023, the UAE has published information on many relevant climate policies across all sectors of the economy. Both its NDC from 2023 and its LTS from early 2024 provide details on policies and action, both current and planned, in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

This is a significant step in transparency, which allows for a better understanding of how the UAE plans to reduce its emissions to meet its NDC and net zero targets. However, it also shows a critical overreliance on carbon capture and storage both in the power and industry sectors, a smokescreen allowing the country to continue expanding its oil and fossil gas production and use while claiming to be on the way to net zero.

In recent years, the UAE has announced plans to invest in renewables both at home and abroad, including a USD 100bn commitment together with the United States (Associated Press, 2023). However, in parallel it continues to invest into fossil fuel production. The UAE is planning to significantly increase its oil production in the next years, and is pushing to reach “gas self-sufficiency”, with major investments in offshore gas production. In November 2022, ADNOC announced a USD 150bn investment plan to expand its oil and gas business in the next five years (The Guardian, 2023). As part of this plan, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17bn in October 2023 for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). For more details, see the Power sector section below.

The developments and the investment going towards new fossil fuel infrastructure are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, instead are likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition towards renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and switch to renewables, which would reduce prices and price volatility for consumers, and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).


## Power sector

The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce electricity emissions by 11% below 2019 levels by 2030. Under this sectoral target, emissions from electricity are expected to be ~68 MtCO2e in 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its LTS, the UAE includes additional information on its power sector plan, including a demand forecast of 211 TWh by 2030 and a grid coefficient of 0.27 tCO2e/MWh, a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline level of 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.

According to the UAE’s latest version of its Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS, the 2030 target will be mostly achieved by expanding renewables and nuclear. However, the achievement of the 2050 target of a zero-emissions grid coefficient is expected to rely heavily on the use of CCS on gas power plants, instead of a plan to phase out fossil fuels from power generation.

CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels and increases emissions, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants.

The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54 billion over the next seven years to support its updated energy targets. However, it remains unclear if the recently announced investment plan is additional to the USD 160 billion the country had previously announced to support its 2050 energy targets (Associated Press, 2023).

In May 2020, the construction of the first phase of the UAE and the Middle-East’s first coal power plant was completed. This consisted of the first two units of the 2.4 GW ultra-supercritical Hassyan power plant, with the second phase planned for Q3 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

In February 2022, the UAE announced that it would be switching its coal power plant to fossil gas, in support of its net zero target, and has reported that the plant, originally designed as a dual-fuel plant, has now done so (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

The UAE’s revised Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS all confirm that the country is not planning to include any coal power in its electricity mix.

The UAE continues to develop nuclear power. In October 2022, the third unit of the Barakah nuclear power plant went online, increasing total capacity to 4.2 GW. The last unit of the project, awarded to a South Korean consortium, came online in February 2023. Once the last unit is operational in 2025, the plant will increase its installed capacity to 5.6 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

According to a Reuters report from April 2024, the UAE is planning to tender a new nuclear power plant between this and next year, potentially including four reactors similarly to the existing Barakah power plant (Power Technology, 2024).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.

As part of its energy strategy, the UAE is planning to expand its renewables capacity, mostly through solar power. The UAE plans to reach 19.8 GW of renewables installed capacity in 2030, with an expected 33 TWh of generation, up from 6GW installed capacity in 2023 (IRENA, 2023).

It also set out a target to produce at least 30% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. This falls significantly short of the CAT 1.5°C compatible benchmark for the UAE, which sets renewable power generation at 66% of the total by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b; Government of the UAE, 2023b).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation

As part of its LTS, the UAE plans to roll out additional policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. These include CO2 emissions targets or caps for power producers through regulators at the emirate level, incentives for distributed power generation such as net metering, installing PV solar in public buildings, and tariff revisions to facilitate load balancing (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE also continues to invest in large scale solar power and storage. With its current and planned renewable energy developments, the UAE is expected to reach 9 GW of renewable power by 2030. Following the construction of the ~1.2 GW Noor Abu Dhabi solar PV plant in 2019, the UAE has continued to develop utility scale PV plants. The Al Dhafra Solar PV plant, added another 2 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Tollast, 2022). In May 2022, a third solar PV project entered the tendering process. Once completed, the Al Ajban Solar PV will add 1.5 GW of capacity (Technical Review Middle East, 2022).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE has also committed to invest around USD 160bn over the next three decades in “clean” and renewable energy, which might include nuclear and fossil gas. As part of this plan, the UAE has signed a preliminary agreement with Engie Solutions (subsidiary of Engie) to develop further clean energy projects (Benny, 2022).

In November 2022, the UAE signed the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) with the US, committing to mobilise USD 100bn to support the development of 100 GW of renewables both domestically and abroad by 2035. However, it is not yet clear which technologies will be supported under the “clean energy” concept, and how this new commitment will interact with existing finance plans in the UAE, that means, whether the planned investments will be additional to previous ones. In July 2023, the UAE announced it will be investing USD 54 billion to achieve its new 2030 clean energy target. Same as for the PACE announcement, it remains unclear whether this commitment is additional to existing ones (Associated Press, 2023).

In addition to these solar power projects, a contract for the UAE’s first pumped storage hydroelectric plant, with an expected capacity of 250 MW, was awarded in August 2019, and scheduled for commission in 2024 (Power Technology, 2022). Abu Dhabi’s virtual battery plant, currently with 108 MW of capacity, will also be expanded with an additional 300 MW in 2026.


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for ~19% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce transport emissions by 1% below 2019 levels by 2030. Emissions from the transport sector are expected to be ~42 MtCO2e in 2030 under this target, and to reach zero emissions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

The UAE has set out some policies to manage transport emissions, including an increase in the fuel and emissions efficiency of its vehicle fleet, as well incentives for the use of public transport, and the uptake of EVs. The revised Energy Strategy 2050 includes new targets for the uptake of EVs, including reaching 691,100 EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and over three million by 2050 as well as increasing the number of EV chargers to 879 by 2030 and 30k by 2050. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have also set out a series of urban transport policies, aimed among others at incentivising the uptake of public transport and EVs (Government of the UAE, 2021). For example, in May 2022 the Abu Dhabi government set out a new EV charging station policy, defining standards and requirements in anticipation of growing demand for EVs. In Dubai, the Green Mobility Strategy 2030 includes a target to reach 30% EVs and hybrids in the government vehicle fleet by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

In its LTS, the UAE lists additional policies it proposes to reach its target for the transport sector towards 2050. The key pillars of the UAE’s transport decarbonisation plan are to reduce transportation needs, decarbonise passenger transport, freight transport, and mechanical vehicles (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The first pillar will include the development of mixed-use buildings, improved infrastructure for cycling and walking, incentives for carpooling and increased use of public transport and rail. In total this will contribute 14% of the reductions needed to achieve the UAE’s target. The second pillar includes incentives for the uptake of EVs, the electrification of buses, taxis and motorcycles. In total this will contribute 22% of the emission reductions needed.

The decarbonisation of freight transport includes a shift towards more rail use as well as the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. These measures are expected to contribute 27% of the reductions needed. Finally, the electrification of mechanical vehicles is expected to contribute 28% of the reductions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

Additionally, the UAE has set out plans to decarbonise its domestic maritime and aviation sectors, including electrification and use of sustainable fuels.


## Industry

The industry sector, including oil and gas production, is the largest source of emissions in the UAE, accounting for 46% of the country’s total emissions, or 103 MtCO2e. This includes emissions from industrial processes as well as indirect emissions from power and heat generation (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The UAE’s LTS includes a target to reduce industry emissions by 5% below 2019 levels by 2030, and 93% by 2050, while its current policy projections estimate these emissions will rise by 18% above 2019 levels by 2030.

The UAE has a series of policies to reduce emissions from its industry sector, mostly focusing on increasing efficiency through adoption of best practices. To reach its target, the UAE plans to adopt a series of policies such as a cap and trade system, contracts for difference, regulated transport and storage for CCS, updated blended cement regulations, updated building codes, hydrogen production incentives and others (Government of the UAE, 2024b). On April 2024, the UAE also ratified the Kigali amendment, committing to reducing HFCs consumption by 87% by 2047 compared to its average consumption in 2024-2026 (IIR, 2024).

The UAE plans to reduce its industry emissions through different means. Around 20% of the reductions towards its net zero target will come from fuel substitution and process switches in key industries such as steel and cement (Government of the UAE, 2024b). For example, the UAE’s LTS mentions the switch to concentrated solar power for heat for industrial processes and switching from blast furnaces to hydrogen-powered direct reduced iron processes for steel.

However, a large share of the emissions reductions (32%) is expected to come directly from the deployment of CCS and from the decarbonisation of the power sector which will also heavily rely on CCS. Such overreliance on a technology that has not yet been proven at scale can seriously hinder the UAE’s progress towards transitioning its industry sector and can serve as a smokescreen to continue expanding fossil fuel production (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE is the world’s seventh largest oil producer and 14th largest gas producer (US EIA, 2023a). It is also one of the world’s largest oil exporters. The UAE’s exported emissions from oil and gas are about 2.5 times larger than its domestic emissions (see graph below) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023c).

In 2022, oil production reached 4.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (US EIA, 2023b). Following an OPEC+ decision in October 2022 (Deepthi Nair, 2022), to cut production by twomillion barrels per day (mbpd) in an effort to keep oil prices up the UAE announced it would cut over 140,000 barrels per day from May 2023 until the end of the year (Gulf Today, 2023). However, the government also recently announced it was bringing forward its oil production capacity of five mbpd target (up from 3.8 mbpd currently), from 2030 to 2025, signalling its intent to ramp up production in the short term (Di Paola, 2022).

The UAE is also developing oil and gas offshore exploration and production. This is part of its efforts to reach “gas self-sufficiency” (ICLG, 2022). In February 2022, the first offshore fields were discovered, which are estimated to contain between 43 and 57 billion cubic metres of gas (AFP, 2022).

During 2022, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Drilling was awarded almost USD 6bn in contracts to “maximise value from Abu Dhabi’s offshore oil and gas resources” (World-Energy, 2022). In October 2023, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17 bn for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). This is part of a USD 150bn ADNOC plan to increase production of oil and gas.

According to the IEA, the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure beyond what was already committed in 2021 is incompatible with reaching net zero by 2050 (IEA, 2021). The UAE’s plans to further develop and invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These plans are also likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition to renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).

In October 2023, ADNOC announced plans to double its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation plan (Energy Voice, 2023). In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

During COP26, the UAE unveiled its “Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap”, a strategy aimed at developing the domestic production of green and blue hydrogen aimed at export markets in Asia and Europe. The roadmap already includes seven projects which are either completed or underway (including blue ammonia production). The overarching target of the strategy is to reach a 25% market share in key markets such as India, Japan, Germany and others (H2 World News, 2021).

According to the UAE’s 2023 NDC update, several projects are already under way to support the country’s hydrogen ambitions, and a new Hydrogen Strategy is being prepared (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its updated Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE also includes a target to produce 1.4 Mt of hydrogen annually by 2031. The UAE’s LTS includes additional information on its hydrogen development plans, including production targets of 7.3 Mt by 2040 and 14.9 Mt by 2050. Around half of the hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels with CCS (blue hydrogen), with the majority of the second half being green hydrogen and a small share coming from nuclear power (pink hydrogen) (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Buildings

The buildings sector accounted for ~28% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce building emissions by 56% below 2019 levels by 2030, while its LTS targets a 98% reduction below 2019 levels by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). Emissions from the building sector are expected to be 27 MtCO2e in 2030 under the NDC from 2023, while under current policies they are expected to be 35 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE set out a target of reducing energy consumption by 40%. Several policies are in place to support this target in the buildings sector, including the National Water and Energy Demand Side Management Programme and a federal government building retrofit programme, aiming at 2000 retrofits by 2050. Some Emirates have also produced their own plans and policies to reduce energy consumption from the buildings sector, including Dubai’s plan to retrofit 30,000 buildings by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

The majority of the emissions reductions in the building sector towards the UAE’s NDC target are expected to come from energy efficiency measures including more efficient heating and cooling, as well as demand side management initiatives. The emissions reductions necessary to reach the LTS target of 1 MtCO2e in 2050 will come almost entirely from reducing power and heat emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Waste

According to the UAE’s latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the waste sector accounted for 6% of the country’s emissions in 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE’s LTS sets a target for waste emissions, which are set to increase by 8% above 2019 levels by 2030 and should decrease by 75% below 2019 levels in 2050. Emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach 14 MtCO2e in 2030, up from 13 MtCO2e in 2019 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). This includes emissions from landfills as well as emissions stemming from energy used to transport and treat waste.

In January 2021, the UAE launched its Circular Economy Policy 2031, establishing a Circular Economy Council, tasked with supervising the implementation of waste reduction policies that also target the manufacturing sector. In May 2022, the Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant was launched, with a capacity of 30 MW. A further 200 MW plant is planned in Dubai and a 70 MW plant in Abu Dhabi, both expected to be operational in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Sharma, 2022).

However, the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy has no concrete waste or emissions reduction targets. We were not able to check whether its previous target of diverting 75% of its waste from landfills by 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2019) has been achieved. The UAE’s LTS includes a target of diverting 80% of its waste by 2031 and 90% by 2035. It also plans to capture the remaining methane produced in its landfills and retrofitting its waste-to-energy plants with CCS.

Under its net zero scenario, the UAE expects waste to contribute around 3 MtCO2e by 2050.


## Methane

The UAE signed the methane pledge at COP26, in which signatories agreed to cut methane emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. According to the UAE’s latest inventory, methane represented ~7% of total GHG emissions in 2021, mostly stemming from upstream fossil fuel production and waste (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE already includes methane in its NDC and has some policies in place designed to reduce both energy and waste-related methane emissions.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2021 are taken from the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). For the years between 1994 and 2021 emissions are estimated by interpolating values between reported values. For the period 1990-1994 and 2021-2022 we estimate values by using growth rates from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024).

The UAE now includes an F-gases estimate in its latest national inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly related to data availability. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

The historical data used in our previous assessment estimated emissions to be around 15% higher in 2022 compared to our current assessment. The data from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024) was based on the UAE’s latest inventory published in 2016, and used different methods to fill the gaps in the inventory and extend the estimates until 2022. The new GHG inventory published by the UAE in 2024 presents a significant upgrade in terms of data quality. The difference in economy-wide emissions estimates is mostly explained by a decrease in industrial process emissions, which are roughly half in the UAE’s own inventory compared to PRIMAP in 2022, and to differences in fugitive emissions data for 2021. According to PRIMAP’s estimates, the emissions they calculated for the UAE in 2022 based on their old inventory are 98% higher than the ones calculated based on the UAE’s new inventory for 2022. The UAE’s old inventory published in 2015 (Ministry of Energy, 2015) includes estimates for 1994 and 2014, while the new inventory published in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2024a) includes an estimate only for 2021.


## NDC

The absolute emissions level for the NDC target incl. LULUCF is taken directly from the NDC document.

**F-gases**

Because F-gases are excluded from the UAE’s 2030 NDC target, the CAT adds them into the quantification of the NDC by assuming that F-gases remain constant from the last historical year (2021) until the target year (2030). The F-gases estimate comes from the UAE’s latest inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly due to data limitations. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

**LULUCF**

The target in the UAE’s 2023 NDC includes LULUCF emissions. To estimate the emissions level resulting from the target excluding LULUCF, we take the value for its 2030 LULUCF target (included in the NDC) and subtract it from the main NDC target.

**Global Warming Potential (GWP) values**

The UAE’s 2023 NDC specifies that it currently uses AR4 both for the BAU scenario and the NDC and sectoral targets. For the 2020 NDC, which was presented in SAR, we converted the 2030 BAU value from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor from the last available nationally reported historical data point (2021).


## Current policy projections

**Lower bound**

The UAE’s LTS includes current policy projections which are used as a baseline for the net zero scenario (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The current policy projections include all mitigation measures in force up to 2024 in all sectors of the economy, while the net zero scenario includes planned measures and their estimated contribution towards the target. The CAT uses the UAE’s LTS current policy scenario for the lower bound of its own current policy projections.

The CAT harmonizes the UAE’s LTS current policy scenarios to the latest available historical GHG emissions data (from 2022) using the growth rates of the original scenario for the period 2022-2035. The UAE only provided data for its current policies for the years 2019, 2030, 2040 and 2050. To create a pathway, the CAT linearly interpolates the values between these years.

Because the original projections include emissions and sinks from LULUCF, the CAT assumes that LULUCF emissions remain at 2019 levels (latest historical data available) under current policies. The UAE’s 2019 LULUCF emissions are -1 MtCO2e.

**Upper bound**

For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy.

The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures. For this projection, we estimate total power generation by technology using capacity factors estimated based on the IRENA REMAP BAU scenario (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015).

In summary, the CPP upper end of the range for the UAE’s energy-related CO2 emissions is based on assumptions both about which targets will be implemented, as well as the role of fossil gas in the development of the power system.

For CO2 process emissions (from industry), we continue a linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030 (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015). For non-CO2 emissions, we apply the growth rate from the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 to PRIMAP historical data (US EPA, 2019).

We use the following data sources in our estimates:

- Energy-related CO2 from fuel combustion: “Renewable Energy Prospects – United Arab Emirates” (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015)
- CO2 process emissions (from industry): Own assumption to continue linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030.
- Non-CO2 emissions: Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 (US EPA, 2019)
- Historical installed capacity data: IRENA capacity and generation statistics 2023 (IRENASTAT, 2023)
- Historical electricity generation data: IEA World Energy Balances 2022 (IEA, 2022)
- Historical emissions factors: IEA Emissions Factors 2021 (IEA, 2021a).

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UAE’s net zero strategy covers all GHG emissions except F-gases and assumes a 3.5 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target and so that is the value taken for their net zero target excluding LULUCF.

Due to the uncertainty in estimating F-gases emissions in the UAE by 2050, the CAT does not include any estimation when calculating the UAE’s 2050 emissions excluding LULUCF. This can change in future updates once new emissions data for historical years and future projections are available.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

The UAE submitted an updated NDC for 2030 in July 2023 after having already strengthened its NDC target in 2022. With the UAE’s emissions still set to increase by 2030, we estimate it will not be able to meet this updated NDC target, nor the former one.

The NDC from 2023 has an unconditional and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 182 MtCO2e (including emissions from land use and forestry, or LULUCF) by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). The CAT rates this target, excluding LULUCF, as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

In October 2021 the UAE announced its intention to reach net zero emissions as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s net zero target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero.


## NDC updates

The UAE submitted a 2035 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 06 November 2024. The CAT’s analysis of the UAE’s 2035 NDC target can be found here.

The UAE submitted a stronger 2030 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 11 July 2023. While the UAE needs to put forward substantially improved climate policies to reach the NDC, it is an improvement on the former NDC in the following ways:

- It includes strengthened emissions reduction target—to limit emissions to 182 MtCO2e by 2030 (including LULUCF), down from 208 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a).
- The target is now expressed as an absolute emissions limit. The previous target was a reduction below a business as usual (BAU) scenario.
- The NDC provides sectoral targets for the electricity and water generation, industry, transport, buildings, waste and agriculture sub-sectors.
- It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency.
We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The CAT’s calculation of the UAE’s 2030 NDC target also includes PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and HFCs which are not covered by the target. For this calculation, the CAT assumes that F-gases remain constant from the last available historical data point (2021). In its latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the UAE reported its latest GHG inventory covering the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2021. The F-gases value for 2021 is 0.15 MtCO2e in AR4 (Government of the UAE, 2024a).

This new target represents a targeted decrease in emissions of 14% below 2022 levels (excl. LULUCF).

The NDC mentions many of the policies and strategies that underpin the 2030 target. This includes the UAE’s National Energy Strategy 2050, which aims for 44% of renewable and 6% of nuclear energy in installed electric capacity by 2050, while reducing final electricity demand by 42–45% (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

This strategy was recently updated to remove its previous target of 12% of coal capacity by 2050, which is now replaced by an increased fossil gas capacity from 38% to 50%. This updated strategy continues to be inconsistent with the need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050, due to the continued long-term reliance on fossil gas (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

The UAE reserves the option to use carbon credits for emission reductions abroad under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own domestic emissions to achieve its NDC target (Government of the UAE, 2023a). Although it has not yet announced any firm details of how it will secure carbon credits towards its climate targets (either the NDC or net zero), a privately owned Emirati company called Blue Carbon has recently made headlines for its carbon credit deals. Since its inception in 2022, the company has signed MOU's with the governments of Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to acquire conservation rights for around 60 million acres of their forests, to generate carbon credits from projects avoiding deforestation, and sell them on the market (Pearce, 2023).

Details on how the government of the UAE intends to purchase credits from Blue Carbon or other similar providers to support claims to offset its own emissions are unclear. This ambiguity presents major risks that the UAE will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. The use of credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should complement and not serve to distract from or displace critically needed mitigation efforts domestically.

The UAE’s 2030 NDC submitted in 2023 shows an increase in ambition and has improved its transparency by sharing sectoral targets and more details on the measures planned to achieve them. However, the UAE’s current plans for its oil and gas industry and its power sector continue to be incompatible with its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

- 29.12.2020 The UAE submits an updated NDC with first economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and "Insufficient" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways.

CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update.

For more details, please see the Assumptions section.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023).

We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.


# Summary


## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

The UAE has not updated its 2030 NDC to match the new 2035 NDC, which implies going from a 7% reduction in 2030 to a 44% reduction in 2035, below 2019 levels.

The UAE is not on track to meet its 2030 target under our current policy projections, needing an emissions reduction of 22% to meet its 2030 target. To meet its 2035 target, the UAE would need to reduce its emissions a further 31% – a total of 53% from its projected 2030 emission levels under current policies. Without details as to how these cuts would be made, the 2035 target is hard to view as credible.

These credibility concerns are exacerbated when assessing the UAE NDC’s sectoral breakdown. This shows that most emissions reductions are expected to come from the buildings, industry and transport sectors, but the power sector will remain largely fossil fuel based, with an unrealistic reliance on CCS instead of renewables. There is no improvement on the renewables target.

The new NDC clarifies the overall contribution of negative emissions but does not clarify what proportion is technological based CDR versus what proportion is nature-based.

On 6 November 2024, the UAE submitted its 2035 NDC, setting an absolute target of reducing emissions to 103.5 MtCO2e, which represents a 47% reduction below 2019 levels. This target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from its assessment, resulting in a target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035.

The UAE's 2035 target itself is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway but new NDC did not increase the ambition of its 2030 emission reduction target, which is well above our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. The failure to substantially increase the ambition of the UAE’s 2030 targets raises serious concerns as to the credibility of its 2035 NDC given that a further 41%-point reduction (jumping from 7% to 48% below 2019 levels) would be needed in national emissions in only five years between 2030 and 2035. The serious lack of alignment between its 2030 and 2035 NDC means the country cannot claim to be on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap.

The UAE’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UAE’s 2035 target does represent a significant step forward in ambition compared to its 2030 target, leading to emissions dropping by 40% between 2030 and 2035.

The UAE’s 2035 target leads to 44% lower emissions in 2035 compared to 2019 across all sectors excluding LULUCF. However, the UAE has not increased its 2030 target, which represents only a 7% decrease in emissions below 2019. So, the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2035 are expected to happen in the five years between 2030 and 2035. The steep rate of emission reductions assumed between 2030 and 2035 make this 2035 target not credible if it is to be achieved domestically.

The target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035 is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway of 121.4 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. However, the 2030 target is well above that path. Hence the NDC trajectory is not compatible with global least cost 1.5 pathways.

The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste sectors. It outlines measures and plans to achieve emissions reductions in each sector against a 2019 baseline and is largely in line with what the UAE presented in its previous NDC as well as its LTS. However, the NDC does not present any new sectoral targets for 2035 beyond its emission reduction targets (e.g. no new renewable energy capacity targets).

Further information on the UAE’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

The UAE has communicated that it intends to provide and mobilise:

- USD 2 billion in grants and concessional loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries
- USD 1.2 billion for climate action alongside the Declaration on Climate, Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRR)
- USD 200 million to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust
- USD 100 million to the Loss & Damage Fund
- USD 30 billion to the Alterra fund for industrial decarbonization, climate technologies, sustainable living, and the energy transition
- USD 100 billion together with the US for its Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) which support renewable energy both at home and abroad
The UAE’s NDC showcases many of its contributions towards climate finance but does not present a clear overview of how much it plans to spend per year, how it will be distributed by sector/activities, and which regions will be targeted.


## Credibility

The UAE’s 2035 NDC target is supported by sectoral targets and measures that provide a degree of credibility to it. However, given that most emission reductions are expected to happen between 2030 and 2035, it raises the question whether the 9% annual change rate in emissions implied in the NDC target pathway is realistic.

The UAE will need to implement new policies to reach its 2035 target. Emissions under current policies are expected to be 48-57% or 102-148 MtCO2e above the NDC target in 2035. With the planned measures outlined in its LTS, it is possible that the UAE could come close to its 2035 NDC target, but open questions remain about the UAE’s measures to decarbonize its power and industry sectors, and the expected role of CCS.

The UAE is one of the world’s leading fossil fuel producers and exporters. While under its new NDC it plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels domestically, current plans by its state oil company (ADNOC) make it clear that the UAE plans to continue expanding its oil and gas activities.


## Transparency

The UAE’s NDC includes an absolute emissions target, which covers all gases and sectors of the economy. It also breaks down the target to the sectoral level to show the decarbonisation contribution expected of each sector. In its LTS, the UAE presents an emissions pathway which includes both its 2030 NDC target and its 2050 net zero target. However, a new version of this pathway was not included in the latest NDC to include the 2035 target.

The UAE includes an estimate of negative emissions in 2035, which includes both LULUCF and technological CDR such as direct air capture. Negative emissions are expected to reach 9.3 MtCO2e in 2035. In its previous NDC and its LTS, the UAE did clarify the contribution of each type of negative emissions. However, it does not clarify the contribution of each type to the total in its 2035 NDC target. Finally, the UAE reserves the use of carbon credits under article 6 of the Paris agreement, but does not commit to using credits, nor provides an estimate of how many it would use.

It is important to present separate targets for each of these elements, or at least to clearly identify their contribution to the NDC target. This helps to increase transparency and assess the credibility of the NDC target, as each of these negative emissions options come with their own set of advantages and limitations.

The lack of clarity on the contribution of each negative emissions technology makes it harder for the CAT to assess the UAE’s NDC target excluding LULUCF. To estimate the contribution of LULUCF to the UAE’s 2035 target, the CAT assumes agriculture emissions from 2021 (last reported year in the national GHG inventory) remain constant until 2035 (which is supported by the sectoral pathway presented int the UAE’s LTS which show all emissions reductions in the agriculture sector until 2035 will come from decarbonisation and reduction of its energy use) and then subtracts this value from the AFOLU estimate provided in the NDC. The estimated LULUCF emissions in 2035 using this method is -7.6 MtCO2e.

The UAE claims that the “target has been established in line with a 1.5 pathway in an effort to showcase the UAE’s best efforts” but does not explain how such a pathway was derived, which would require breaking the global goal of 1.5°C to the country level of the UAE.

UAE’s climate targets and policies

Guide to a good 2035 climate target


# Policies & action

**The** **CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.**

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies are set, in a best case scenario, to plateau close to 2022 levels, at around 214 MtCO2e, or continue to increase to about 259 MtCO2e. Under current policies, the UAE is set to miss its latest 2030 emissions reduction target. To meet its 2030 NDC target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions by a further 15–40%. However, if the UAE implements the planned policies outlined in both its NDC and LTS, it could potentially reach its target. For more information, please see the Assumptions tab.

Since 2023, the UAE has published information on many relevant climate policies across all sectors of the economy. Both its NDC from 2023 and its LTS from early 2024 provide details on policies and action, both current and planned, in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

This is a significant step in transparency, which allows for a better understanding of how the UAE plans to reduce its emissions to meet its NDC and net zero targets. However, it also shows a critical overreliance on carbon capture and storage both in the power and industry sectors, a smokescreen allowing the country to continue expanding its oil and fossil gas production and use while claiming to be on the way to net zero.

In recent years, the UAE has announced plans to invest in renewables both at home and abroad, including a USD 100bn commitment together with the United States (Associated Press, 2023). However, in parallel it continues to invest into fossil fuel production. The UAE is planning to significantly increase its oil production in the next years, and is pushing to reach “gas self-sufficiency”, with major investments in offshore gas production. In November 2022, ADNOC announced a USD 150bn investment plan to expand its oil and gas business in the next five years (The Guardian, 2023). As part of this plan, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17bn in October 2023 for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). For more details, see the Power sector section below.

The developments and the investment going towards new fossil fuel infrastructure are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, instead are likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition towards renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and switch to renewables, which would reduce prices and price volatility for consumers, and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).


## Power sector

The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce electricity emissions by 11% below 2019 levels by 2030. Under this sectoral target, emissions from electricity are expected to be ~68 MtCO2e in 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its LTS, the UAE includes additional information on its power sector plan, including a demand forecast of 211 TWh by 2030 and a grid coefficient of 0.27 tCO2e/MWh, a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline level of 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.

According to the UAE’s latest version of its Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS, the 2030 target will be mostly achieved by expanding renewables and nuclear. However, the achievement of the 2050 target of a zero-emissions grid coefficient is expected to rely heavily on the use of CCS on gas power plants, instead of a plan to phase out fossil fuels from power generation.

CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels and increases emissions, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants.

The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54 billion over the next seven years to support its updated energy targets. However, it remains unclear if the recently announced investment plan is additional to the USD 160 billion the country had previously announced to support its 2050 energy targets (Associated Press, 2023).

In May 2020, the construction of the first phase of the UAE and the Middle-East’s first coal power plant was completed. This consisted of the first two units of the 2.4 GW ultra-supercritical Hassyan power plant, with the second phase planned for Q3 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

In February 2022, the UAE announced that it would be switching its coal power plant to fossil gas, in support of its net zero target, and has reported that the plant, originally designed as a dual-fuel plant, has now done so (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

The UAE’s revised Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS all confirm that the country is not planning to include any coal power in its electricity mix.

The UAE continues to develop nuclear power. In October 2022, the third unit of the Barakah nuclear power plant went online, increasing total capacity to 4.2 GW. The last unit of the project, awarded to a South Korean consortium, came online in February 2023. Once the last unit is operational in 2025, the plant will increase its installed capacity to 5.6 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

According to a Reuters report from April 2024, the UAE is planning to tender a new nuclear power plant between this and next year, potentially including four reactors similarly to the existing Barakah power plant (Power Technology, 2024).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.

As part of its energy strategy, the UAE is planning to expand its renewables capacity, mostly through solar power. The UAE plans to reach 19.8 GW of renewables installed capacity in 2030, with an expected 33 TWh of generation, up from 6GW installed capacity in 2023 (IRENA, 2023).

It also set out a target to produce at least 30% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. This falls significantly short of the CAT 1.5°C compatible benchmark for the UAE, which sets renewable power generation at 66% of the total by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b; Government of the UAE, 2023b).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation

As part of its LTS, the UAE plans to roll out additional policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. These include CO2 emissions targets or caps for power producers through regulators at the emirate level, incentives for distributed power generation such as net metering, installing PV solar in public buildings, and tariff revisions to facilitate load balancing (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE also continues to invest in large scale solar power and storage. With its current and planned renewable energy developments, the UAE is expected to reach 9 GW of renewable power by 2030. Following the construction of the ~1.2 GW Noor Abu Dhabi solar PV plant in 2019, the UAE has continued to develop utility scale PV plants. The Al Dhafra Solar PV plant, added another 2 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Tollast, 2022). In May 2022, a third solar PV project entered the tendering process. Once completed, the Al Ajban Solar PV will add 1.5 GW of capacity (Technical Review Middle East, 2022).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE has also committed to invest around USD 160bn over the next three decades in “clean” and renewable energy, which might include nuclear and fossil gas. As part of this plan, the UAE has signed a preliminary agreement with Engie Solutions (subsidiary of Engie) to develop further clean energy projects (Benny, 2022).

In November 2022, the UAE signed the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) with the US, committing to mobilise USD 100bn to support the development of 100 GW of renewables both domestically and abroad by 2035. However, it is not yet clear which technologies will be supported under the “clean energy” concept, and how this new commitment will interact with existing finance plans in the UAE, that means, whether the planned investments will be additional to previous ones. In July 2023, the UAE announced it will be investing USD 54 billion to achieve its new 2030 clean energy target. Same as for the PACE announcement, it remains unclear whether this commitment is additional to existing ones (Associated Press, 2023).

In addition to these solar power projects, a contract for the UAE’s first pumped storage hydroelectric plant, with an expected capacity of 250 MW, was awarded in August 2019, and scheduled for commission in 2024 (Power Technology, 2022). Abu Dhabi’s virtual battery plant, currently with 108 MW of capacity, will also be expanded with an additional 300 MW in 2026.


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for ~19% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce transport emissions by 1% below 2019 levels by 2030. Emissions from the transport sector are expected to be ~42 MtCO2e in 2030 under this target, and to reach zero emissions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

The UAE has set out some policies to manage transport emissions, including an increase in the fuel and emissions efficiency of its vehicle fleet, as well incentives for the use of public transport, and the uptake of EVs. The revised Energy Strategy 2050 includes new targets for the uptake of EVs, including reaching 691,100 EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and over three million by 2050 as well as increasing the number of EV chargers to 879 by 2030 and 30k by 2050. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have also set out a series of urban transport policies, aimed among others at incentivising the uptake of public transport and EVs (Government of the UAE, 2021). For example, in May 2022 the Abu Dhabi government set out a new EV charging station policy, defining standards and requirements in anticipation of growing demand for EVs. In Dubai, the Green Mobility Strategy 2030 includes a target to reach 30% EVs and hybrids in the government vehicle fleet by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

In its LTS, the UAE lists additional policies it proposes to reach its target for the transport sector towards 2050. The key pillars of the UAE’s transport decarbonisation plan are to reduce transportation needs, decarbonise passenger transport, freight transport, and mechanical vehicles (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The first pillar will include the development of mixed-use buildings, improved infrastructure for cycling and walking, incentives for carpooling and increased use of public transport and rail. In total this will contribute 14% of the reductions needed to achieve the UAE’s target. The second pillar includes incentives for the uptake of EVs, the electrification of buses, taxis and motorcycles. In total this will contribute 22% of the emission reductions needed.

The decarbonisation of freight transport includes a shift towards more rail use as well as the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. These measures are expected to contribute 27% of the reductions needed. Finally, the electrification of mechanical vehicles is expected to contribute 28% of the reductions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

Additionally, the UAE has set out plans to decarbonise its domestic maritime and aviation sectors, including electrification and use of sustainable fuels.


## Industry

The industry sector, including oil and gas production, is the largest source of emissions in the UAE, accounting for 46% of the country’s total emissions, or 103 MtCO2e. This includes emissions from industrial processes as well as indirect emissions from power and heat generation (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The UAE’s LTS includes a target to reduce industry emissions by 5% below 2019 levels by 2030, and 93% by 2050, while its current policy projections estimate these emissions will rise by 18% above 2019 levels by 2030.

The UAE has a series of policies to reduce emissions from its industry sector, mostly focusing on increasing efficiency through adoption of best practices. To reach its target, the UAE plans to adopt a series of policies such as a cap and trade system, contracts for difference, regulated transport and storage for CCS, updated blended cement regulations, updated building codes, hydrogen production incentives and others (Government of the UAE, 2024b). On April 2024, the UAE also ratified the Kigali amendment, committing to reducing HFCs consumption by 87% by 2047 compared to its average consumption in 2024-2026 (IIR, 2024).

The UAE plans to reduce its industry emissions through different means. Around 20% of the reductions towards its net zero target will come from fuel substitution and process switches in key industries such as steel and cement (Government of the UAE, 2024b). For example, the UAE’s LTS mentions the switch to concentrated solar power for heat for industrial processes and switching from blast furnaces to hydrogen-powered direct reduced iron processes for steel.

However, a large share of the emissions reductions (32%) is expected to come directly from the deployment of CCS and from the decarbonisation of the power sector which will also heavily rely on CCS. Such overreliance on a technology that has not yet been proven at scale can seriously hinder the UAE’s progress towards transitioning its industry sector and can serve as a smokescreen to continue expanding fossil fuel production (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE is the world’s seventh largest oil producer and 14th largest gas producer (US EIA, 2023a). It is also one of the world’s largest oil exporters. The UAE’s exported emissions from oil and gas are about 2.5 times larger than its domestic emissions (see graph below) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023c).

In 2022, oil production reached 4.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (US EIA, 2023b). Following an OPEC+ decision in October 2022 (Deepthi Nair, 2022), to cut production by twomillion barrels per day (mbpd) in an effort to keep oil prices up the UAE announced it would cut over 140,000 barrels per day from May 2023 until the end of the year (Gulf Today, 2023). However, the government also recently announced it was bringing forward its oil production capacity of five mbpd target (up from 3.8 mbpd currently), from 2030 to 2025, signalling its intent to ramp up production in the short term (Di Paola, 2022).

The UAE is also developing oil and gas offshore exploration and production. This is part of its efforts to reach “gas self-sufficiency” (ICLG, 2022). In February 2022, the first offshore fields were discovered, which are estimated to contain between 43 and 57 billion cubic metres of gas (AFP, 2022).

During 2022, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Drilling was awarded almost USD 6bn in contracts to “maximise value from Abu Dhabi’s offshore oil and gas resources” (World-Energy, 2022). In October 2023, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17 bn for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). This is part of a USD 150bn ADNOC plan to increase production of oil and gas.

According to the IEA, the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure beyond what was already committed in 2021 is incompatible with reaching net zero by 2050 (IEA, 2021). The UAE’s plans to further develop and invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These plans are also likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition to renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).

In October 2023, ADNOC announced plans to double its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation plan (Energy Voice, 2023). In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

During COP26, the UAE unveiled its “Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap”, a strategy aimed at developing the domestic production of green and blue hydrogen aimed at export markets in Asia and Europe. The roadmap already includes seven projects which are either completed or underway (including blue ammonia production). The overarching target of the strategy is to reach a 25% market share in key markets such as India, Japan, Germany and others (H2 World News, 2021).

According to the UAE’s 2023 NDC update, several projects are already under way to support the country’s hydrogen ambitions, and a new Hydrogen Strategy is being prepared (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its updated Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE also includes a target to produce 1.4 Mt of hydrogen annually by 2031. The UAE’s LTS includes additional information on its hydrogen development plans, including production targets of 7.3 Mt by 2040 and 14.9 Mt by 2050. Around half of the hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels with CCS (blue hydrogen), with the majority of the second half being green hydrogen and a small share coming from nuclear power (pink hydrogen) (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Buildings

The buildings sector accounted for ~28% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce building emissions by 56% below 2019 levels by 2030, while its LTS targets a 98% reduction below 2019 levels by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). Emissions from the building sector are expected to be 27 MtCO2e in 2030 under the NDC from 2023, while under current policies they are expected to be 35 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE set out a target of reducing energy consumption by 40%. Several policies are in place to support this target in the buildings sector, including the National Water and Energy Demand Side Management Programme and a federal government building retrofit programme, aiming at 2000 retrofits by 2050. Some Emirates have also produced their own plans and policies to reduce energy consumption from the buildings sector, including Dubai’s plan to retrofit 30,000 buildings by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

The majority of the emissions reductions in the building sector towards the UAE’s NDC target are expected to come from energy efficiency measures including more efficient heating and cooling, as well as demand side management initiatives. The emissions reductions necessary to reach the LTS target of 1 MtCO2e in 2050 will come almost entirely from reducing power and heat emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Waste

According to the UAE’s latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the waste sector accounted for 6% of the country’s emissions in 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE’s LTS sets a target for waste emissions, which are set to increase by 8% above 2019 levels by 2030 and should decrease by 75% below 2019 levels in 2050. Emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach 14 MtCO2e in 2030, up from 13 MtCO2e in 2019 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). This includes emissions from landfills as well as emissions stemming from energy used to transport and treat waste.

In January 2021, the UAE launched its Circular Economy Policy 2031, establishing a Circular Economy Council, tasked with supervising the implementation of waste reduction policies that also target the manufacturing sector. In May 2022, the Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant was launched, with a capacity of 30 MW. A further 200 MW plant is planned in Dubai and a 70 MW plant in Abu Dhabi, both expected to be operational in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Sharma, 2022).

However, the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy has no concrete waste or emissions reduction targets. We were not able to check whether its previous target of diverting 75% of its waste from landfills by 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2019) has been achieved. The UAE’s LTS includes a target of diverting 80% of its waste by 2031 and 90% by 2035. It also plans to capture the remaining methane produced in its landfills and retrofitting its waste-to-energy plants with CCS.

Under its net zero scenario, the UAE expects waste to contribute around 3 MtCO2e by 2050.


## Methane

The UAE signed the methane pledge at COP26, in which signatories agreed to cut methane emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. According to the UAE’s latest inventory, methane represented ~7% of total GHG emissions in 2021, mostly stemming from upstream fossil fuel production and waste (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE already includes methane in its NDC and has some policies in place designed to reduce both energy and waste-related methane emissions.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2021 are taken from the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). For the years between 1994 and 2021 emissions are estimated by interpolating values between reported values. For the period 1990-1994 and 2021-2022 we estimate values by using growth rates from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024).

The UAE now includes an F-gases estimate in its latest national inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly related to data availability. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

The historical data used in our previous assessment estimated emissions to be around 15% higher in 2022 compared to our current assessment. The data from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024) was based on the UAE’s latest inventory published in 2016, and used different methods to fill the gaps in the inventory and extend the estimates until 2022. The new GHG inventory published by the UAE in 2024 presents a significant upgrade in terms of data quality. The difference in economy-wide emissions estimates is mostly explained by a decrease in industrial process emissions, which are roughly half in the UAE’s own inventory compared to PRIMAP in 2022, and to differences in fugitive emissions data for 2021. According to PRIMAP’s estimates, the emissions they calculated for the UAE in 2022 based on their old inventory are 98% higher than the ones calculated based on the UAE’s new inventory for 2022. The UAE’s old inventory published in 2015 (Ministry of Energy, 2015) includes estimates for 1994 and 2014, while the new inventory published in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2024a) includes an estimate only for 2021.


## NDC

The absolute emissions level for the NDC target incl. LULUCF is taken directly from the NDC document.

**F-gases**

Because F-gases are excluded from the UAE’s 2030 NDC target, the CAT adds them into the quantification of the NDC by assuming that F-gases remain constant from the last historical year (2021) until the target year (2030). The F-gases estimate comes from the UAE’s latest inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly due to data limitations. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

**LULUCF**

The target in the UAE’s 2023 NDC includes LULUCF emissions. To estimate the emissions level resulting from the target excluding LULUCF, we take the value for its 2030 LULUCF target (included in the NDC) and subtract it from the main NDC target.

**Global Warming Potential (GWP) values**

The UAE’s 2023 NDC specifies that it currently uses AR4 both for the BAU scenario and the NDC and sectoral targets. For the 2020 NDC, which was presented in SAR, we converted the 2030 BAU value from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor from the last available nationally reported historical data point (2021).


## Current policy projections

**Lower bound**

The UAE’s LTS includes current policy projections which are used as a baseline for the net zero scenario (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The current policy projections include all mitigation measures in force up to 2024 in all sectors of the economy, while the net zero scenario includes planned measures and their estimated contribution towards the target. The CAT uses the UAE’s LTS current policy scenario for the lower bound of its own current policy projections.

The CAT harmonizes the UAE’s LTS current policy scenarios to the latest available historical GHG emissions data (from 2022) using the growth rates of the original scenario for the period 2022-2035. The UAE only provided data for its current policies for the years 2019, 2030, 2040 and 2050. To create a pathway, the CAT linearly interpolates the values between these years.

Because the original projections include emissions and sinks from LULUCF, the CAT assumes that LULUCF emissions remain at 2019 levels (latest historical data available) under current policies. The UAE’s 2019 LULUCF emissions are -1 MtCO2e.

**Upper bound**

For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy.

The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures. For this projection, we estimate total power generation by technology using capacity factors estimated based on the IRENA REMAP BAU scenario (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015).

In summary, the CPP upper end of the range for the UAE’s energy-related CO2 emissions is based on assumptions both about which targets will be implemented, as well as the role of fossil gas in the development of the power system.

For CO2 process emissions (from industry), we continue a linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030 (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015). For non-CO2 emissions, we apply the growth rate from the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 to PRIMAP historical data (US EPA, 2019).

We use the following data sources in our estimates:

- Energy-related CO2 from fuel combustion: “Renewable Energy Prospects – United Arab Emirates” (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015)
- CO2 process emissions (from industry): Own assumption to continue linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030.
- Non-CO2 emissions: Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 (US EPA, 2019)
- Historical installed capacity data: IRENA capacity and generation statistics 2023 (IRENASTAT, 2023)
- Historical electricity generation data: IEA World Energy Balances 2022 (IEA, 2022)
- Historical emissions factors: IEA Emissions Factors 2021 (IEA, 2021a).

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UAE’s net zero strategy covers all GHG emissions except F-gases and assumes a 3.5 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target and so that is the value taken for their net zero target excluding LULUCF.

Due to the uncertainty in estimating F-gases emissions in the UAE by 2050, the CAT does not include any estimation when calculating the UAE’s 2050 emissions excluding LULUCF. This can change in future updates once new emissions data for historical years and future projections are available.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

The UAE submitted an updated NDC for 2030 in July 2023 after having already strengthened its NDC target in 2022. With the UAE’s emissions still set to increase by 2030, we estimate it will not be able to meet this updated NDC target, nor the former one.

The NDC from 2023 has an unconditional and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 182 MtCO2e (including emissions from land use and forestry, or LULUCF) by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). The CAT rates this target, excluding LULUCF, as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

In October 2021 the UAE announced its intention to reach net zero emissions as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s net zero target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero.


## NDC updates

The UAE submitted a 2035 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 06 November 2024. The CAT’s analysis of the UAE’s 2035 NDC target can be found here.

The UAE submitted a stronger 2030 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 11 July 2023. While the UAE needs to put forward substantially improved climate policies to reach the NDC, it is an improvement on the former NDC in the following ways:

- It includes strengthened emissions reduction target—to limit emissions to 182 MtCO2e by 2030 (including LULUCF), down from 208 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a).
- The target is now expressed as an absolute emissions limit. The previous target was a reduction below a business as usual (BAU) scenario.
- The NDC provides sectoral targets for the electricity and water generation, industry, transport, buildings, waste and agriculture sub-sectors.
- It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency.
We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The CAT’s calculation of the UAE’s 2030 NDC target also includes PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and HFCs which are not covered by the target. For this calculation, the CAT assumes that F-gases remain constant from the last available historical data point (2021). In its latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the UAE reported its latest GHG inventory covering the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2021. The F-gases value for 2021 is 0.15 MtCO2e in AR4 (Government of the UAE, 2024a).

This new target represents a targeted decrease in emissions of 14% below 2022 levels (excl. LULUCF).

The NDC mentions many of the policies and strategies that underpin the 2030 target. This includes the UAE’s National Energy Strategy 2050, which aims for 44% of renewable and 6% of nuclear energy in installed electric capacity by 2050, while reducing final electricity demand by 42–45% (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

This strategy was recently updated to remove its previous target of 12% of coal capacity by 2050, which is now replaced by an increased fossil gas capacity from 38% to 50%. This updated strategy continues to be inconsistent with the need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050, due to the continued long-term reliance on fossil gas (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

The UAE reserves the option to use carbon credits for emission reductions abroad under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own domestic emissions to achieve its NDC target (Government of the UAE, 2023a). Although it has not yet announced any firm details of how it will secure carbon credits towards its climate targets (either the NDC or net zero), a privately owned Emirati company called Blue Carbon has recently made headlines for its carbon credit deals. Since its inception in 2022, the company has signed MOU's with the governments of Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to acquire conservation rights for around 60 million acres of their forests, to generate carbon credits from projects avoiding deforestation, and sell them on the market (Pearce, 2023).

Details on how the government of the UAE intends to purchase credits from Blue Carbon or other similar providers to support claims to offset its own emissions are unclear. This ambiguity presents major risks that the UAE will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. The use of credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should complement and not serve to distract from or displace critically needed mitigation efforts domestically.

The UAE’s 2030 NDC submitted in 2023 shows an increase in ambition and has improved its transparency by sharing sectoral targets and more details on the measures planned to achieve them. However, the UAE’s current plans for its oil and gas industry and its power sector continue to be incompatible with its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

- 29.12.2020 The UAE submits an updated NDC with first economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and "Insufficient" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways.

CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update.

For more details, please see the Assumptions section.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023).

We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.


# Summary


## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Targets


## Target Overview

The UAE submitted an updated NDC for 2030 in July 2023 after having already strengthened its NDC target in 2022. With the UAE’s emissions still set to increase by 2030, we estimate it will not be able to meet this updated NDC target, nor the former one.

The NDC from 2023 has an unconditional and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 182 MtCO2e (including emissions from land use and forestry, or LULUCF) by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). The CAT rates this target, excluding LULUCF, as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

In October 2021 the UAE announced its intention to reach net zero emissions as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s net zero target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero.


## NDC updates

The UAE submitted a 2035 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 06 November 2024. The CAT’s analysis of the UAE’s 2035 NDC target can be found here.

The UAE submitted a stronger 2030 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 11 July 2023. While the UAE needs to put forward substantially improved climate policies to reach the NDC, it is an improvement on the former NDC in the following ways:

- It includes strengthened emissions reduction target—to limit emissions to 182 MtCO2e by 2030 (including LULUCF), down from 208 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a).
- The target is now expressed as an absolute emissions limit. The previous target was a reduction below a business as usual (BAU) scenario.
- The NDC provides sectoral targets for the electricity and water generation, industry, transport, buildings, waste and agriculture sub-sectors.
- It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency.
We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The CAT’s calculation of the UAE’s 2030 NDC target also includes PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and HFCs which are not covered by the target. For this calculation, the CAT assumes that F-gases remain constant from the last available historical data point (2021). In its latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the UAE reported its latest GHG inventory covering the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2021. The F-gases value for 2021 is 0.15 MtCO2e in AR4 (Government of the UAE, 2024a).

This new target represents a targeted decrease in emissions of 14% below 2022 levels (excl. LULUCF).

The NDC mentions many of the policies and strategies that underpin the 2030 target. This includes the UAE’s National Energy Strategy 2050, which aims for 44% of renewable and 6% of nuclear energy in installed electric capacity by 2050, while reducing final electricity demand by 42–45% (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

This strategy was recently updated to remove its previous target of 12% of coal capacity by 2050, which is now replaced by an increased fossil gas capacity from 38% to 50%. This updated strategy continues to be inconsistent with the need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050, due to the continued long-term reliance on fossil gas (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

The UAE reserves the option to use carbon credits for emission reductions abroad under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own domestic emissions to achieve its NDC target (Government of the UAE, 2023a). Although it has not yet announced any firm details of how it will secure carbon credits towards its climate targets (either the NDC or net zero), a privately owned Emirati company called Blue Carbon has recently made headlines for its carbon credit deals. Since its inception in 2022, the company has signed MOU's with the governments of Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to acquire conservation rights for around 60 million acres of their forests, to generate carbon credits from projects avoiding deforestation, and sell them on the market (Pearce, 2023).

Details on how the government of the UAE intends to purchase credits from Blue Carbon or other similar providers to support claims to offset its own emissions are unclear. This ambiguity presents major risks that the UAE will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. The use of credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should complement and not serve to distract from or displace critically needed mitigation efforts domestically.

The UAE’s 2030 NDC submitted in 2023 shows an increase in ambition and has improved its transparency by sharing sectoral targets and more details on the measures planned to achieve them. However, the UAE’s current plans for its oil and gas industry and its power sector continue to be incompatible with its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

- 29.12.2020 The UAE submits an updated NDC with first economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and "Insufficient" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways.

CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update.

For more details, please see the Assumptions section.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023).

We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

The UAE has not updated its 2030 NDC to match the new 2035 NDC, which implies going from a 7% reduction in 2030 to a 44% reduction in 2035, below 2019 levels.

The UAE is not on track to meet its 2030 target under our current policy projections, needing an emissions reduction of 22% to meet its 2030 target. To meet its 2035 target, the UAE would need to reduce its emissions a further 31% – a total of 53% from its projected 2030 emission levels under current policies. Without details as to how these cuts would be made, the 2035 target is hard to view as credible.

These credibility concerns are exacerbated when assessing the UAE NDC’s sectoral breakdown. This shows that most emissions reductions are expected to come from the buildings, industry and transport sectors, but the power sector will remain largely fossil fuel based, with an unrealistic reliance on CCS instead of renewables. There is no improvement on the renewables target.

The new NDC clarifies the overall contribution of negative emissions but does not clarify what proportion is technological based CDR versus what proportion is nature-based.

On 6 November 2024, the UAE submitted its 2035 NDC, setting an absolute target of reducing emissions to 103.5 MtCO2e, which represents a 47% reduction below 2019 levels. This target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from its assessment, resulting in a target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035.

The UAE's 2035 target itself is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway but new NDC did not increase the ambition of its 2030 emission reduction target, which is well above our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. The failure to substantially increase the ambition of the UAE’s 2030 targets raises serious concerns as to the credibility of its 2035 NDC given that a further 41%-point reduction (jumping from 7% to 48% below 2019 levels) would be needed in national emissions in only five years between 2030 and 2035. The serious lack of alignment between its 2030 and 2035 NDC means the country cannot claim to be on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap.

The UAE’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UAE’s 2035 target does represent a significant step forward in ambition compared to its 2030 target, leading to emissions dropping by 40% between 2030 and 2035.

The UAE’s 2035 target leads to 44% lower emissions in 2035 compared to 2019 across all sectors excluding LULUCF. However, the UAE has not increased its 2030 target, which represents only a 7% decrease in emissions below 2019. So, the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2035 are expected to happen in the five years between 2030 and 2035. The steep rate of emission reductions assumed between 2030 and 2035 make this 2035 target not credible if it is to be achieved domestically.

The target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035 is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway of 121.4 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. However, the 2030 target is well above that path. Hence the NDC trajectory is not compatible with global least cost 1.5 pathways.

The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste sectors. It outlines measures and plans to achieve emissions reductions in each sector against a 2019 baseline and is largely in line with what the UAE presented in its previous NDC as well as its LTS. However, the NDC does not present any new sectoral targets for 2035 beyond its emission reduction targets (e.g. no new renewable energy capacity targets).

Further information on the UAE’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

The UAE has communicated that it intends to provide and mobilise:

- USD 2 billion in grants and concessional loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries
- USD 1.2 billion for climate action alongside the Declaration on Climate, Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRR)
- USD 200 million to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust
- USD 100 million to the Loss & Damage Fund
- USD 30 billion to the Alterra fund for industrial decarbonization, climate technologies, sustainable living, and the energy transition
- USD 100 billion together with the US for its Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) which support renewable energy both at home and abroad
The UAE’s NDC showcases many of its contributions towards climate finance but does not present a clear overview of how much it plans to spend per year, how it will be distributed by sector/activities, and which regions will be targeted.


## Credibility

The UAE’s 2035 NDC target is supported by sectoral targets and measures that provide a degree of credibility to it. However, given that most emission reductions are expected to happen between 2030 and 2035, it raises the question whether the 9% annual change rate in emissions implied in the NDC target pathway is realistic.

The UAE will need to implement new policies to reach its 2035 target. Emissions under current policies are expected to be 48-57% or 102-148 MtCO2e above the NDC target in 2035. With the planned measures outlined in its LTS, it is possible that the UAE could come close to its 2035 NDC target, but open questions remain about the UAE’s measures to decarbonize its power and industry sectors, and the expected role of CCS.

The UAE is one of the world’s leading fossil fuel producers and exporters. While under its new NDC it plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels domestically, current plans by its state oil company (ADNOC) make it clear that the UAE plans to continue expanding its oil and gas activities.


## Transparency

The UAE’s NDC includes an absolute emissions target, which covers all gases and sectors of the economy. It also breaks down the target to the sectoral level to show the decarbonisation contribution expected of each sector. In its LTS, the UAE presents an emissions pathway which includes both its 2030 NDC target and its 2050 net zero target. However, a new version of this pathway was not included in the latest NDC to include the 2035 target.

The UAE includes an estimate of negative emissions in 2035, which includes both LULUCF and technological CDR such as direct air capture. Negative emissions are expected to reach 9.3 MtCO2e in 2035. In its previous NDC and its LTS, the UAE did clarify the contribution of each type of negative emissions. However, it does not clarify the contribution of each type to the total in its 2035 NDC target. Finally, the UAE reserves the use of carbon credits under article 6 of the Paris agreement, but does not commit to using credits, nor provides an estimate of how many it would use.

It is important to present separate targets for each of these elements, or at least to clearly identify their contribution to the NDC target. This helps to increase transparency and assess the credibility of the NDC target, as each of these negative emissions options come with their own set of advantages and limitations.

The lack of clarity on the contribution of each negative emissions technology makes it harder for the CAT to assess the UAE’s NDC target excluding LULUCF. To estimate the contribution of LULUCF to the UAE’s 2035 target, the CAT assumes agriculture emissions from 2021 (last reported year in the national GHG inventory) remain constant until 2035 (which is supported by the sectoral pathway presented int the UAE’s LTS which show all emissions reductions in the agriculture sector until 2035 will come from decarbonisation and reduction of its energy use) and then subtracts this value from the AFOLU estimate provided in the NDC. The estimated LULUCF emissions in 2035 using this method is -7.6 MtCO2e.

The UAE claims that the “target has been established in line with a 1.5 pathway in an effort to showcase the UAE’s best efforts” but does not explain how such a pathway was derived, which would require breaking the global goal of 1.5°C to the country level of the UAE.

UAE’s climate targets and policies

Guide to a good 2035 climate target


# Policies & action

**The** **CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.**

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies are set, in a best case scenario, to plateau close to 2022 levels, at around 214 MtCO2e, or continue to increase to about 259 MtCO2e. Under current policies, the UAE is set to miss its latest 2030 emissions reduction target. To meet its 2030 NDC target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions by a further 15–40%. However, if the UAE implements the planned policies outlined in both its NDC and LTS, it could potentially reach its target. For more information, please see the Assumptions tab.

Since 2023, the UAE has published information on many relevant climate policies across all sectors of the economy. Both its NDC from 2023 and its LTS from early 2024 provide details on policies and action, both current and planned, in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

This is a significant step in transparency, which allows for a better understanding of how the UAE plans to reduce its emissions to meet its NDC and net zero targets. However, it also shows a critical overreliance on carbon capture and storage both in the power and industry sectors, a smokescreen allowing the country to continue expanding its oil and fossil gas production and use while claiming to be on the way to net zero.

In recent years, the UAE has announced plans to invest in renewables both at home and abroad, including a USD 100bn commitment together with the United States (Associated Press, 2023). However, in parallel it continues to invest into fossil fuel production. The UAE is planning to significantly increase its oil production in the next years, and is pushing to reach “gas self-sufficiency”, with major investments in offshore gas production. In November 2022, ADNOC announced a USD 150bn investment plan to expand its oil and gas business in the next five years (The Guardian, 2023). As part of this plan, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17bn in October 2023 for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). For more details, see the Power sector section below.

The developments and the investment going towards new fossil fuel infrastructure are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, instead are likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition towards renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and switch to renewables, which would reduce prices and price volatility for consumers, and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).


## Power sector

The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce electricity emissions by 11% below 2019 levels by 2030. Under this sectoral target, emissions from electricity are expected to be ~68 MtCO2e in 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its LTS, the UAE includes additional information on its power sector plan, including a demand forecast of 211 TWh by 2030 and a grid coefficient of 0.27 tCO2e/MWh, a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline level of 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.

According to the UAE’s latest version of its Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS, the 2030 target will be mostly achieved by expanding renewables and nuclear. However, the achievement of the 2050 target of a zero-emissions grid coefficient is expected to rely heavily on the use of CCS on gas power plants, instead of a plan to phase out fossil fuels from power generation.

CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels and increases emissions, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants.

The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54 billion over the next seven years to support its updated energy targets. However, it remains unclear if the recently announced investment plan is additional to the USD 160 billion the country had previously announced to support its 2050 energy targets (Associated Press, 2023).

In May 2020, the construction of the first phase of the UAE and the Middle-East’s first coal power plant was completed. This consisted of the first two units of the 2.4 GW ultra-supercritical Hassyan power plant, with the second phase planned for Q3 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

In February 2022, the UAE announced that it would be switching its coal power plant to fossil gas, in support of its net zero target, and has reported that the plant, originally designed as a dual-fuel plant, has now done so (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

The UAE’s revised Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS all confirm that the country is not planning to include any coal power in its electricity mix.

The UAE continues to develop nuclear power. In October 2022, the third unit of the Barakah nuclear power plant went online, increasing total capacity to 4.2 GW. The last unit of the project, awarded to a South Korean consortium, came online in February 2023. Once the last unit is operational in 2025, the plant will increase its installed capacity to 5.6 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

According to a Reuters report from April 2024, the UAE is planning to tender a new nuclear power plant between this and next year, potentially including four reactors similarly to the existing Barakah power plant (Power Technology, 2024).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.

As part of its energy strategy, the UAE is planning to expand its renewables capacity, mostly through solar power. The UAE plans to reach 19.8 GW of renewables installed capacity in 2030, with an expected 33 TWh of generation, up from 6GW installed capacity in 2023 (IRENA, 2023).

It also set out a target to produce at least 30% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. This falls significantly short of the CAT 1.5°C compatible benchmark for the UAE, which sets renewable power generation at 66% of the total by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b; Government of the UAE, 2023b).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation

As part of its LTS, the UAE plans to roll out additional policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. These include CO2 emissions targets or caps for power producers through regulators at the emirate level, incentives for distributed power generation such as net metering, installing PV solar in public buildings, and tariff revisions to facilitate load balancing (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE also continues to invest in large scale solar power and storage. With its current and planned renewable energy developments, the UAE is expected to reach 9 GW of renewable power by 2030. Following the construction of the ~1.2 GW Noor Abu Dhabi solar PV plant in 2019, the UAE has continued to develop utility scale PV plants. The Al Dhafra Solar PV plant, added another 2 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Tollast, 2022). In May 2022, a third solar PV project entered the tendering process. Once completed, the Al Ajban Solar PV will add 1.5 GW of capacity (Technical Review Middle East, 2022).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE has also committed to invest around USD 160bn over the next three decades in “clean” and renewable energy, which might include nuclear and fossil gas. As part of this plan, the UAE has signed a preliminary agreement with Engie Solutions (subsidiary of Engie) to develop further clean energy projects (Benny, 2022).

In November 2022, the UAE signed the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) with the US, committing to mobilise USD 100bn to support the development of 100 GW of renewables both domestically and abroad by 2035. However, it is not yet clear which technologies will be supported under the “clean energy” concept, and how this new commitment will interact with existing finance plans in the UAE, that means, whether the planned investments will be additional to previous ones. In July 2023, the UAE announced it will be investing USD 54 billion to achieve its new 2030 clean energy target. Same as for the PACE announcement, it remains unclear whether this commitment is additional to existing ones (Associated Press, 2023).

In addition to these solar power projects, a contract for the UAE’s first pumped storage hydroelectric plant, with an expected capacity of 250 MW, was awarded in August 2019, and scheduled for commission in 2024 (Power Technology, 2022). Abu Dhabi’s virtual battery plant, currently with 108 MW of capacity, will also be expanded with an additional 300 MW in 2026.


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for ~19% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce transport emissions by 1% below 2019 levels by 2030. Emissions from the transport sector are expected to be ~42 MtCO2e in 2030 under this target, and to reach zero emissions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

The UAE has set out some policies to manage transport emissions, including an increase in the fuel and emissions efficiency of its vehicle fleet, as well incentives for the use of public transport, and the uptake of EVs. The revised Energy Strategy 2050 includes new targets for the uptake of EVs, including reaching 691,100 EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and over three million by 2050 as well as increasing the number of EV chargers to 879 by 2030 and 30k by 2050. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have also set out a series of urban transport policies, aimed among others at incentivising the uptake of public transport and EVs (Government of the UAE, 2021). For example, in May 2022 the Abu Dhabi government set out a new EV charging station policy, defining standards and requirements in anticipation of growing demand for EVs. In Dubai, the Green Mobility Strategy 2030 includes a target to reach 30% EVs and hybrids in the government vehicle fleet by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

In its LTS, the UAE lists additional policies it proposes to reach its target for the transport sector towards 2050. The key pillars of the UAE’s transport decarbonisation plan are to reduce transportation needs, decarbonise passenger transport, freight transport, and mechanical vehicles (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The first pillar will include the development of mixed-use buildings, improved infrastructure for cycling and walking, incentives for carpooling and increased use of public transport and rail. In total this will contribute 14% of the reductions needed to achieve the UAE’s target. The second pillar includes incentives for the uptake of EVs, the electrification of buses, taxis and motorcycles. In total this will contribute 22% of the emission reductions needed.

The decarbonisation of freight transport includes a shift towards more rail use as well as the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. These measures are expected to contribute 27% of the reductions needed. Finally, the electrification of mechanical vehicles is expected to contribute 28% of the reductions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

Additionally, the UAE has set out plans to decarbonise its domestic maritime and aviation sectors, including electrification and use of sustainable fuels.


## Industry

The industry sector, including oil and gas production, is the largest source of emissions in the UAE, accounting for 46% of the country’s total emissions, or 103 MtCO2e. This includes emissions from industrial processes as well as indirect emissions from power and heat generation (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The UAE’s LTS includes a target to reduce industry emissions by 5% below 2019 levels by 2030, and 93% by 2050, while its current policy projections estimate these emissions will rise by 18% above 2019 levels by 2030.

The UAE has a series of policies to reduce emissions from its industry sector, mostly focusing on increasing efficiency through adoption of best practices. To reach its target, the UAE plans to adopt a series of policies such as a cap and trade system, contracts for difference, regulated transport and storage for CCS, updated blended cement regulations, updated building codes, hydrogen production incentives and others (Government of the UAE, 2024b). On April 2024, the UAE also ratified the Kigali amendment, committing to reducing HFCs consumption by 87% by 2047 compared to its average consumption in 2024-2026 (IIR, 2024).

The UAE plans to reduce its industry emissions through different means. Around 20% of the reductions towards its net zero target will come from fuel substitution and process switches in key industries such as steel and cement (Government of the UAE, 2024b). For example, the UAE’s LTS mentions the switch to concentrated solar power for heat for industrial processes and switching from blast furnaces to hydrogen-powered direct reduced iron processes for steel.

However, a large share of the emissions reductions (32%) is expected to come directly from the deployment of CCS and from the decarbonisation of the power sector which will also heavily rely on CCS. Such overreliance on a technology that has not yet been proven at scale can seriously hinder the UAE’s progress towards transitioning its industry sector and can serve as a smokescreen to continue expanding fossil fuel production (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE is the world’s seventh largest oil producer and 14th largest gas producer (US EIA, 2023a). It is also one of the world’s largest oil exporters. The UAE’s exported emissions from oil and gas are about 2.5 times larger than its domestic emissions (see graph below) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023c).

In 2022, oil production reached 4.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (US EIA, 2023b). Following an OPEC+ decision in October 2022 (Deepthi Nair, 2022), to cut production by twomillion barrels per day (mbpd) in an effort to keep oil prices up the UAE announced it would cut over 140,000 barrels per day from May 2023 until the end of the year (Gulf Today, 2023). However, the government also recently announced it was bringing forward its oil production capacity of five mbpd target (up from 3.8 mbpd currently), from 2030 to 2025, signalling its intent to ramp up production in the short term (Di Paola, 2022).

The UAE is also developing oil and gas offshore exploration and production. This is part of its efforts to reach “gas self-sufficiency” (ICLG, 2022). In February 2022, the first offshore fields were discovered, which are estimated to contain between 43 and 57 billion cubic metres of gas (AFP, 2022).

During 2022, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Drilling was awarded almost USD 6bn in contracts to “maximise value from Abu Dhabi’s offshore oil and gas resources” (World-Energy, 2022). In October 2023, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17 bn for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). This is part of a USD 150bn ADNOC plan to increase production of oil and gas.

According to the IEA, the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure beyond what was already committed in 2021 is incompatible with reaching net zero by 2050 (IEA, 2021). The UAE’s plans to further develop and invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These plans are also likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition to renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).

In October 2023, ADNOC announced plans to double its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation plan (Energy Voice, 2023). In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

During COP26, the UAE unveiled its “Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap”, a strategy aimed at developing the domestic production of green and blue hydrogen aimed at export markets in Asia and Europe. The roadmap already includes seven projects which are either completed or underway (including blue ammonia production). The overarching target of the strategy is to reach a 25% market share in key markets such as India, Japan, Germany and others (H2 World News, 2021).

According to the UAE’s 2023 NDC update, several projects are already under way to support the country’s hydrogen ambitions, and a new Hydrogen Strategy is being prepared (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its updated Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE also includes a target to produce 1.4 Mt of hydrogen annually by 2031. The UAE’s LTS includes additional information on its hydrogen development plans, including production targets of 7.3 Mt by 2040 and 14.9 Mt by 2050. Around half of the hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels with CCS (blue hydrogen), with the majority of the second half being green hydrogen and a small share coming from nuclear power (pink hydrogen) (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Buildings

The buildings sector accounted for ~28% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce building emissions by 56% below 2019 levels by 2030, while its LTS targets a 98% reduction below 2019 levels by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). Emissions from the building sector are expected to be 27 MtCO2e in 2030 under the NDC from 2023, while under current policies they are expected to be 35 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE set out a target of reducing energy consumption by 40%. Several policies are in place to support this target in the buildings sector, including the National Water and Energy Demand Side Management Programme and a federal government building retrofit programme, aiming at 2000 retrofits by 2050. Some Emirates have also produced their own plans and policies to reduce energy consumption from the buildings sector, including Dubai’s plan to retrofit 30,000 buildings by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

The majority of the emissions reductions in the building sector towards the UAE’s NDC target are expected to come from energy efficiency measures including more efficient heating and cooling, as well as demand side management initiatives. The emissions reductions necessary to reach the LTS target of 1 MtCO2e in 2050 will come almost entirely from reducing power and heat emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Waste

According to the UAE’s latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the waste sector accounted for 6% of the country’s emissions in 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE’s LTS sets a target for waste emissions, which are set to increase by 8% above 2019 levels by 2030 and should decrease by 75% below 2019 levels in 2050. Emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach 14 MtCO2e in 2030, up from 13 MtCO2e in 2019 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). This includes emissions from landfills as well as emissions stemming from energy used to transport and treat waste.

In January 2021, the UAE launched its Circular Economy Policy 2031, establishing a Circular Economy Council, tasked with supervising the implementation of waste reduction policies that also target the manufacturing sector. In May 2022, the Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant was launched, with a capacity of 30 MW. A further 200 MW plant is planned in Dubai and a 70 MW plant in Abu Dhabi, both expected to be operational in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Sharma, 2022).

However, the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy has no concrete waste or emissions reduction targets. We were not able to check whether its previous target of diverting 75% of its waste from landfills by 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2019) has been achieved. The UAE’s LTS includes a target of diverting 80% of its waste by 2031 and 90% by 2035. It also plans to capture the remaining methane produced in its landfills and retrofitting its waste-to-energy plants with CCS.

Under its net zero scenario, the UAE expects waste to contribute around 3 MtCO2e by 2050.


## Methane

The UAE signed the methane pledge at COP26, in which signatories agreed to cut methane emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. According to the UAE’s latest inventory, methane represented ~7% of total GHG emissions in 2021, mostly stemming from upstream fossil fuel production and waste (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE already includes methane in its NDC and has some policies in place designed to reduce both energy and waste-related methane emissions.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2021 are taken from the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). For the years between 1994 and 2021 emissions are estimated by interpolating values between reported values. For the period 1990-1994 and 2021-2022 we estimate values by using growth rates from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024).

The UAE now includes an F-gases estimate in its latest national inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly related to data availability. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

The historical data used in our previous assessment estimated emissions to be around 15% higher in 2022 compared to our current assessment. The data from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024) was based on the UAE’s latest inventory published in 2016, and used different methods to fill the gaps in the inventory and extend the estimates until 2022. The new GHG inventory published by the UAE in 2024 presents a significant upgrade in terms of data quality. The difference in economy-wide emissions estimates is mostly explained by a decrease in industrial process emissions, which are roughly half in the UAE’s own inventory compared to PRIMAP in 2022, and to differences in fugitive emissions data for 2021. According to PRIMAP’s estimates, the emissions they calculated for the UAE in 2022 based on their old inventory are 98% higher than the ones calculated based on the UAE’s new inventory for 2022. The UAE’s old inventory published in 2015 (Ministry of Energy, 2015) includes estimates for 1994 and 2014, while the new inventory published in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2024a) includes an estimate only for 2021.


## NDC

The absolute emissions level for the NDC target incl. LULUCF is taken directly from the NDC document.

**F-gases**

Because F-gases are excluded from the UAE’s 2030 NDC target, the CAT adds them into the quantification of the NDC by assuming that F-gases remain constant from the last historical year (2021) until the target year (2030). The F-gases estimate comes from the UAE’s latest inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly due to data limitations. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

**LULUCF**

The target in the UAE’s 2023 NDC includes LULUCF emissions. To estimate the emissions level resulting from the target excluding LULUCF, we take the value for its 2030 LULUCF target (included in the NDC) and subtract it from the main NDC target.

**Global Warming Potential (GWP) values**

The UAE’s 2023 NDC specifies that it currently uses AR4 both for the BAU scenario and the NDC and sectoral targets. For the 2020 NDC, which was presented in SAR, we converted the 2030 BAU value from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor from the last available nationally reported historical data point (2021).


## Current policy projections

**Lower bound**

The UAE’s LTS includes current policy projections which are used as a baseline for the net zero scenario (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The current policy projections include all mitigation measures in force up to 2024 in all sectors of the economy, while the net zero scenario includes planned measures and their estimated contribution towards the target. The CAT uses the UAE’s LTS current policy scenario for the lower bound of its own current policy projections.

The CAT harmonizes the UAE’s LTS current policy scenarios to the latest available historical GHG emissions data (from 2022) using the growth rates of the original scenario for the period 2022-2035. The UAE only provided data for its current policies for the years 2019, 2030, 2040 and 2050. To create a pathway, the CAT linearly interpolates the values between these years.

Because the original projections include emissions and sinks from LULUCF, the CAT assumes that LULUCF emissions remain at 2019 levels (latest historical data available) under current policies. The UAE’s 2019 LULUCF emissions are -1 MtCO2e.

**Upper bound**

For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy.

The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures. For this projection, we estimate total power generation by technology using capacity factors estimated based on the IRENA REMAP BAU scenario (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015).

In summary, the CPP upper end of the range for the UAE’s energy-related CO2 emissions is based on assumptions both about which targets will be implemented, as well as the role of fossil gas in the development of the power system.

For CO2 process emissions (from industry), we continue a linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030 (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015). For non-CO2 emissions, we apply the growth rate from the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 to PRIMAP historical data (US EPA, 2019).

We use the following data sources in our estimates:

- Energy-related CO2 from fuel combustion: “Renewable Energy Prospects – United Arab Emirates” (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015)
- CO2 process emissions (from industry): Own assumption to continue linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030.
- Non-CO2 emissions: Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 (US EPA, 2019)
- Historical installed capacity data: IRENA capacity and generation statistics 2023 (IRENASTAT, 2023)
- Historical electricity generation data: IEA World Energy Balances 2022 (IEA, 2022)
- Historical emissions factors: IEA Emissions Factors 2021 (IEA, 2021a).

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UAE’s net zero strategy covers all GHG emissions except F-gases and assumes a 3.5 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target and so that is the value taken for their net zero target excluding LULUCF.

Due to the uncertainty in estimating F-gases emissions in the UAE by 2050, the CAT does not include any estimation when calculating the UAE’s 2050 emissions excluding LULUCF. This can change in future updates once new emissions data for historical years and future projections are available.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Summary


## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

The UAE has not updated its 2030 NDC to match the new 2035 NDC, which implies going from a 7% reduction in 2030 to a 44% reduction in 2035, below 2019 levels.

The UAE is not on track to meet its 2030 target under our current policy projections, needing an emissions reduction of 22% to meet its 2030 target. To meet its 2035 target, the UAE would need to reduce its emissions a further 31% – a total of 53% from its projected 2030 emission levels under current policies. Without details as to how these cuts would be made, the 2035 target is hard to view as credible.

These credibility concerns are exacerbated when assessing the UAE NDC’s sectoral breakdown. This shows that most emissions reductions are expected to come from the buildings, industry and transport sectors, but the power sector will remain largely fossil fuel based, with an unrealistic reliance on CCS instead of renewables. There is no improvement on the renewables target.

The new NDC clarifies the overall contribution of negative emissions but does not clarify what proportion is technological based CDR versus what proportion is nature-based.

On 6 November 2024, the UAE submitted its 2035 NDC, setting an absolute target of reducing emissions to 103.5 MtCO2e, which represents a 47% reduction below 2019 levels. This target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from its assessment, resulting in a target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035.

The UAE's 2035 target itself is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway but new NDC did not increase the ambition of its 2030 emission reduction target, which is well above our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. The failure to substantially increase the ambition of the UAE’s 2030 targets raises serious concerns as to the credibility of its 2035 NDC given that a further 41%-point reduction (jumping from 7% to 48% below 2019 levels) would be needed in national emissions in only five years between 2030 and 2035. The serious lack of alignment between its 2030 and 2035 NDC means the country cannot claim to be on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap.

The UAE’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UAE’s 2035 target does represent a significant step forward in ambition compared to its 2030 target, leading to emissions dropping by 40% between 2030 and 2035.

The UAE’s 2035 target leads to 44% lower emissions in 2035 compared to 2019 across all sectors excluding LULUCF. However, the UAE has not increased its 2030 target, which represents only a 7% decrease in emissions below 2019. So, the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2035 are expected to happen in the five years between 2030 and 2035. The steep rate of emission reductions assumed between 2030 and 2035 make this 2035 target not credible if it is to be achieved domestically.

The target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035 is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway of 121.4 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. However, the 2030 target is well above that path. Hence the NDC trajectory is not compatible with global least cost 1.5 pathways.

The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste sectors. It outlines measures and plans to achieve emissions reductions in each sector against a 2019 baseline and is largely in line with what the UAE presented in its previous NDC as well as its LTS. However, the NDC does not present any new sectoral targets for 2035 beyond its emission reduction targets (e.g. no new renewable energy capacity targets).

Further information on the UAE’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

The UAE has communicated that it intends to provide and mobilise:

- USD 2 billion in grants and concessional loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries
- USD 1.2 billion for climate action alongside the Declaration on Climate, Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRR)
- USD 200 million to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust
- USD 100 million to the Loss & Damage Fund
- USD 30 billion to the Alterra fund for industrial decarbonization, climate technologies, sustainable living, and the energy transition
- USD 100 billion together with the US for its Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) which support renewable energy both at home and abroad
The UAE’s NDC showcases many of its contributions towards climate finance but does not present a clear overview of how much it plans to spend per year, how it will be distributed by sector/activities, and which regions will be targeted.


## Credibility

The UAE’s 2035 NDC target is supported by sectoral targets and measures that provide a degree of credibility to it. However, given that most emission reductions are expected to happen between 2030 and 2035, it raises the question whether the 9% annual change rate in emissions implied in the NDC target pathway is realistic.

The UAE will need to implement new policies to reach its 2035 target. Emissions under current policies are expected to be 48-57% or 102-148 MtCO2e above the NDC target in 2035. With the planned measures outlined in its LTS, it is possible that the UAE could come close to its 2035 NDC target, but open questions remain about the UAE’s measures to decarbonize its power and industry sectors, and the expected role of CCS.

The UAE is one of the world’s leading fossil fuel producers and exporters. While under its new NDC it plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels domestically, current plans by its state oil company (ADNOC) make it clear that the UAE plans to continue expanding its oil and gas activities.


## Transparency

The UAE’s NDC includes an absolute emissions target, which covers all gases and sectors of the economy. It also breaks down the target to the sectoral level to show the decarbonisation contribution expected of each sector. In its LTS, the UAE presents an emissions pathway which includes both its 2030 NDC target and its 2050 net zero target. However, a new version of this pathway was not included in the latest NDC to include the 2035 target.

The UAE includes an estimate of negative emissions in 2035, which includes both LULUCF and technological CDR such as direct air capture. Negative emissions are expected to reach 9.3 MtCO2e in 2035. In its previous NDC and its LTS, the UAE did clarify the contribution of each type of negative emissions. However, it does not clarify the contribution of each type to the total in its 2035 NDC target. Finally, the UAE reserves the use of carbon credits under article 6 of the Paris agreement, but does not commit to using credits, nor provides an estimate of how many it would use.

It is important to present separate targets for each of these elements, or at least to clearly identify their contribution to the NDC target. This helps to increase transparency and assess the credibility of the NDC target, as each of these negative emissions options come with their own set of advantages and limitations.

The lack of clarity on the contribution of each negative emissions technology makes it harder for the CAT to assess the UAE’s NDC target excluding LULUCF. To estimate the contribution of LULUCF to the UAE’s 2035 target, the CAT assumes agriculture emissions from 2021 (last reported year in the national GHG inventory) remain constant until 2035 (which is supported by the sectoral pathway presented int the UAE’s LTS which show all emissions reductions in the agriculture sector until 2035 will come from decarbonisation and reduction of its energy use) and then subtracts this value from the AFOLU estimate provided in the NDC. The estimated LULUCF emissions in 2035 using this method is -7.6 MtCO2e.

The UAE claims that the “target has been established in line with a 1.5 pathway in an effort to showcase the UAE’s best efforts” but does not explain how such a pathway was derived, which would require breaking the global goal of 1.5°C to the country level of the UAE.

UAE’s climate targets and policies

Guide to a good 2035 climate target


# Policies & action

**The** **CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.**

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies are set, in a best case scenario, to plateau close to 2022 levels, at around 214 MtCO2e, or continue to increase to about 259 MtCO2e. Under current policies, the UAE is set to miss its latest 2030 emissions reduction target. To meet its 2030 NDC target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions by a further 15–40%. However, if the UAE implements the planned policies outlined in both its NDC and LTS, it could potentially reach its target. For more information, please see the Assumptions tab.

Since 2023, the UAE has published information on many relevant climate policies across all sectors of the economy. Both its NDC from 2023 and its LTS from early 2024 provide details on policies and action, both current and planned, in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

This is a significant step in transparency, which allows for a better understanding of how the UAE plans to reduce its emissions to meet its NDC and net zero targets. However, it also shows a critical overreliance on carbon capture and storage both in the power and industry sectors, a smokescreen allowing the country to continue expanding its oil and fossil gas production and use while claiming to be on the way to net zero.

In recent years, the UAE has announced plans to invest in renewables both at home and abroad, including a USD 100bn commitment together with the United States (Associated Press, 2023). However, in parallel it continues to invest into fossil fuel production. The UAE is planning to significantly increase its oil production in the next years, and is pushing to reach “gas self-sufficiency”, with major investments in offshore gas production. In November 2022, ADNOC announced a USD 150bn investment plan to expand its oil and gas business in the next five years (The Guardian, 2023). As part of this plan, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17bn in October 2023 for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). For more details, see the Power sector section below.

The developments and the investment going towards new fossil fuel infrastructure are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, instead are likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition towards renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and switch to renewables, which would reduce prices and price volatility for consumers, and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).


## Power sector

The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce electricity emissions by 11% below 2019 levels by 2030. Under this sectoral target, emissions from electricity are expected to be ~68 MtCO2e in 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its LTS, the UAE includes additional information on its power sector plan, including a demand forecast of 211 TWh by 2030 and a grid coefficient of 0.27 tCO2e/MWh, a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline level of 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.

According to the UAE’s latest version of its Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS, the 2030 target will be mostly achieved by expanding renewables and nuclear. However, the achievement of the 2050 target of a zero-emissions grid coefficient is expected to rely heavily on the use of CCS on gas power plants, instead of a plan to phase out fossil fuels from power generation.

CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels and increases emissions, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants.

The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54 billion over the next seven years to support its updated energy targets. However, it remains unclear if the recently announced investment plan is additional to the USD 160 billion the country had previously announced to support its 2050 energy targets (Associated Press, 2023).

In May 2020, the construction of the first phase of the UAE and the Middle-East’s first coal power plant was completed. This consisted of the first two units of the 2.4 GW ultra-supercritical Hassyan power plant, with the second phase planned for Q3 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

In February 2022, the UAE announced that it would be switching its coal power plant to fossil gas, in support of its net zero target, and has reported that the plant, originally designed as a dual-fuel plant, has now done so (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

The UAE’s revised Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS all confirm that the country is not planning to include any coal power in its electricity mix.

The UAE continues to develop nuclear power. In October 2022, the third unit of the Barakah nuclear power plant went online, increasing total capacity to 4.2 GW. The last unit of the project, awarded to a South Korean consortium, came online in February 2023. Once the last unit is operational in 2025, the plant will increase its installed capacity to 5.6 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

According to a Reuters report from April 2024, the UAE is planning to tender a new nuclear power plant between this and next year, potentially including four reactors similarly to the existing Barakah power plant (Power Technology, 2024).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.

As part of its energy strategy, the UAE is planning to expand its renewables capacity, mostly through solar power. The UAE plans to reach 19.8 GW of renewables installed capacity in 2030, with an expected 33 TWh of generation, up from 6GW installed capacity in 2023 (IRENA, 2023).

It also set out a target to produce at least 30% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. This falls significantly short of the CAT 1.5°C compatible benchmark for the UAE, which sets renewable power generation at 66% of the total by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b; Government of the UAE, 2023b).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation

As part of its LTS, the UAE plans to roll out additional policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. These include CO2 emissions targets or caps for power producers through regulators at the emirate level, incentives for distributed power generation such as net metering, installing PV solar in public buildings, and tariff revisions to facilitate load balancing (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE also continues to invest in large scale solar power and storage. With its current and planned renewable energy developments, the UAE is expected to reach 9 GW of renewable power by 2030. Following the construction of the ~1.2 GW Noor Abu Dhabi solar PV plant in 2019, the UAE has continued to develop utility scale PV plants. The Al Dhafra Solar PV plant, added another 2 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Tollast, 2022). In May 2022, a third solar PV project entered the tendering process. Once completed, the Al Ajban Solar PV will add 1.5 GW of capacity (Technical Review Middle East, 2022).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE has also committed to invest around USD 160bn over the next three decades in “clean” and renewable energy, which might include nuclear and fossil gas. As part of this plan, the UAE has signed a preliminary agreement with Engie Solutions (subsidiary of Engie) to develop further clean energy projects (Benny, 2022).

In November 2022, the UAE signed the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) with the US, committing to mobilise USD 100bn to support the development of 100 GW of renewables both domestically and abroad by 2035. However, it is not yet clear which technologies will be supported under the “clean energy” concept, and how this new commitment will interact with existing finance plans in the UAE, that means, whether the planned investments will be additional to previous ones. In July 2023, the UAE announced it will be investing USD 54 billion to achieve its new 2030 clean energy target. Same as for the PACE announcement, it remains unclear whether this commitment is additional to existing ones (Associated Press, 2023).

In addition to these solar power projects, a contract for the UAE’s first pumped storage hydroelectric plant, with an expected capacity of 250 MW, was awarded in August 2019, and scheduled for commission in 2024 (Power Technology, 2022). Abu Dhabi’s virtual battery plant, currently with 108 MW of capacity, will also be expanded with an additional 300 MW in 2026.


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for ~19% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce transport emissions by 1% below 2019 levels by 2030. Emissions from the transport sector are expected to be ~42 MtCO2e in 2030 under this target, and to reach zero emissions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

The UAE has set out some policies to manage transport emissions, including an increase in the fuel and emissions efficiency of its vehicle fleet, as well incentives for the use of public transport, and the uptake of EVs. The revised Energy Strategy 2050 includes new targets for the uptake of EVs, including reaching 691,100 EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and over three million by 2050 as well as increasing the number of EV chargers to 879 by 2030 and 30k by 2050. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have also set out a series of urban transport policies, aimed among others at incentivising the uptake of public transport and EVs (Government of the UAE, 2021). For example, in May 2022 the Abu Dhabi government set out a new EV charging station policy, defining standards and requirements in anticipation of growing demand for EVs. In Dubai, the Green Mobility Strategy 2030 includes a target to reach 30% EVs and hybrids in the government vehicle fleet by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

In its LTS, the UAE lists additional policies it proposes to reach its target for the transport sector towards 2050. The key pillars of the UAE’s transport decarbonisation plan are to reduce transportation needs, decarbonise passenger transport, freight transport, and mechanical vehicles (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The first pillar will include the development of mixed-use buildings, improved infrastructure for cycling and walking, incentives for carpooling and increased use of public transport and rail. In total this will contribute 14% of the reductions needed to achieve the UAE’s target. The second pillar includes incentives for the uptake of EVs, the electrification of buses, taxis and motorcycles. In total this will contribute 22% of the emission reductions needed.

The decarbonisation of freight transport includes a shift towards more rail use as well as the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. These measures are expected to contribute 27% of the reductions needed. Finally, the electrification of mechanical vehicles is expected to contribute 28% of the reductions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

Additionally, the UAE has set out plans to decarbonise its domestic maritime and aviation sectors, including electrification and use of sustainable fuels.


## Industry

The industry sector, including oil and gas production, is the largest source of emissions in the UAE, accounting for 46% of the country’s total emissions, or 103 MtCO2e. This includes emissions from industrial processes as well as indirect emissions from power and heat generation (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The UAE’s LTS includes a target to reduce industry emissions by 5% below 2019 levels by 2030, and 93% by 2050, while its current policy projections estimate these emissions will rise by 18% above 2019 levels by 2030.

The UAE has a series of policies to reduce emissions from its industry sector, mostly focusing on increasing efficiency through adoption of best practices. To reach its target, the UAE plans to adopt a series of policies such as a cap and trade system, contracts for difference, regulated transport and storage for CCS, updated blended cement regulations, updated building codes, hydrogen production incentives and others (Government of the UAE, 2024b). On April 2024, the UAE also ratified the Kigali amendment, committing to reducing HFCs consumption by 87% by 2047 compared to its average consumption in 2024-2026 (IIR, 2024).

The UAE plans to reduce its industry emissions through different means. Around 20% of the reductions towards its net zero target will come from fuel substitution and process switches in key industries such as steel and cement (Government of the UAE, 2024b). For example, the UAE’s LTS mentions the switch to concentrated solar power for heat for industrial processes and switching from blast furnaces to hydrogen-powered direct reduced iron processes for steel.

However, a large share of the emissions reductions (32%) is expected to come directly from the deployment of CCS and from the decarbonisation of the power sector which will also heavily rely on CCS. Such overreliance on a technology that has not yet been proven at scale can seriously hinder the UAE’s progress towards transitioning its industry sector and can serve as a smokescreen to continue expanding fossil fuel production (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE is the world’s seventh largest oil producer and 14th largest gas producer (US EIA, 2023a). It is also one of the world’s largest oil exporters. The UAE’s exported emissions from oil and gas are about 2.5 times larger than its domestic emissions (see graph below) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023c).

In 2022, oil production reached 4.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (US EIA, 2023b). Following an OPEC+ decision in October 2022 (Deepthi Nair, 2022), to cut production by twomillion barrels per day (mbpd) in an effort to keep oil prices up the UAE announced it would cut over 140,000 barrels per day from May 2023 until the end of the year (Gulf Today, 2023). However, the government also recently announced it was bringing forward its oil production capacity of five mbpd target (up from 3.8 mbpd currently), from 2030 to 2025, signalling its intent to ramp up production in the short term (Di Paola, 2022).

The UAE is also developing oil and gas offshore exploration and production. This is part of its efforts to reach “gas self-sufficiency” (ICLG, 2022). In February 2022, the first offshore fields were discovered, which are estimated to contain between 43 and 57 billion cubic metres of gas (AFP, 2022).

During 2022, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Drilling was awarded almost USD 6bn in contracts to “maximise value from Abu Dhabi’s offshore oil and gas resources” (World-Energy, 2022). In October 2023, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17 bn for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). This is part of a USD 150bn ADNOC plan to increase production of oil and gas.

According to the IEA, the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure beyond what was already committed in 2021 is incompatible with reaching net zero by 2050 (IEA, 2021). The UAE’s plans to further develop and invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These plans are also likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition to renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).

In October 2023, ADNOC announced plans to double its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation plan (Energy Voice, 2023). In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

During COP26, the UAE unveiled its “Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap”, a strategy aimed at developing the domestic production of green and blue hydrogen aimed at export markets in Asia and Europe. The roadmap already includes seven projects which are either completed or underway (including blue ammonia production). The overarching target of the strategy is to reach a 25% market share in key markets such as India, Japan, Germany and others (H2 World News, 2021).

According to the UAE’s 2023 NDC update, several projects are already under way to support the country’s hydrogen ambitions, and a new Hydrogen Strategy is being prepared (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its updated Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE also includes a target to produce 1.4 Mt of hydrogen annually by 2031. The UAE’s LTS includes additional information on its hydrogen development plans, including production targets of 7.3 Mt by 2040 and 14.9 Mt by 2050. Around half of the hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels with CCS (blue hydrogen), with the majority of the second half being green hydrogen and a small share coming from nuclear power (pink hydrogen) (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Buildings

The buildings sector accounted for ~28% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce building emissions by 56% below 2019 levels by 2030, while its LTS targets a 98% reduction below 2019 levels by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). Emissions from the building sector are expected to be 27 MtCO2e in 2030 under the NDC from 2023, while under current policies they are expected to be 35 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE set out a target of reducing energy consumption by 40%. Several policies are in place to support this target in the buildings sector, including the National Water and Energy Demand Side Management Programme and a federal government building retrofit programme, aiming at 2000 retrofits by 2050. Some Emirates have also produced their own plans and policies to reduce energy consumption from the buildings sector, including Dubai’s plan to retrofit 30,000 buildings by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

The majority of the emissions reductions in the building sector towards the UAE’s NDC target are expected to come from energy efficiency measures including more efficient heating and cooling, as well as demand side management initiatives. The emissions reductions necessary to reach the LTS target of 1 MtCO2e in 2050 will come almost entirely from reducing power and heat emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Waste

According to the UAE’s latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the waste sector accounted for 6% of the country’s emissions in 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE’s LTS sets a target for waste emissions, which are set to increase by 8% above 2019 levels by 2030 and should decrease by 75% below 2019 levels in 2050. Emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach 14 MtCO2e in 2030, up from 13 MtCO2e in 2019 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). This includes emissions from landfills as well as emissions stemming from energy used to transport and treat waste.

In January 2021, the UAE launched its Circular Economy Policy 2031, establishing a Circular Economy Council, tasked with supervising the implementation of waste reduction policies that also target the manufacturing sector. In May 2022, the Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant was launched, with a capacity of 30 MW. A further 200 MW plant is planned in Dubai and a 70 MW plant in Abu Dhabi, both expected to be operational in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Sharma, 2022).

However, the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy has no concrete waste or emissions reduction targets. We were not able to check whether its previous target of diverting 75% of its waste from landfills by 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2019) has been achieved. The UAE’s LTS includes a target of diverting 80% of its waste by 2031 and 90% by 2035. It also plans to capture the remaining methane produced in its landfills and retrofitting its waste-to-energy plants with CCS.

Under its net zero scenario, the UAE expects waste to contribute around 3 MtCO2e by 2050.


## Methane

The UAE signed the methane pledge at COP26, in which signatories agreed to cut methane emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. According to the UAE’s latest inventory, methane represented ~7% of total GHG emissions in 2021, mostly stemming from upstream fossil fuel production and waste (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE already includes methane in its NDC and has some policies in place designed to reduce both energy and waste-related methane emissions.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2021 are taken from the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). For the years between 1994 and 2021 emissions are estimated by interpolating values between reported values. For the period 1990-1994 and 2021-2022 we estimate values by using growth rates from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024).

The UAE now includes an F-gases estimate in its latest national inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly related to data availability. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

The historical data used in our previous assessment estimated emissions to be around 15% higher in 2022 compared to our current assessment. The data from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024) was based on the UAE’s latest inventory published in 2016, and used different methods to fill the gaps in the inventory and extend the estimates until 2022. The new GHG inventory published by the UAE in 2024 presents a significant upgrade in terms of data quality. The difference in economy-wide emissions estimates is mostly explained by a decrease in industrial process emissions, which are roughly half in the UAE’s own inventory compared to PRIMAP in 2022, and to differences in fugitive emissions data for 2021. According to PRIMAP’s estimates, the emissions they calculated for the UAE in 2022 based on their old inventory are 98% higher than the ones calculated based on the UAE’s new inventory for 2022. The UAE’s old inventory published in 2015 (Ministry of Energy, 2015) includes estimates for 1994 and 2014, while the new inventory published in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2024a) includes an estimate only for 2021.


## NDC

The absolute emissions level for the NDC target incl. LULUCF is taken directly from the NDC document.

**F-gases**

Because F-gases are excluded from the UAE’s 2030 NDC target, the CAT adds them into the quantification of the NDC by assuming that F-gases remain constant from the last historical year (2021) until the target year (2030). The F-gases estimate comes from the UAE’s latest inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly due to data limitations. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

**LULUCF**

The target in the UAE’s 2023 NDC includes LULUCF emissions. To estimate the emissions level resulting from the target excluding LULUCF, we take the value for its 2030 LULUCF target (included in the NDC) and subtract it from the main NDC target.

**Global Warming Potential (GWP) values**

The UAE’s 2023 NDC specifies that it currently uses AR4 both for the BAU scenario and the NDC and sectoral targets. For the 2020 NDC, which was presented in SAR, we converted the 2030 BAU value from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor from the last available nationally reported historical data point (2021).


## Current policy projections

**Lower bound**

The UAE’s LTS includes current policy projections which are used as a baseline for the net zero scenario (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The current policy projections include all mitigation measures in force up to 2024 in all sectors of the economy, while the net zero scenario includes planned measures and their estimated contribution towards the target. The CAT uses the UAE’s LTS current policy scenario for the lower bound of its own current policy projections.

The CAT harmonizes the UAE’s LTS current policy scenarios to the latest available historical GHG emissions data (from 2022) using the growth rates of the original scenario for the period 2022-2035. The UAE only provided data for its current policies for the years 2019, 2030, 2040 and 2050. To create a pathway, the CAT linearly interpolates the values between these years.

Because the original projections include emissions and sinks from LULUCF, the CAT assumes that LULUCF emissions remain at 2019 levels (latest historical data available) under current policies. The UAE’s 2019 LULUCF emissions are -1 MtCO2e.

**Upper bound**

For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy.

The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures. For this projection, we estimate total power generation by technology using capacity factors estimated based on the IRENA REMAP BAU scenario (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015).

In summary, the CPP upper end of the range for the UAE’s energy-related CO2 emissions is based on assumptions both about which targets will be implemented, as well as the role of fossil gas in the development of the power system.

For CO2 process emissions (from industry), we continue a linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030 (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015). For non-CO2 emissions, we apply the growth rate from the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 to PRIMAP historical data (US EPA, 2019).

We use the following data sources in our estimates:

- Energy-related CO2 from fuel combustion: “Renewable Energy Prospects – United Arab Emirates” (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015)
- CO2 process emissions (from industry): Own assumption to continue linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030.
- Non-CO2 emissions: Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 (US EPA, 2019)
- Historical installed capacity data: IRENA capacity and generation statistics 2023 (IRENASTAT, 2023)
- Historical electricity generation data: IEA World Energy Balances 2022 (IEA, 2022)
- Historical emissions factors: IEA Emissions Factors 2021 (IEA, 2021a).

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UAE’s net zero strategy covers all GHG emissions except F-gases and assumes a 3.5 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target and so that is the value taken for their net zero target excluding LULUCF.

Due to the uncertainty in estimating F-gases emissions in the UAE by 2050, the CAT does not include any estimation when calculating the UAE’s 2050 emissions excluding LULUCF. This can change in future updates once new emissions data for historical years and future projections are available.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

The UAE submitted an updated NDC for 2030 in July 2023 after having already strengthened its NDC target in 2022. With the UAE’s emissions still set to increase by 2030, we estimate it will not be able to meet this updated NDC target, nor the former one.

The NDC from 2023 has an unconditional and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 182 MtCO2e (including emissions from land use and forestry, or LULUCF) by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). The CAT rates this target, excluding LULUCF, as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

In October 2021 the UAE announced its intention to reach net zero emissions as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s net zero target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero.


## NDC updates

The UAE submitted a 2035 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 06 November 2024. The CAT’s analysis of the UAE’s 2035 NDC target can be found here.

The UAE submitted a stronger 2030 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 11 July 2023. While the UAE needs to put forward substantially improved climate policies to reach the NDC, it is an improvement on the former NDC in the following ways:

- It includes strengthened emissions reduction target—to limit emissions to 182 MtCO2e by 2030 (including LULUCF), down from 208 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a).
- The target is now expressed as an absolute emissions limit. The previous target was a reduction below a business as usual (BAU) scenario.
- The NDC provides sectoral targets for the electricity and water generation, industry, transport, buildings, waste and agriculture sub-sectors.
- It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency.
We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The CAT’s calculation of the UAE’s 2030 NDC target also includes PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and HFCs which are not covered by the target. For this calculation, the CAT assumes that F-gases remain constant from the last available historical data point (2021). In its latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the UAE reported its latest GHG inventory covering the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2021. The F-gases value for 2021 is 0.15 MtCO2e in AR4 (Government of the UAE, 2024a).

This new target represents a targeted decrease in emissions of 14% below 2022 levels (excl. LULUCF).

The NDC mentions many of the policies and strategies that underpin the 2030 target. This includes the UAE’s National Energy Strategy 2050, which aims for 44% of renewable and 6% of nuclear energy in installed electric capacity by 2050, while reducing final electricity demand by 42–45% (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

This strategy was recently updated to remove its previous target of 12% of coal capacity by 2050, which is now replaced by an increased fossil gas capacity from 38% to 50%. This updated strategy continues to be inconsistent with the need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050, due to the continued long-term reliance on fossil gas (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

The UAE reserves the option to use carbon credits for emission reductions abroad under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own domestic emissions to achieve its NDC target (Government of the UAE, 2023a). Although it has not yet announced any firm details of how it will secure carbon credits towards its climate targets (either the NDC or net zero), a privately owned Emirati company called Blue Carbon has recently made headlines for its carbon credit deals. Since its inception in 2022, the company has signed MOU's with the governments of Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to acquire conservation rights for around 60 million acres of their forests, to generate carbon credits from projects avoiding deforestation, and sell them on the market (Pearce, 2023).

Details on how the government of the UAE intends to purchase credits from Blue Carbon or other similar providers to support claims to offset its own emissions are unclear. This ambiguity presents major risks that the UAE will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. The use of credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should complement and not serve to distract from or displace critically needed mitigation efforts domestically.

The UAE’s 2030 NDC submitted in 2023 shows an increase in ambition and has improved its transparency by sharing sectoral targets and more details on the measures planned to achieve them. However, the UAE’s current plans for its oil and gas industry and its power sector continue to be incompatible with its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and "Insufficient" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways.

CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update.

For more details, please see the Assumptions section.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023).

We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.


# Summary


## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

The UAE has not updated its 2030 NDC to match the new 2035 NDC, which implies going from a 7% reduction in 2030 to a 44% reduction in 2035, below 2019 levels.

The UAE is not on track to meet its 2030 target under our current policy projections, needing an emissions reduction of 22% to meet its 2030 target. To meet its 2035 target, the UAE would need to reduce its emissions a further 31% – a total of 53% from its projected 2030 emission levels under current policies. Without details as to how these cuts would be made, the 2035 target is hard to view as credible.

These credibility concerns are exacerbated when assessing the UAE NDC’s sectoral breakdown. This shows that most emissions reductions are expected to come from the buildings, industry and transport sectors, but the power sector will remain largely fossil fuel based, with an unrealistic reliance on CCS instead of renewables. There is no improvement on the renewables target.

The new NDC clarifies the overall contribution of negative emissions but does not clarify what proportion is technological based CDR versus what proportion is nature-based.

On 6 November 2024, the UAE submitted its 2035 NDC, setting an absolute target of reducing emissions to 103.5 MtCO2e, which represents a 47% reduction below 2019 levels. This target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from its assessment, resulting in a target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035.

The UAE's 2035 target itself is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway but new NDC did not increase the ambition of its 2030 emission reduction target, which is well above our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. The failure to substantially increase the ambition of the UAE’s 2030 targets raises serious concerns as to the credibility of its 2035 NDC given that a further 41%-point reduction (jumping from 7% to 48% below 2019 levels) would be needed in national emissions in only five years between 2030 and 2035. The serious lack of alignment between its 2030 and 2035 NDC means the country cannot claim to be on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap.

The UAE’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UAE’s 2035 target does represent a significant step forward in ambition compared to its 2030 target, leading to emissions dropping by 40% between 2030 and 2035.

The UAE’s 2035 target leads to 44% lower emissions in 2035 compared to 2019 across all sectors excluding LULUCF. However, the UAE has not increased its 2030 target, which represents only a 7% decrease in emissions below 2019. So, the vast majority of the emissions reductions by 2035 are expected to happen in the five years between 2030 and 2035. The steep rate of emission reductions assumed between 2030 and 2035 make this 2035 target not credible if it is to be achieved domestically.

The target of 111 MtCO2e in 2035 is below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway of 121.4 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. However, the 2030 target is well above that path. Hence the NDC trajectory is not compatible with global least cost 1.5 pathways.

The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste sectors. It outlines measures and plans to achieve emissions reductions in each sector against a 2019 baseline and is largely in line with what the UAE presented in its previous NDC as well as its LTS. However, the NDC does not present any new sectoral targets for 2035 beyond its emission reduction targets (e.g. no new renewable energy capacity targets).

Further information on the UAE’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

The UAE has communicated that it intends to provide and mobilise:

- USD 2 billion in grants and concessional loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries
- USD 1.2 billion for climate action alongside the Declaration on Climate, Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRR)
- USD 200 million to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust
- USD 100 million to the Loss & Damage Fund
- USD 30 billion to the Alterra fund for industrial decarbonization, climate technologies, sustainable living, and the energy transition
- USD 100 billion together with the US for its Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) which support renewable energy both at home and abroad
The UAE’s NDC showcases many of its contributions towards climate finance but does not present a clear overview of how much it plans to spend per year, how it will be distributed by sector/activities, and which regions will be targeted.


## Credibility

The UAE’s 2035 NDC target is supported by sectoral targets and measures that provide a degree of credibility to it. However, given that most emission reductions are expected to happen between 2030 and 2035, it raises the question whether the 9% annual change rate in emissions implied in the NDC target pathway is realistic.

The UAE will need to implement new policies to reach its 2035 target. Emissions under current policies are expected to be 48-57% or 102-148 MtCO2e above the NDC target in 2035. With the planned measures outlined in its LTS, it is possible that the UAE could come close to its 2035 NDC target, but open questions remain about the UAE’s measures to decarbonize its power and industry sectors, and the expected role of CCS.

The UAE is one of the world’s leading fossil fuel producers and exporters. While under its new NDC it plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels domestically, current plans by its state oil company (ADNOC) make it clear that the UAE plans to continue expanding its oil and gas activities.


## Transparency

The UAE’s NDC includes an absolute emissions target, which covers all gases and sectors of the economy. It also breaks down the target to the sectoral level to show the decarbonisation contribution expected of each sector. In its LTS, the UAE presents an emissions pathway which includes both its 2030 NDC target and its 2050 net zero target. However, a new version of this pathway was not included in the latest NDC to include the 2035 target.

The UAE includes an estimate of negative emissions in 2035, which includes both LULUCF and technological CDR such as direct air capture. Negative emissions are expected to reach 9.3 MtCO2e in 2035. In its previous NDC and its LTS, the UAE did clarify the contribution of each type of negative emissions. However, it does not clarify the contribution of each type to the total in its 2035 NDC target. Finally, the UAE reserves the use of carbon credits under article 6 of the Paris agreement, but does not commit to using credits, nor provides an estimate of how many it would use.

It is important to present separate targets for each of these elements, or at least to clearly identify their contribution to the NDC target. This helps to increase transparency and assess the credibility of the NDC target, as each of these negative emissions options come with their own set of advantages and limitations.

The lack of clarity on the contribution of each negative emissions technology makes it harder for the CAT to assess the UAE’s NDC target excluding LULUCF. To estimate the contribution of LULUCF to the UAE’s 2035 target, the CAT assumes agriculture emissions from 2021 (last reported year in the national GHG inventory) remain constant until 2035 (which is supported by the sectoral pathway presented int the UAE’s LTS which show all emissions reductions in the agriculture sector until 2035 will come from decarbonisation and reduction of its energy use) and then subtracts this value from the AFOLU estimate provided in the NDC. The estimated LULUCF emissions in 2035 using this method is -7.6 MtCO2e.

The UAE claims that the “target has been established in line with a 1.5 pathway in an effort to showcase the UAE’s best efforts” but does not explain how such a pathway was derived, which would require breaking the global goal of 1.5°C to the country level of the UAE.

UAE’s climate targets and policies

Guide to a good 2035 climate target


# Policies & action

**The** **CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.**

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies are set, in a best case scenario, to plateau close to 2022 levels, at around 214 MtCO2e, or continue to increase to about 259 MtCO2e. Under current policies, the UAE is set to miss its latest 2030 emissions reduction target. To meet its 2030 NDC target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions by a further 15–40%. However, if the UAE implements the planned policies outlined in both its NDC and LTS, it could potentially reach its target. For more information, please see the Assumptions tab.

Since 2023, the UAE has published information on many relevant climate policies across all sectors of the economy. Both its NDC from 2023 and its LTS from early 2024 provide details on policies and action, both current and planned, in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

This is a significant step in transparency, which allows for a better understanding of how the UAE plans to reduce its emissions to meet its NDC and net zero targets. However, it also shows a critical overreliance on carbon capture and storage both in the power and industry sectors, a smokescreen allowing the country to continue expanding its oil and fossil gas production and use while claiming to be on the way to net zero.

In recent years, the UAE has announced plans to invest in renewables both at home and abroad, including a USD 100bn commitment together with the United States (Associated Press, 2023). However, in parallel it continues to invest into fossil fuel production. The UAE is planning to significantly increase its oil production in the next years, and is pushing to reach “gas self-sufficiency”, with major investments in offshore gas production. In November 2022, ADNOC announced a USD 150bn investment plan to expand its oil and gas business in the next five years (The Guardian, 2023). As part of this plan, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17bn in October 2023 for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). For more details, see the Power sector section below.

The developments and the investment going towards new fossil fuel infrastructure are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, instead are likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition towards renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and switch to renewables, which would reduce prices and price volatility for consumers, and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).


## Power sector

The UAE’s power sector remains heavily reliant on fossil gas, which accounted for 72% of total electricity generation in 2023. This is followed by nuclear energy (20%) and renewables (8%) (Ember, 2025).

The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce electricity emissions by 11% below 2019 levels by 2030. Under this sectoral target, emissions from electricity are expected to be ~68 MtCO2e in 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its LTS, the UAE includes additional information on its power sector plan, including a demand forecast of 211 TWh by 2030 and a grid coefficient of 0.27 tCO2e/MWh, a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline level of 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.

According to the UAE’s latest version of its Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS, the 2030 target will be mostly achieved by expanding renewables and nuclear. However, the achievement of the 2050 target of a zero-emissions grid coefficient is expected to rely heavily on the use of CCS on gas power plants, instead of a plan to phase out fossil fuels from power generation.

CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally. Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels and increases emissions, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS does not remove 100% of emissions from power plants.

The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54 billion over the next seven years to support its updated energy targets. However, it remains unclear if the recently announced investment plan is additional to the USD 160 billion the country had previously announced to support its 2050 energy targets (Associated Press, 2023).

The UAE has taken steps to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, mainly through large-scale investments into wind and solar. The share of electricity generated from renewables has increased in the past five years, going from 3% in 2019 to 8% in 2023 (Ember, 2025). While these efforts mark progress, the current pace of deployment remains slow and the related targets insufficient. As a result, we evaluate the UAE’s overall efforts to deploy renewable energy as **“Slow Progress”.**

As part of its energy strategy, the UAE is planning to expand its renewables capacity, mostly through solar power. The UAE plans to reach 19.8 GW of renewables installed capacity in 2030, with an expected 33 TWh of generation, up from 6 GW of total installed capacity in 2023 (Ember, 2025).

It also set out a target to produce at least 30% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. This falls significantly short of the CAT 1.5°C compatible benchmark for the UAE, which sets renewable power generation at 66% of the total by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b; Government of the UAE, 2023b).

As part of its LTS, the UAE plans to roll out additional policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. These include CO2 emissions targets or caps for power producers through regulators at the emirate level, incentives for distributed power generation such as net metering, installing PV solar in public buildings, and tariff revisions to facilitate load balancing (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE also continues to invest in large scale solar power and storage. With its current and planned renewable energy developments, the UAE is expected to reach 9 GW of renewable power by 2030. Following the construction of the ~1.2 GW Noor Abu Dhabi solar PV plant in 2019, the UAE has continued to develop utility scale PV plants. The Al Dhafra Solar PV plant, added another 2 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Tollast, 2022). In May 2022, a third solar PV project entered the tendering process. Once completed, the Al Ajban Solar PV will add 1.5 GW of capacity (Technical Review Middle East, 2022).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE has also committed to invest around USD 160bn over the next three decades in “clean” and renewable energy, which might include nuclear and fossil gas. As part of this plan, the UAE has signed a preliminary agreement with Engie Solutions (subsidiary of Engie) to develop further clean energy projects (Benny, 2022).

In November 2022, the UAE signed the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) with the US, committing to mobilise USD 100bn to support the development of 100 GW of renewables both domestically and abroad by 2035. However, it is not yet clear which technologies will be supported under the “clean energy” concept, and how this new commitment will interact with existing finance plans in the UAE, that means, whether the planned investments will be additional to previous ones. In July 2023, the UAE announced it will be investing USD 54 billion to achieve its new 2030 clean energy target. Same as for the PACE announcement, it remains unclear whether this commitment is additional to existing ones (Associated Press, 2023).

In addition to these solar power projects, a contract for the UAE’s first pumped storage hydroelectric plant, with an expected capacity of 250 MW, was awarded in August 2019, and scheduled for commission in 2024 (Power Technology, 2022). Abu Dhabi’s virtual battery plant, currently with 108 MW of capacity, will also be expanded with an additional 300 MW in 2026.

The UAE is sending **“Mixed signals**” on fossil gas. Since 2018, the share of gas in the power mix has steadily declined from 99% to 72% in 2023 (Ember, 2025). In absolute terms, gas-fired electricity generation has also decreased, falling from 135 TWh in 2018 to 119 TWh in 2023. However, fossil gas still dominates the power mix, and there are no plans to phase it out. The UAE added 2.1 GW of fossil gas power generation capacity in 2023, with around 9 GW of additional projects currently in the pipeline(Ember, 2025; Global Energy Monitor, 2025).

The UAE continues to invest in new gas infrastructure and has plans to further exploit domestic gas resources (see industry section below). The UAE’s continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is inconsistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These developments risk locking the country into a high-emissions future and undermining the clean energy transition. Instead of ramping up fossil gas production, the UAE should adopt an ambitious plan to phase out its reliance on gas for electricity, avoiding stranded assets and aligning with global climate goals (CAT, 2022).

The UAE has recently unveiled plans to deploy carbon capture, and sequestration (CCS) technologies to capture CO2 emissions in its gas power plants. In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

The UAE’s power sector is **“Coal Free”.** In May 2020, the construction of the first phase of the UAE and the Middle-East’s first coal power plant was completed. This consisted of the first two units of the 2.4 GW ultra-supercritical Hassyan power plant, with the second phase planned for Q3 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

In February 2022, the UAE announced that it would be switching its coal power plant to fossil gas, in support of its net zero target, and has reported that the plant, originally designed as a dual-fuel plant, has now done so (Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

The UAE’s revised Energy Strategy 2050, as well as its NDC and LTS all confirm that the country is not planning to include any coal power in its electricity mix.

The UAE continues to develop nuclear power. The share of nuclear power in the country’s electricity mix increasing significantly, rising from around 1% in 2020 to 20% in 2023 (ember).

In October 2022, the third unit of the Barakah nuclear power plant went online, increasing total capacity to 4.2 GW. The last unit of the project, awarded to a South Korean consortium, came online in February 2023. Once the last unit is operational in 2025, the plant will increase its installed capacity to 5.6 GW (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

According to a Reuters report from April 2024, the UAE is planning to tender a new nuclear power plant between this and next year, potentially including four reactors similarly to the existing Barakah power plant (Power Technology, 2024).

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for ~19% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce transport emissions by 1% below 2019 levels by 2030. Emissions from the transport sector are expected to be ~42 MtCO2e in 2030 under this target, and to reach zero emissions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2023a).

The UAE has set out some policies to manage transport emissions, including an increase in the fuel and emissions efficiency of its vehicle fleet, as well incentives for the use of public transport, and the uptake of EVs. The revised Energy Strategy 2050 includes new targets for the uptake of EVs, including reaching 691,100 EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and over three million by 2050 as well as increasing the number of EV chargers to 879 by 2030 and 30k by 2050. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have also set out a series of urban transport policies, aimed among others at incentivising the uptake of public transport and EVs (Government of the UAE, 2021). For example, in May 2022 the Abu Dhabi government set out a new EV charging station policy, defining standards and requirements in anticipation of growing demand for EVs. In Dubai, the Green Mobility Strategy 2030 includes a target to reach 30% EVs and hybrids in the government vehicle fleet by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

In its LTS, the UAE lists additional policies it proposes to reach its target for the transport sector towards 2050. The key pillars of the UAE’s transport decarbonisation plan are to reduce transportation needs, decarbonise passenger transport, freight transport, and mechanical vehicles (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The first pillar will include the development of mixed-use buildings, improved infrastructure for cycling and walking, incentives for carpooling and increased use of public transport and rail. In total this will contribute 14% of the reductions needed to achieve the UAE’s target. The second pillar includes incentives for the uptake of EVs, the electrification of buses, taxis and motorcycles. In total this will contribute 22% of the emission reductions needed.

The decarbonisation of freight transport includes a shift towards more rail use as well as the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. These measures are expected to contribute 27% of the reductions needed. Finally, the electrification of mechanical vehicles is expected to contribute 28% of the reductions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

Additionally, the UAE has set out plans to decarbonise its domestic maritime and aviation sectors, including electrification and use of sustainable fuels.


## Industry

The industry sector, including oil and gas production, is the largest source of emissions in the UAE, accounting for 46% of the country’s total emissions, or 103 MtCO2e. This includes emissions from industrial processes as well as indirect emissions from power and heat generation (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The UAE’s LTS includes a target to reduce industry emissions by 5% below 2019 levels by 2030, and 93% by 2050, while its current policy projections estimate these emissions will rise by 18% above 2019 levels by 2030.

The UAE has a series of policies to reduce emissions from its industry sector, mostly focusing on increasing efficiency through adoption of best practices. To reach its target, the UAE plans to adopt a series of policies such as a cap and trade system, contracts for difference, regulated transport and storage for CCS, updated blended cement regulations, updated building codes, hydrogen production incentives and others (Government of the UAE, 2024b). On April 2024, the UAE also ratified the Kigali amendment, committing to reducing HFCs consumption by 87% by 2047 compared to its average consumption in 2024-2026 (IIR, 2024).

The UAE plans to reduce its industry emissions through different means. Around 20% of the reductions towards its net zero target will come from fuel substitution and process switches in key industries such as steel and cement (Government of the UAE, 2024b). For example, the UAE’s LTS mentions the switch to concentrated solar power for heat for industrial processes and switching from blast furnaces to hydrogen-powered direct reduced iron processes for steel.

However, a large share of the emissions reductions (32%) is expected to come directly from the deployment of CCS and from the decarbonisation of the power sector which will also heavily rely on CCS. Such overreliance on a technology that has not yet been proven at scale can seriously hinder the UAE’s progress towards transitioning its industry sector and can serve as a smokescreen to continue expanding fossil fuel production (Government of the UAE, 2024b).

The UAE is the world’s seventh largest oil producer and 14th largest gas producer (US EIA, 2023a). It is also one of the world’s largest oil exporters. The UAE’s exported emissions from oil and gas are about 2.5 times larger than its domestic emissions (see graph below) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023c).

In 2022, oil production reached 4.2 million barrels per day, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (US EIA, 2023b). Following an OPEC+ decision in October 2022 (Deepthi Nair, 2022), to cut production by twomillion barrels per day (mbpd) in an effort to keep oil prices up the UAE announced it would cut over 140,000 barrels per day from May 2023 until the end of the year (Gulf Today, 2023). However, the government also recently announced it was bringing forward its oil production capacity of five mbpd target (up from 3.8 mbpd currently), from 2030 to 2025, signalling its intent to ramp up production in the short term (Di Paola, 2022).

The UAE is also developing oil and gas offshore exploration and production. This is part of its efforts to reach “gas self-sufficiency” (ICLG, 2022). In February 2022, the first offshore fields were discovered, which are estimated to contain between 43 and 57 billion cubic metres of gas (AFP, 2022).

During 2022, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Drilling was awarded almost USD 6bn in contracts to “maximise value from Abu Dhabi’s offshore oil and gas resources” (World-Energy, 2022). In October 2023, ADNOC awarded contracts worth USD 17 bn for the Hail and Ghasha Offshore Development project. This project aims to produce 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of gas before the end of the decade (Reuters, 2023). This is part of a USD 150bn ADNOC plan to increase production of oil and gas.

According to the IEA, the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure beyond what was already committed in 2021 is incompatible with reaching net zero by 2050 (IEA, 2021). The UAE’s plans to further develop and invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These plans are also likely to lock the UAE into a high-emissions trajectory and undermine its transition to renewable energy. Instead of ramping up its gas production towards self-sufficiency, the UAE should set out an ambitious plan to phase-out its dependency on gas for electricity and avoid the risk of stranded assets (CAT, 2022).

In October 2023, ADNOC announced plans to double its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030 as part of its decarbonisation plan (Energy Voice, 2023). In a sustainable 1.5°C pathway, CCS with fossil fuels does not play a relevant role in energy sector decarbonisation, as renewable energy is much cheaper and has a much lower environmental footprint. The use of CCS needs be limited to industrial applications where it is proven there are no other options to reduce process emissions.

During COP26, the UAE unveiled its “Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap”, a strategy aimed at developing the domestic production of green and blue hydrogen aimed at export markets in Asia and Europe. The roadmap already includes seven projects which are either completed or underway (including blue ammonia production). The overarching target of the strategy is to reach a 25% market share in key markets such as India, Japan, Germany and others (H2 World News, 2021).

According to the UAE’s 2023 NDC update, several projects are already under way to support the country’s hydrogen ambitions, and a new Hydrogen Strategy is being prepared (Government of the UAE, 2023a). In its updated Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE also includes a target to produce 1.4 Mt of hydrogen annually by 2031. The UAE’s LTS includes additional information on its hydrogen development plans, including production targets of 7.3 Mt by 2040 and 14.9 Mt by 2050. Around half of the hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels with CCS (blue hydrogen), with the majority of the second half being green hydrogen and a small share coming from nuclear power (pink hydrogen) (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Buildings

The buildings sector accounted for ~28% of the UAE’s emissions in 2019. The UAE’s 2023 NDC update sets a target to reduce building emissions by 56% below 2019 levels by 2030, while its LTS targets a 98% reduction below 2019 levels by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). Emissions from the building sector are expected to be 27 MtCO2e in 2030 under the NDC from 2023, while under current policies they are expected to be 35 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a, 2024b).

As part of its Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE set out a target of reducing energy consumption by 40%. Several policies are in place to support this target in the buildings sector, including the National Water and Energy Demand Side Management Programme and a federal government building retrofit programme, aiming at 2000 retrofits by 2050. Some Emirates have also produced their own plans and policies to reduce energy consumption from the buildings sector, including Dubai’s plan to retrofit 30,000 buildings by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2022).

The majority of the emissions reductions in the building sector towards the UAE’s NDC target are expected to come from energy efficiency measures including more efficient heating and cooling, as well as demand side management initiatives. The emissions reductions necessary to reach the LTS target of 1 MtCO2e in 2050 will come almost entirely from reducing power and heat emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b).


## Waste

According to the UAE’s latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the waste sector accounted for 6% of the country’s emissions in 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE’s LTS sets a target for waste emissions, which are set to increase by 8% above 2019 levels by 2030 and should decrease by 75% below 2019 levels in 2050. Emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach 14 MtCO2e in 2030, up from 13 MtCO2e in 2019 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). This includes emissions from landfills as well as emissions stemming from energy used to transport and treat waste.

In January 2021, the UAE launched its Circular Economy Policy 2031, establishing a Circular Economy Council, tasked with supervising the implementation of waste reduction policies that also target the manufacturing sector. In May 2022, the Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant was launched, with a capacity of 30 MW. A further 200 MW plant is planned in Dubai and a 70 MW plant in Abu Dhabi, both expected to be operational in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2023a; Sharma, 2022).

However, the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy has no concrete waste or emissions reduction targets. We were not able to check whether its previous target of diverting 75% of its waste from landfills by 2021 (Government of the UAE, 2019) has been achieved. The UAE’s LTS includes a target of diverting 80% of its waste by 2031 and 90% by 2035. It also plans to capture the remaining methane produced in its landfills and retrofitting its waste-to-energy plants with CCS.

Under its net zero scenario, the UAE expects waste to contribute around 3 MtCO2e by 2050.


## Methane

The UAE signed the methane pledge at COP26, in which signatories agreed to cut methane emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. According to the UAE’s latest inventory, methane represented ~7% of total GHG emissions in 2021, mostly stemming from upstream fossil fuel production and waste (Government of the UAE, 2024a). The UAE already includes methane in its NDC and has some policies in place designed to reduce both energy and waste-related methane emissions.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions for the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2021 are taken from the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). For the years between 1994 and 2021 emissions are estimated by interpolating values between reported values. For the period 1990-1994 and 2021-2022 we estimate values by using growth rates from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024).

The UAE now includes an F-gases estimate in its latest national inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly related to data availability. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

The historical data used in our previous assessment estimated emissions to be around 15% higher in 2022 compared to our current assessment. The data from PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al., 2024) was based on the UAE’s latest inventory published in 2016, and used different methods to fill the gaps in the inventory and extend the estimates until 2022. The new GHG inventory published by the UAE in 2024 presents a significant upgrade in terms of data quality. The difference in economy-wide emissions estimates is mostly explained by a decrease in industrial process emissions, which are roughly half in the UAE’s own inventory compared to PRIMAP in 2022, and to differences in fugitive emissions data for 2021. According to PRIMAP’s estimates, the emissions they calculated for the UAE in 2022 based on their old inventory are 98% higher than the ones calculated based on the UAE’s new inventory for 2022. The UAE’s old inventory published in 2015 (Ministry of Energy, 2015) includes estimates for 1994 and 2014, while the new inventory published in 2024 (Government of the UAE, 2024a) includes an estimate only for 2021.


## NDC

The absolute emissions level for the NDC target incl. LULUCF is taken directly from the NDC document.

**F-gases**

Because F-gases are excluded from the UAE’s 2030 NDC target, the CAT adds them into the quantification of the NDC by assuming that F-gases remain constant from the last historical year (2021) until the target year (2030). The F-gases estimate comes from the UAE’s latest inventory data, submitted along with its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC (Government of the UAE, 2024a). However, there are still significant limitations regarding the UAE’s F-gases reporting, mainly due to data limitations. To address this, the UAE plans to broaden its monitoring and reporting activities, including exchanges with relevant stakeholders. While F-gases currently represent a negligible share of the UAE’s total GHG emissions (only 0.15 MtCO2e in 2021), this can change once the UAE updates its inventory again.

**LULUCF**

The target in the UAE’s 2023 NDC includes LULUCF emissions. To estimate the emissions level resulting from the target excluding LULUCF, we take the value for its 2030 LULUCF target (included in the NDC) and subtract it from the main NDC target.

**Global Warming Potential (GWP) values**

The UAE’s 2023 NDC specifies that it currently uses AR4 both for the BAU scenario and the NDC and sectoral targets. For the 2020 NDC, which was presented in SAR, we converted the 2030 BAU value from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor from the last available nationally reported historical data point (2021).


## Current policy projections

**Lower bound**

The UAE’s LTS includes current policy projections which are used as a baseline for the net zero scenario (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The current policy projections include all mitigation measures in force up to 2024 in all sectors of the economy, while the net zero scenario includes planned measures and their estimated contribution towards the target. The CAT uses the UAE’s LTS current policy scenario for the lower bound of its own current policy projections.

The CAT harmonizes the UAE’s LTS current policy scenarios to the latest available historical GHG emissions data (from 2022) using the growth rates of the original scenario for the period 2022-2035. The UAE only provided data for its current policies for the years 2019, 2030, 2040 and 2050. To create a pathway, the CAT linearly interpolates the values between these years.

Because the original projections include emissions and sinks from LULUCF, the CAT assumes that LULUCF emissions remain at 2019 levels (latest historical data available) under current policies. The UAE’s 2019 LULUCF emissions are -1 MtCO2e.

**Upper bound**

For the upper bound of our current policy projections, we estimate the impacts of the 2050 Energy Strategy on emissions with a range to reflect for uncertainties around the efficiency target and total energy generation. We use IRENA’s Renewable Energy Prospects report as our basis for energy-related CO2 emissions (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015) and calculate the difference in emissions that would result from the 2050 Energy Strategy.

The upper end of our range reflects the installed capacity targets for 2030 in the 2050 Energy Strategy, without calculating the impacts of energy efficiency measures. For this projection, we estimate total power generation by technology using capacity factors estimated based on the IRENA REMAP BAU scenario (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015).

In summary, the CPP upper end of the range for the UAE’s energy-related CO2 emissions is based on assumptions both about which targets will be implemented, as well as the role of fossil gas in the development of the power system.

For CO2 process emissions (from industry), we continue a linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030 (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015). For non-CO2 emissions, we apply the growth rate from the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 to PRIMAP historical data (US EPA, 2019).

We use the following data sources in our estimates:

- Energy-related CO2 from fuel combustion: “Renewable Energy Prospects – United Arab Emirates” (Masdar Institute/IRENA, 2015)
- CO2 process emissions (from industry): Own assumption to continue linear trend based on total industrial process emissions from the years 2011–2022 until 2030.
- Non-CO2 emissions: Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990–2030 (US EPA, 2019)
- Historical installed capacity data: IRENA capacity and generation statistics 2023 (IRENASTAT, 2023)
- Historical electricity generation data: IEA World Energy Balances 2022 (IEA, 2022)
- Historical emissions factors: IEA Emissions Factors 2021 (IEA, 2021a).

## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UAE’s net zero strategy covers all GHG emissions except F-gases and assumes a 3.5 MtCO2e sink in 2050 to assist with achieving the country’s net zero target and so that is the value taken for their net zero target excluding LULUCF.

Due to the uncertainty in estimating F-gases emissions in the UAE by 2050, the CAT does not include any estimation when calculating the UAE’s 2050 emissions excluding LULUCF. This can change in future updates once new emissions data for historical years and future projections are available.


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

The UAE submitted an updated NDC for 2030 in July 2023 after having already strengthened its NDC target in 2022. With the UAE’s emissions still set to increase by 2030, we estimate it will not be able to meet this updated NDC target, nor the former one.

The NDC from 2023 has an unconditional and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 182 MtCO2e (including emissions from land use and forestry, or LULUCF) by 2030 (Government of the UAE, 2023a). The CAT rates this target, excluding LULUCF, as “Almost sufficient” compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

In October 2021 the UAE announced its intention to reach net zero emissions as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b). The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s net zero target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero.


## NDC updates

The UAE submitted a 2035 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 06 November 2024. The CAT’s analysis of the UAE’s 2035 NDC target can be found here.

The UAE submitted a stronger 2030 NDC target to the UNFCCC on 11 July 2023. While the UAE needs to put forward substantially improved climate policies to reach the NDC, it is an improvement on the former NDC in the following ways:

- It includes strengthened emissions reduction target—to limit emissions to 182 MtCO2e by 2030 (including LULUCF), down from 208 MtCO2e (Government of the UAE, 2023a).
- The target is now expressed as an absolute emissions limit. The previous target was a reduction below a business as usual (BAU) scenario.
- The NDC provides sectoral targets for the electricity and water generation, industry, transport, buildings, waste and agriculture sub-sectors.
- It includes details of the policies and measures planned to achieve the sectoral targets, a step forward in transparency.
We have estimated this new unconditional target will result in an emissions level of 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), a 12% improvement compared to the previous target of 211 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF). The target covers all sectors of the economy and major greenhouse gases—CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The CAT’s calculation of the UAE’s 2030 NDC target also includes PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and HFCs which are not covered by the target. For this calculation, the CAT assumes that F-gases remain constant from the last available historical data point (2021). In its latest National Communication to the UNFCCC, the UAE reported its latest GHG inventory covering the years 1994, 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2021. The F-gases value for 2021 is 0.15 MtCO2e in AR4 (Government of the UAE, 2024a).

This new target represents a targeted decrease in emissions of 14% below 2022 levels (excl. LULUCF).

The NDC mentions many of the policies and strategies that underpin the 2030 target. This includes the UAE’s National Energy Strategy 2050, which aims for 44% of renewable and 6% of nuclear energy in installed electric capacity by 2050, while reducing final electricity demand by 42–45% (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

This strategy was recently updated to remove its previous target of 12% of coal capacity by 2050, which is now replaced by an increased fossil gas capacity from 38% to 50%. This updated strategy continues to be inconsistent with the need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050, due to the continued long-term reliance on fossil gas (Government of the UAE, 2023b).

The UAE reserves the option to use carbon credits for emission reductions abroad under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own domestic emissions to achieve its NDC target (Government of the UAE, 2023a). Although it has not yet announced any firm details of how it will secure carbon credits towards its climate targets (either the NDC or net zero), a privately owned Emirati company called Blue Carbon has recently made headlines for its carbon credit deals. Since its inception in 2022, the company has signed MOU's with the governments of Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to acquire conservation rights for around 60 million acres of their forests, to generate carbon credits from projects avoiding deforestation, and sell them on the market (Pearce, 2023).

Details on how the government of the UAE intends to purchase credits from Blue Carbon or other similar providers to support claims to offset its own emissions are unclear. This ambiguity presents major risks that the UAE will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. The use of credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should complement and not serve to distract from or displace critically needed mitigation efforts domestically.

The UAE’s 2030 NDC submitted in 2023 shows an increase in ambition and has improved its transparency by sharing sectoral targets and more details on the measures planned to achieve them. However, the UAE’s current plans for its oil and gas industry and its power sector continue to be incompatible with its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

- 29.12.2020 The UAE submits an updated NDC with first economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and "Insufficient" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways.

CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update.

For more details, please see the Assumptions section.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023).

We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.


# Summary


## Overview

**Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans.** **The** **CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”.**

**This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found** **here****.**

There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections.

Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO2e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate.

The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share.

Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further.

In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years.

The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO2e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO2e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans.

The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions.

In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy. The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS.

The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO2e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions.

There are some positive developments in the UAE, including:

- The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory,
- The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund,
- The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario,
- The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios,
- Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad.
To improve its climate action, the UAE could:

- Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas,
- Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible,
- Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT rates the UAE’s policies and actions as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s policies and action rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons.

First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050.

These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies.

The UAE’s LTS, published in 2024, includes targets and current policy projections for all major sectors of the economy, and detail both existing and planned measures to achieve them. While this is a significant step in transparency, it also shows that the UAE plans to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies especially after 2030 and towards its 2050 target, which undermines the credibility of its climate policies and targets.

The full policies and action analysis can be found here.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UAE’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons:

First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC.

Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

The CAT evaluates the UAE's net zero target as: **Average**.

In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions.

The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**

In January 2024, just weeks after COP28, the UAE submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC, including its 2050 net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b)The LTS officially communicates longer-term targets beyond 2030. In 2021 the UAE had already announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative.

The LTS significantly improves the clarity of the UAE’s net-zero target and covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the government has enshrined the target into law, provides a transparent assumption on the use of carbon dioxide removal in the target year, and establishes a legally-binding review process of the target in five-year intervals. We evaluate the comprehensiveness of the UAE’s net zero target as ‘average’, an upgrade from the ‘poor’ rating ahead of the LTS submission.

Despite this progress, the UAE has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could include F-gases, international aviation, and international shipping under its target coverage, or explain why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

Additionally, it is concerning that the UAE's plans to increase use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target, and also has a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither commercially viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). The UAE’s major oil and gas expansion plans are clearly not in line with a global transition to net zero emissions. According to the IEA (2023), there should be no new investments into oil and gas projects under a net zero scenario.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The UAE aims to reach net zero by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The UAE specifies that the target covers CO2, CH4 and N2O across all economic sectors, while explicitly excluding F-gases. The government claims that these gases cover around 95% of all emissions (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 45). However, according to the latest available historical data (third-party, not nationally reported), F-gas emissions represented 9% of total UAE emissions in 2022 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – While the UAE generally plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and does not intend to use removals outside its own borders, it reserves the rights to use international offset credits “to achieve net zero in adverse local circumstances” (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). The government might further use international offset credits under the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 to go beyond its net zero target (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Legal status** – The UAE includes its net zero target in its first long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2024. According to the LTS, the cabinet has further enshrined the target into domestic law (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 90). In March 2023, the United Arab Emirates Cabinet signed the “UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter”.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UAE specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets (Government of the UAE, 2024, p. 49).
- **Review process** – The UAE commits to regularly review and revise its net zero target in a legally binding process (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 91). It plans updates to its LTS (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 92).
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The UAE provides transparent assumptions on its intended use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The government intends to reach 3.5 MtCO2e of LULUCF sinks through expanded mangroves (compared to around 1 MtCO2e in 2023) and 9.5 MtCO2e of engineered CDR through direct air capture technologies (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 88).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UAE’s 2023 LTS provides sector-level pathways, emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050. The UAE's planned use of fossil gas to meet its net zero target implies a heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is neither viable, nor one that reduces emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). More specific planning for the energy mix towards 2040 and 2050 remains a work in progress (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 50). In previous iterations of its 2050 Energy Strategy, the UAE still foresaw a major role for fossil gas in 2050.The UAE also foresees a big role for CCS in the industry sector, where it will account for 32% of all emission reductions by 2050 (Government of the UAE, 2024b, pp. 58–60), equivalent to around 44 MtCO2e. CCS will be used for heavy industrial processes (steel, cement, aluminium, others), oil and fossil gas processing, and refineries. The government further plans to expand the hydrogen production using fossil gas (so-called ‘blue’ hydrogen) to around 50% of the total hydrogen production by 2040 and 2050.The UAE states that it intends to further expand its oil and gas production to meet global demand (Government of the UAE, 2024b, p. 57), while it refers to the 2045 net zero target by its state-own ADNOC oil and gas company. The latter target, however, only covers operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) while excluding all use-phase emissions of burning the exported oil and gas (ADNOC, 2023). Such "scope 3" emissions account for the majority of ADNOC emissions along its value chain and ought to be covered by corporate net zero targets as mandated by the UN High Level Expert Group (UN HLEG, 2022).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The UAE makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.
