Climate Action Tracker Spider

Created by Dr Jon Cardoso-Silva as part of the 
[DS205 course](https://lse-dsi.github.io/DS205) at LSE.

This spider is designed to demonstrate ethical web scraping practices
while collecting climate action data from various countries.

To run the spider for all mapped URLs, use the following command:

    cd climate_tracker
    scrapy crawl climate_action_tracker -O ./data/output.json

To test or run the same spider for a single URL, use the following command:

    cd climate_tracker
    scrapy parse https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/uk/ --spider climate_action_tracker -O ./data/output.json

ACTIVATE   
python -m venv scraping-env
source scraping-env/bin/activate

CRAWL 
cd climate_tracker
scrapy crawl climate_action_tracker -O output.json
