EU,Overview,no rating,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated her mandate for the next four years is to continue to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal (EGD), but will focus on implementation rather than increasing ambition. The EU has made significant progress in adopting the measures of the European Green Deal bringing it closer to achieving its 2030 target, but more action is required to close the gap. However, the EU is not fully on track to meet its 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% below 1990 (including LULUCF). The CAT therefore rates the EU’s overall climate action and current 2030 emissions reduction target as ‘Insufficient’. The Commission's proposed 2040 target is a net 90% reduction in emissions below 1990, which represents the least ambitious end of the 90–95% range proposed by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC). The EU does not yet have a target specifically for 2035 emission reductions. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at least 74% (excl. LULUCF), or a 78% reduction (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance and other support for developing countries. The CAT finds that the EU’s proposed 2040 target of at least 90–95% reduction (including LULUCF) results in an emissions reduction of 85% when excluding LULUCF. This emission reduction target for 2040 would be consistent with 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways. There remains an open question however as to whether or not the emission pathway of the European Union from 2030 through 2040 is 1.5° aligned as whole and that can only be assessed once the European Union has submitted the relevant targets. The EU has signalled that it recognises the importance of scaling up international climate finance and while it has been increasing its contributions, it would need drastically increase its financial support to achieve its own commitments. Positively, the EU has worked to mobilise more private finance, through for example the EU Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to make sustainable investments more transparent. The latter is currently being assessed to address its shortfalls around its sustainability criteria. In 2023 at COP28, the EU called for a global phase-out of “unabated” fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies not used for a just transition, however the European Union has not yet moved to establish concrete domestic phase out targets for fossil fuels which would be needed to operationalise the transition away from these fuels as a matter of urgency. As a major importer of fossil fuels this will be an important initiative. The EU has made significant progress over the past four years with the European Green Deal. Prior to the EGD, in 2019 the EU’s planned policies were projected to achieve only a 33% emission reduction by 2030 below 1990 levels. With its current planned policies, it is on track to achieve a 52% reduction. In 2024 alone, the EU successfully adopted key proposals under the EGD. Some of the major accomplishments included the revisions of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, the Gas Regulation and Directive and the Methane Regulation. Positively these packages: Establish more ambitious mandates for renovating Europe’s buildings to be more efficient than before and signal a shift to move away from fossil fuels. Establish a framework for a hydrogen market, enabling the scaling up of hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of certain sectors such as industry and shipping. Introduce new requirements for the fossil fuel industry to monitory and report methane emission and to take appropriate mitigation measures to abate their emissions. While these are positive steps in the right direction, many gaps and loopholes in these regulations remain and in some cases were missed opportunities to establish fossil fuel phase out and sector specific targets. To continue improving its climate action, the EU should: Stop investing in additional fossil gas infrastructure and focus its efforts on the renewable energy transition. This would also entail closing loopholes which make exceptions for fossil fuels, particularly LNG, to prevent the risk of long-term lock-in investments, Agree to a full phase out fossil fuels across all sectors, with coal phased out altogether by 2030, and fossil gas by 2035, Strictly limit its dependence on carbon capture and storage through to 2050 to only those sectors where there is no reasonable alternative to abatement at source or whole of system changes that could be deployed to eliminate CO 2 emissions without the application of CCS. The EU should not allow CCS in the power sector as the sector can decarbonise completely without this technology, Agree on an ambitious 2035 target of at least 78% below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) and including fossil fuel phase-out dates, Substantially increase its climate finance contributions , including through returning revenues from the new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support decarbonisation in developing countries, and Update its long-term strategy for reaching its net zero target , especially given that the EU Commission has assessed Member States’ progress towards the EU’s climate neutrality target as insufficient."
EU,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
EU,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates the EU’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. We rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution and to modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, the EU should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target for 2030 to at least 62% (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) below 1990, close gaps and remove loopholes in existing policies prolonging fossil fuel use, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. The EU’s policies and action are also rated “Insufficient”. With the full implementation of the EU’s planned policies under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU initiatives the EU will come close to meeting its NDC target for 2030. However, not all proposals under the Fit for 55 package have been adopted. Targets and measures under available member states’ National Energy and Climate Plans are also failing to meet the EU’s targets, and half of member states have not submitted these plans. The overall lack of ambition of the EU’s 2030 NDC target will mean that it will need to adopt more rapid and deeper emission reduction measures later, in order to achieve a 1.5°C compatible pathway to climate neutrality by mid-century."
EU,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"Current and planned policies will not be enough for the EU to reach its NDC target. The CAT rates the EU’s climate policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. This represents no change from the previous assessment as there have been no major new policy developments. Since our last assessment (February 2024), the EU has adopted several proposals, such as the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. However, others are still on the table, most notably the 2040 climate targets and Energy Taxation Directive, which we consider under our updated planned policies projections. The upper bound of our policies and action emissions projection range is based on policies reported by member states in 2023, which would result in an emissions reduction of around 43% (excl. LULUCF) below 1990 by 2030. The bottom end of the range is based on policies adopted at the EU level, including the stronger binding renewable energy target (42.5%), which would result in reducing emissions by 49% (excl. LULUCF). Our updated planned policies projection shows the EU comes close to achieving its NDC if all its proposals under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are implemented, achieving a 51% emissions reduction from 1990. The projection includes the EU’s indicative renewable energy goal (45%) and additional measures planned. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
EU,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"In October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC with a target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) - which is the same as the previous EU NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO 2 e, implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the 2030 target equates to 52% below 1990 levels. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C."
Costa Rica,Overview,no rating,"Note: We have updated the text assessment to reflect the latest policy developments in Costa Rica. The CAT’s ratings and data are from our 2023 evaluation and will be updated soon. Costa Rica has made good progress towards its climate goals. This shows in the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and the enhancement of carbon sinks. However, the current administration are sending worrying signals that the full implementation of the climate policies and measures necessary to meet Costa Rica’s own targets could be deterred. Key electric public transportation projects have been on pause or have been downscaled in ambition. The oil moratorium bill also faces challenges, as President Chaves has announced his opposition to it, along with his intention to explore Costa Rica’s fossil fuel reserves. Despite these recent developments, the CAT still rates Costa Rica’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The most important climate policy in Costa Rica is its National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP), which sets out economy-wide policies and actions to meet its net zero target. While Costa Rica had regularly published updates on the implementation of the NDP, the most recent iteration of the report (from 2022) only evaluated progress up to 2021. Some of the most significant goals of the first implementation phase that were considered ‘at risk’ of not being achieved, such as the electrified rail projects, are still under scrutiny by the current government. If this trend persists, Costa Rica's chances of meeting its 2030 emissions targets becomes increasingly unlikely. Between 2015 and 2022, Costa Rica generated nearly 100% of its electricity from renewables, mainly hydropower. This decreased to 95% in 2023 due to low rainfall conditions. This decreasing trend escalated in 2024, with a quarter of Costa Rica’s electricity generation coming from fossil-fuel-powered thermal plants in April, although this has dropped to under 10% as of July. To sustain renewable electricity production, Costa Rica needs to take steps to diversify its electricity mix, especially by expanding solar and wind capacity. Costa Rica has reached a considerable national market share of EVs, making up 12% of total vehicle sales in 2023. It has also advanced the deployment of key infrastructure to support its growing EV fleet, although the installation rate of fast charging points has not kept up with EV growth. On the other hand, the steps to electrify public transport and promote modal shift have either made little progress or have been scaled down in ambition, with public transport projects decreasing their planned coverage or not running as a fully electric unit (i.e. diesel-hybrids). Costa Rica could set itself on a firm 1.5°C-compatible trajectory by considering the following actions: Setting a conditional NDC target which also outlines the international support necessary to achieve it. Ratifying the oil moratorium , originally declared in 2002, to enshrine the bill into law and ensure that Costa Rica does not become an oil producer. Continue to monitor and report progress on the implementation of the National Decarbonisation Plan to ensure that its goals are achieved by Costa Rica’s current policies and mitigation actions. Diversify its renewable energy portfolio to reduce overreliance on hydropower for electricity generation, which is heavily affected by weather conditions. Since the last CAT update, there have also been some positive developments in Costa Rica’s climate policies, including: A rapid increase in EV sales. The continued development of new policies and initiatives (e.g. NAMAs) to address emissions in the agriculture sector, which accounts for a notable share of Costa Rica’s emissions. The biofuel mandate will require gas stations to incorporate 10% ethanol into their gasoline and is a positive sign that some main objectives of the National Decarbonisation Plan are being met, provided it does not result in emissions increases elsewhere."
Costa Rica,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Costa Rica,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Costa Rica’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that while Costa Rica’s climate policies are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit, its climate commitments are not, but could be with moderate improvements. Costa Rica’s 2030 emissions reduction target of “maximum absolute net emissions of 9.11 MtCO 2 e incl. LULUCF” is rated as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and “1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. Given that the target already meets its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, Costa Rica should receive external support to implement its additional climate policies and further strengthen its reduction target."
Costa Rica,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"We rate Costa Rica’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Costa Rica’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Costa Rica has made strides in implementing its National Decarbonisation Plan, but some key policies and projects have yet to be realised, especially those related to electric transportation and modal shift. On the other hand, Costa Rica’s efforts have been evident in the significant uptake of EVs, which made up 12% of vehicle sales in 2023. The large majority of Costa Rica’s electricity comes from renewable sources, but in 2024 a notable share of thermal energy (from burning fossil fuels) has been used to compensate for reduced hydropower production due to drought. Efforts to enshrine the fossil fuel moratorium into law have also faced challenges during the legislative process. Costa Rica should focus on expanding the use of its many renewable energy sources instead of increasing its dependence on fossil fuels. If Costa Rica wants to maintain its 1.5°C compatibility, it should ensure that the measures under the National Decarbonisation Plan continue to be implemented and should also avoid increased fossil fuel use through abandoning the moratorium. The full analysis of policies and action can be found here ."
Costa Rica,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Costa Rica’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Costa Rica’s NDC target is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. Costa Rica’s updated climate target represents an improvement compared to its first NDC, however, it is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Costa Rica could submit a 2030 climate target that is at least 7% lower than its current target (equivalent to an absolute emissions limit of 11 MtCO 2 e excl. LULUCF in 2030) and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it."
Costa Rica,NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,We rate Costa Rica’s 2030 NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Costa Rica’s NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to its fair share.
Costa Rica,Land use & forestry,Sink,"Costa Rica has drastically reduced its LULUCF emissions over the past 20 years, reaching net negative emissions in 2014. In 2017, Costa Rica’s LULUCF emissions sink was equivalent to more than 20% of its economy-wide emissions. Costa Rica is counting on the LULUCF sector to achieve its carbon neutrality goal. To meet the emissions trajectory outlined in its LTS, the LULUCF sink would have to more than double compared to current levels. Thus, Costa Rica should work towards increasing its LULUCF sink in the long-term. For more information about forestry activities in Costa Rica, please see the Forestry section under Policies & Action ."
Costa Rica,Net zero target,Acceptable,"We evaluate the net zero target as “Acceptable”. Costa Rica’s target covers all sectors and gases and is underpinned by emissions pathway analysis and the communication of strategic goals and emissions targets per sector. The Costa Rican government provides comprehensive pathways and key measures and sets interim goals attributable to discernible periods. The government plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and without the use of international credits. That said, the government currently fails to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on key elements. The government also provides no information on its intention to establish a formal periodic reviewing cycle of measures and interim targets."
Colombia,Overview,no rating,"In August 2022, the newly elected president Gustavo Petro took office, pledging to put climate change at the top of his political agenda: to protect forests, reduce emissions from deforestation, make a sustainable energy transition away from oil investment, and stop fracking. In his inaugural speech , he mentioned the importance of Colombia moving to a low-carbon economy and strongly committed to a low-carbon transition conditional on international cooperation. Since taking office, he has already moved to ban fracking, with draft legislation already out for review. Colombia needs to take stronger action to cut emissions across the board. In 2020, Colombia updated its NDC with a stronger target, but it did not go far enough. It is not on track to meet its updated NDC with current policies resulting around 24% over target. Even with planned measures, Colombia will need further action both to reach its current target and to be 1.5°C compatible. In December 2021, Colombia enacted the Climate Action Law, enshrining both its NDC and net zero targets into law. To enhance climate action, Colombia should sign up to the coal exit. It depends on coal for roughly 10% of its power supply, economically accounting for about 13% of total exports in 2020.The Colombian coal mining sector is facing uncertainty as pressure mounts for firms to decarbonise foreign investments. The latest long-term expansion plan from the National Energy Planning Unit rules out completely new coal-fired power plants due to low competitiveness against major growth of cheaper renewable sources. The development of renewables and the global drive towards decarbonisation may risk leaving Colombia with stranded assets and lost economic opportunities if it does not initiate the transition away from fossil fuels. It is too soon to gauge whether the new President will be able to achieve this. Colombia can also strengthen its 2030 electric vehicle (EV) target and accelerate the establishing of charging infrastructure. We estimate that its current 2030 EV target is equivalent to about a 50% EV sales target. While Colombia has a number of EV policies, recent legislative developments supporting natural gas take the sector in the wrong direction. In August 2021, Colombia passed law 2128, which declared the use of natural gas to be in the national interest. The CAT’s rating of Colombia’s overall and target ratings have improved compared to our last assessment because Colombia provided further information in its latest biennial report on the policies and measures it will implement to achieve its target. While the overall NDC target remains the same, Colombia will focus more on reducing emissions outside of the land sector (LULUCF) than we had previously assumed, therefore leading to a more stringent target (when excluding LULUCF) under our methods. Colombia’s overall rating has changed from “Highly insufficient” to “Insufficient”."
Colombia,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT gives Colombia’s climate targets and policies an overall rating of “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Colombia’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Colombia’s NDC target is consistent with 3°C of warming when compared to modelled emissions pathways and 2°C of warming when compared to its fair share contribution. Colombia needs to strengthen its unconditional NDC target and make it even more ambitious with international support. Colombia will not meet its NDC target neither with the current policies and action, nor with its planned policies. Colombia will need to implement additional policies using its own resources but will also need international support to implement further policies in line with full decarbonisation. Colombia’s overall and target ratings have improved compared to our last assessment, due changes in the methods we use to exclude LULUCF from the NDC, rather than any change in the target itself."
Colombia,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"Colombia’s current policies and action are not 1.5°C compatible when compared to its expected fair share contribution. Under current policy projections, Colombia’s 2030 emissions are likely to fall between 199-203 MtCO 2 e excl. LULUCF, which is far above its fair share contribution of 139 MtCO 2 e in 2030 for a 1.5°C consistent pathway. Planned policies are estimated to cut emissions to between 176-180 MtCO 2 e in 2030, which is insufficient to meet Colombia’s NDC target (161 MtCO 2 e excluding LULUCF). Further policy action is needed. We rate Colombia’s policies and action as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Colombia’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Colombia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Colombia will need to implement additional policies using its own resources but will also need international support to implement further policies in line with full decarbonisation. For more on Colombia's policies and action, click here ."
Colombia,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"Colombia has not put forward a conditional target, and so we rate its NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and find it to be “Insufficient”. The CAT methodology shows that provision of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement's goals. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Colombia’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Colombia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Colombia’s rating has improved by one category, from “Highly insufficient” to “Insufficient”. The change is due to the manner in which we exclude LULUCF from the NDC, rather than any change in the target itself. In our last assessment, we indicated that there was significant uncertainty on the extent to which Colombia intends to rely on the land sector and so we developed a target range based on different approaches. Due to the further information provided in the country’s latest biennial report, we have dropped the upper end of our range (see Assumptions tab for further details)."
Colombia,NDC target against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"Colombia’s NDC target is also inconsistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to its fair share contribution. We estimate the target to be 161 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). To achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, Colombia would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 139 MtCO 2 e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates Colombia’s NDC target as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Colombia ’s fair share target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. Colombia’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Colombia’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Colombia’s rating has improved by one category, from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient”. The change is due to the manner in which we exclude LULUCF from the NDC, rather than any change in the target itself (see the Assumptions tab for further details)."
Colombia,Land use & forestry,Source,"The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been significant source of emissions in Colombia. Emissions from land use in 2018 were 36% of the country’s total emissions, and reducing emissions from deforestation is a vital part of Colombia’s climate mitigation target (IDEAM, 2021). Land-based mitigation measures account for approximately 70% of the total mitigation potential outlined in its updated NDC (2020), which, if fully implemented, would turn Colombia’s land sector from a current net source of emissions to a net sink."
Colombia,Net zero target,Acceptable,"In November 2021, Colombia submitted a 2050 net zero GHG emissions target as National Long Term Strategy ( E2050 ) to the UNFCCC. The Strategy includes different scenarios and pathways and outlines 9 strategic initiatives with 48 transformation options for decision-makers to consider (Government of Colombia, 2021). In December 2021, through Law No. 2169, Colombia promotes the country's low-carbon development through the establishment of minimum targets and measures for carbon neutrality and climate resilience (Ley de Accion Climatica N°2169, 2021) We evaluate Colombia’s net-zero target as “acceptable”. The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
China,Overview,no rating,"China’s emissions in 2023 reached an all-time high due to a rapid rebound in economic activities and fossil fuel consumption after the end of zero-COVID policies. However, thanks to the rapid rollout of renewables and a significant reduction in new coal power projects, the most recent projections suggest that China's emissions will peak before 2025, potentially more than five years ahead of its 2030 target, albeit at a higher level. While there are early signs in 2024 that emissions may be starting to decline from the 2023 peak, it remains uncertain how the rest of the year will unfold. China has surpassed its NDC target for wind and solar capacity six years ahead of schedule, reaching 1,206 GW in July 2024, with forecasts predicting 1,310 GW by year-end. The country's non-fossil power generation capacity now exceeds that of fossil fuels. However, coal remains China’s primary energy source and the largest emissions source. Although coal power permits dropped by 83% in the first half of 2024, new coal plant construction remains high due to the surge in approvals of over 100 GW during 2022-2023. Despite this expansion, coal plant utilisation rates are declining, with coal's share of electricity generation falling to 53% in May 2024 from 60% in May 2023, as renewable energy and hydropower recover. The CAT’s overall rating for China’s policies and targets remains “Highly insufficient”. We estimate China’s 2023 emissions rose 3% to 14.9 GtCO₂e (excl. LULUCF) compared to 2022, driven by increased coal and oil consumption after the economic rebound from its zero-COVID policy, and further compounded by weak hydropower production due to scarce rainfall. We expect absolute 2030 emission levels to be up by 0.5-1.6%, compared with our previous assessment, reaching 13.8 to 14.6 GtCO 2 e (excl. LULUCF). Our conservative scenario expects China’s emissions to peak before 2025, followed by a slight annual decline of 0.5% for the rest of the decade. An optimistic scenario, with accelerated renewable deployment and coal phase-down, suggests CO 2 emissions could peak as early as 2023, with a steeper annual decline of 1%, resulting in an additional 5% emission reduction, or 750 MtCO 2 , by 2030. In both our optimistic and conservative projections, China’s climate and energy policies are currently not expected to be strong enough to drive down emissions in a substantial manner this decade. For a chance to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, it is critically important for China as the world’s largest emitter to rapidly decarbonise in the short-term by implementing more ambitious decarbonisation policies in its next five-year plan (2026-2030). As in previous years, our analysis shows emission levels under domestic policies to be lower than China’s energy-related NDC targets . We project China to comfortably overachieve its non-fossil energy share and renewable capacity targets without substantially increasing its mitigation efforts, despite an increased emissions trajectory. China’s wind and solar power capacity has been growing at a record pace, averaging 27% annually over the past five years, surpassing its 1,200 GW target six years ahead of schedule. If China manages to keep up this extraordinary momentum, renewables could meet all its generation capacity demand by 2030, though it would be an enormous challenge. Given China's continued reliance on fossil fuels, even with an average economic growth of 5% per year in 2024-25, the country may still miss its carbon intensity target—a reduction of 18% by 2025 from 2020 levels—because emissions have not been dropping as expected. This risk is compounded by significant economic losses from extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, exemplified by the severe flooding in Guangdong, Henan, and Hunan provinces during the summer of 2024. To strengthen its climate policy and to keep emissions in line with its 2060 carbon neutrality target, China could: Control and reduce fossil fuel dependence, as energy consumption is projected to rise almost 9% from now to 2030. While record rates of renewable deployment are on the verge of meeting growing energy demand, this is not yet able to meaningfully cut fossil fuel consumption and bring down emissions in the medium-term. High-level political signals, including President Xi Jinping’s speech at the 20th CPC National Congress and the 2024 Government Work Report from the “Two Sessions” (annual plenary sessions of two of China’s major political bodies), emphasise energy security with coal as a key solution. China reduced coal power permits by 83% year-on-year in the first half of 2024, approving only 9 GW , signalling positive progress. But over the same period, construction began on over 41 GW of coal projects, still representing over 90% of global new coal construction. Improve the formulation and coverage of its climate targets by setting an absolute economy-wide peaking target for greenhouse gas emissions as well as specific emission reduction targets for 2035. China’s existing peaking, carbon intensity, and non-fossil energy share targets are relative to economic growth or energy system developments, allowing the country to meet its NDC commitments while increasing emissions levels. The NDC and LTS targets do not directly cover non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, which amount to 2.5 GtCO₂e/yr or almost 18% of China’s total emissions, although China has now pledged to include all GHGs in its 2035 NDC. Raise the ambition of its energy-related climate (NDC) targets: China reached its 1,200 GW wind and solar capacity target six years ahead of schedule, totalling 1,206 GW by the end of July 2024. China is also on track to meet its 25% non-fossil energy share target by 2030, with our projections suggesting it could surpass 30% in both conservative and optimistic scenarios. Accelerate decarbonisation of high-emitting industry sectors by bringing carbon peaking timelines forward, as well as expanding the ETS sector coverage and improving its design. Industry associations and research from public institutions have suggested earlier carbon peaking timelines are feasible for critical sectors such as cement, steel and non-ferrous metals. Production control has been a key solution for China’s industrial emission reduction: after halting new permits for coal-based steel plants in the first half of 2024, the government has now indefinitely suspended all new steel plant permits. While China’s dependency on fossil fuels and high emission levels looks set to stay for the immediate future, the energy transition continues to build momentum, highlighted by high rates of renewable installations, deepening reforms in the power sector, and mitigation policies in end-use sectors: China’s energy transition investments in non-fossil energy, storage, electric vehicles and the circular economy remain a global leader, accounting for 38% of the global total in 2023. Renewable energy is rapidly expanding, driven by 14th FYP targets such as generating 3300 TWh of electricity from renewable sources and having renewables make up at least half of incremental power demand growth 2021- 2025. In the first seven months of 2024, China added 160 GW of renewable energy (incl. hydro), which accounted for 87% of new installations. This brought the total renewable capacity to 1,690 GW , making up 54.5% of the country's total power generation capacity. Wind and solar power reached 1,206 GW by the end of July and is forecasted by the China Electricity Council (CEC) to reach 1,310 GW by the end of 2024. China is rapidly becoming an electric vehicle (EV) powerhouse, now producing over half of all EVs sold worldwide. Domestically, China's new energy vehicles (mainly EVs) reached a market share of 31.6% in 2023, way ahead of its target of 20% by 2025. It has also released various industry and building sector plans, setting numerous efficiency targets for 2025, some of which rank among the most ambitious globally ."
China,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
China,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates China’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that China’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit and lead to a plateau of high, rather than falling, emissions levels. China is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. China’s unconditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share. China’s unconditional NDC is rated as “Highly insufficient” compared with modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, China should set an ambitious and economy-wide absolute emission reduction target and adopt policies to reduce dependence on coal, thereby setting its national emissions on a downward trend."
China,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"China's suite of sectoral 14th Five Year Plans set out a range of mitigation measures to prepare the country for a post-coal transition but is unable to counter growing energy demand and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Under current policies, emissions in 2030 have increased by 0.5-1.6% from the previous assessment, making it more difficult to reach long-term carbon neutrality. The country is expected to well overachieve its energy-related NDC targets, yet it risks failing in meeting its carbon intensity target for the first time. The CAT gives China’s climate policies a rating of “Insufficient”. This rating is an improvement over the previous assessment of ""Highly Insufficient."" The change is due to the CAT now rating policies and actions against fair share, rather than the previously used modelled domestic pathway. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
China,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"Under China’s NDC targets, the country’s emission levels would reach 14.0 GtCO 2 e/year in 2030. This projection, based on the median value of conservative and optimistic estimates from the two most binding energy-related NDC targets (peaking and carbon intensity targets), represents a 28% increase from 2010 levels. The country’s existing policies are set to overachieve the NDC targets for the share of non-fossil fuel consumption and the capacity of wind and solar power. This indicates potential for further raising these commitments. However, it is not yet sufficient to ensure that China meets its carbon intensity target. The CAT keeps its rating of China’s NDC target against modelled domestic pathways in 2030 as “Highly Insufficient”, indicating that its 2030 domestic targets need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit."
China,NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"China’s emission levels under its NDC commitments are higher than what would be deemed 1.5°C compatible compared to our “fair share” approach, resulting in our improved rating of the NDC against China’s fair share of “Insufficient”. This upgrade in rating compared to the previous assessment is due to changes in the underlying data rather than any actual change in the target. This rating takes into account the fact that China has effectively submitted an unconditional NDC target but has not indicated a level of emissions that would be achieved with international support (a conditional NDC target)."
China,Net zero target,Poor,"China’s President Xi Jinping first announced China’s commitment to reach “carbon neutrality before 2060” in a declaration at the UN General Assembly in September 2020. China has since officially submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in October 2021. As the LTS submission does not meet the majority of our criteria for a best-practice approach in LTS formulation, we keep China’s net-zero target evaluation as “Poor”."
Chile,Overview,no rating,"Chile has made considerable progress on climate action over the past few years following the enactment of the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2022. This is reflected in the rapid rate of renewables expansion and the coal phase-out plan going faster than anticipated. With this update, the CAT’s overall rating of Chile’s climate targets and actions has improved to “Almost sufficient”, one of the few countries to earn this rating. The impact of Chile’s coal phase-out could be lessened, however, if it results in higher natural gas consumption from planned reconversions. Eight coal-fired units have yet to make a retirement commitment: they are not obliged to stop operating until 2040. The implementation of measures in the energy end-use and other sectors, transport in particular, has also been occurring at a slower pace than what is needed to meet Chile’s commitments under its climate target (NDC) and related policy documents. According to our estimates, Chile's emissions have already peaked, in 2021, ahead of its 2025 commitment in the NDC. However, Chile will not be able to meet its 2030 NDC target under current policies. Chile’s upper end of its current policy projections also sits in the “Insufficient” range, meaning a lack of implementation of mitigation policies and increased natural gas consumption from retrofitting coal plants could result in a worse rating for Chile. Since our previous assessment, Chile has finalised its National Mining Policy 2050, which includes a target for the industry sector to reach carbon neutrality by 2040, in addition to zero fleet and renewable electricity objectives. New laws to promote renewable energy and address critical barriers like the lack of transmission lines, such as the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility and the Energy Transition Law have been in the legislative process for a couple of years now. Chile has also published new sectoral strategies to guide its short-term climate plans such as the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan, the Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, as well as the Green Hydrogen Action Plan 2023–2030. Chile has outlined its short-term measures for promoting its green hydrogen industry and becoming a top exporter by 2040 and is in the process of piloting its domestically produced hydrogen bus by early next year. Chile’s coal phase-out is well on track, with some units retiring faster than expected. More than 1.2 GW of coal capacity from 11 plants has been retired since 2019. Another nine plants have made commitments to retire or convert to natural gas by the end of 2025. This is in line with the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan target to retire or reconvert 70% of coal-fired units by the end of 2025, representing 3.6 GW in capacity. Gas must still be phased out in the short-term, however, and Chile should be careful when repurposing plants to avoid carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C. To accelerate its emission reductions to be aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, Chile could: Revive discussions on shifting the national coal phase-out date from 2040 to 2030 to mandate the remaining eight coal-fired plants that have not made firm retirement commitments to have a more ambitious retirement date. Decrease economic incentives for fossil fuels. Chile’s carbon tax is considered relatively ineffective due to its low carbon price, while diesel fuel is still subsidised for internal combustion engines (ICE). Implement concrete mitigation measures in the energy end-use, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors so that they can also contribute to emissions reductions leading up to 2030. Rapidly increase the pace of reforestation and sustainable forest management for Chile to meet its LULUCF commitments under its NDC and maintain the sector’s crucial status as a considerable sink. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on increasing its LULUCF sink to meets its climate targets, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance, and should instead prioritise emissions reductions in all other sectors. Since our previous assessment, the positive developments in Chile’s climate policies include: Accelerating the pace of the coal phase-out since its initial announcement in 2019, with the Ministry of Energy announcing its intentions for 70% of coal plants to be retired or retrofitted by 2025. The Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, which aims to address the infrastructure gaps that are hindering EV uptake. Chile has put a large focus on the just transition of the coal phase-out to promote job creation, new investments, and participatory planning in affected communities, including in the Ministry of Energy’s recent Decarbonisation Plan. Explicitly including a link between biodiversity and climate mitigation in its NDC."

Chile,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Chile’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. Chile is almost meeting its “fair share” contributions to climate change mitigation. Chile’s unconditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair share. Chile’s conditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, Chile could strengthen its climate policies and set slightly more ambitious conditional and unconditional NDC targets."
Chile,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"Chile’s current policies are ""Almost sufficient"" when rated against modelled domestic pathways. This rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition. According to our assessment, emissions under Chile’s currently implemented policies would reach between 100–108 MtCO 2 e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels, when emissions peaked). This emissions level is also insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO 2 e). Chile needs to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5° compatible. Since our previous assessment, Chile has continued to shut down coal plants according to its phase-out plan. Over 1.2 GW of coal capacity from eleven plants has been retired since 2019 and an additional nine units have committed to retire or convert to natural gas between 2024 and 2025. Up to five of these units are expected to be retrofitted for gas. While considered a “transition fuel” by the Chilean government, fossil gas is still a fossil fuel that the CAT estimates needs to be completely phased out by 2035 to remain on a global 1.5°C pathway. Therefore, Chile must be careful when repurposing its coal-fired plants to gas, as this could create either a carbon lock-in - or a risk of being left with stranded assets. While there were discussions around bringing forward the coal phase-out year to 2030, it has not been mentioned for some time and recent policy documents reference the 2040 phase-out date. An early coal phase-out, where electricity generation is replaced by renewable sources rather than fossil gas, would significantly impact Chile’s current policies pathway and bring it considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory and be aligned with CAT’s power sector benchmarks. The transport sector makes up a significant share of Chile’s total GHG emissions, especially as its energy consumption continues to increase. The Electromobility Strategy, Energy Efficiency Law, and ban on ICE cars by 2035 are key policies expected to accelerate the low-carbon transportation transition, but Chile’s EV sales have yet to exceed 1%. More should be done to encourage EV uptake and decrease energy demand in the sector, for instance, by reforming diesel fuel subsidies and a modal shift in transportation, so that Chile does not fall behind on its transport electrification targets. Maintaining the LULUCF sink is an important component of Chile’s climate targets which is threatened by the increased frequency and severity of wildfires related to climate change. While Chile has ambitious commitments for reforestation and sustainable forest management in its NDC, the pace of implementation has been far too slow, and stronger policies to support reforestation and forest management are needed. Full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Chile,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions from 2016 values by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways . This rating indicates that Chile’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could improve its 2030 target from 45% to roughly 67% to reach an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO 2 e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it."
Chile,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target – the absolute emissions target of 95 MtCO 2 e excluding LULUCF in 2030 – as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action. This rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. The NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” from our previous update. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al. , 2021) and therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition compared to our previous assessment."
Chile,Land use & forestry,Sink,"Chile has large forested areas, and although emissions have fluctuated strongly, e.g. because major wildfires swept across the country in 2017, Chile’s LULUCF sinks over the last 20 years absorbed, on average, roughly two-thirds of total emissions. Chile should work toward maintaining this LULUCF sink, but it is far from meeting its ambitious reforestation and sustainable forest management commitments in its NDC. For more information about forestry activities in Chile, please see the LULUCF tab under Policies and Actions ."
Chile,Net zero target,Acceptable,"We evaluate Chile’s net zero target as “Acceptable”. Chile’s currently proposed net zero target for 2050 covers most key elements and is now also Legally Binding through the Framework Law. Chile’s target covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses. Chile plans to heavily rely on negative emissions by forests to reach its net zero target, expecting carbon sinks to contribute as much as 50% of the emissions reduction required to reach the 2050 neutrality goal (Gobierno de Chile, 2021). It is therefore extremely important to assure that forests keep acting as sinks and do not turn into emission sources, a risk that can only partly be mitigated by policies, as not only human activity but natural factors, and increasingly the effects of climate change via more extreme and frequent heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, can turn removals from LULUCF to emissions. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits to make this clearer."
Canada,Overview,no rating,"As its forests burn in a record fire season, Canada’s pace of climate action appears to be moving at a glacial speed. So far, the EV sales mandate is the only major new policy from its 2022 climate plan to be implemented. While existing measures are starting to pay off, with emissions now firmly on a downward trend, implementing the full 2022 climate plan is critical to closing the gap between current policies and Canada’s 2030 climate target (NDC). To quote the Environment Commissioner: “we cannot afford a fourth decade of failure on climate action . "" Canada’s overall CAT rating has improved to ‘Insufficient’ due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but additional measures beyond the existing climate plan are needed to move towards an (almost) sufficient rating. Canada’s exported emissions from oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s rating, but are larger than Canada’s domestic emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account. Despite record-breaking wildfires devastating the country, ravaging more than twice the area of the previous largest fires of 1989, Canada seems incapable of kicking its fossil fuel addiction. It approved an offshore oil and gas megaproject in April 2022, continues to support the money-guzzling Trans Mountain pipeline, and exported record amounts of coal in 2023. In many sectors, Canada relies heavily on offsets or uncertain solutions, instead of available proven measures. For its net zero grid as well as its hydrogen strategy, Canada foresees the use of offsets in combination with gas plants with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In aviation, reducing demand or shifting to rail could bring early wins which very low-carbon alternative fuels will not be able to match, while in forestry the afforestation programmes need to be accompanied by robust wildfire prevention measures. Canada’s reclassification of its LULUCF categories early in 2024 has led to a big change in historical LULUCF emissions which now average to a source over the last decade instead of a sink. This change in classification as well as the forest fires and other disturbances, which are not included in Canada’s forestry accounting, highlight the need for significantly more action in this sector if Canada intends to achieve the large sink in 2050 necessary for it to meet its net zero target. Despite the slow progress in passing additional legislation, Canada is clearly working hard at generating the required political consensus to move climate action forward and ensure long-term stability: The new EV sales mandate, targeting 60% of new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be electric by 2030 is a step in the right direction, however for 1.5˚C compatibility, this target should be set at — or close to — 100% by 2030. The carbon pricing scheme, with its steadily increasing price level, is setting clear signals for polluters. A multitude of long-term offtake agreements for clean electricity increase investor security and spur growth in the renewable sector. All eyes will be on additional progress that can be made before the 2025 elections. If the Liberal Party is ousted, Canada risks backtracking on key policy measures and losing many of the recent gains. The Conservative Party has already vowed to scrap the successful carbon pricing scheme which would be a significant step back for Canada. To move firmly forward on climate action Canada could: Ensure that queued policies from the 2022 climate plan are finalised in 2024 , including regulations on clean electricity, methane in the waste and oil and gas sectors, green buildings, a phase-out of coal exports and a cap on oil and gas production. Stop supporting increases in oil and gas production, with a long-term vision to phase out fossil fuel production altogether . Stop enabling coal exports from the US passing through its territory for shipment from Canadian ports. Shift focus from unproven technologies like CCS to proven solutions to build a robust decarbonisation path . Canada risks missing its own climate targets unless these additional measures are implemented quickly."

Canada,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Canada’s climate target, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Canada’s current policies are not enough to achieve this target and are only in line with 3°C warming. Canada is also not meeting its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its targets and policies, needs to provide additional support to others."
Canada,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"Our rating of Canada’s policies and action has improved to “Insufficient”. This improvement is due largely to an improvement in Canada’s policies and action, but also to an update of our modelled domestic pathways to the latest pathways assessed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6). That said, it is still far from 1.5°C compatibility on a global least cost basis. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. If Canada can successfully implement all its planned measures, it would go a long way to closing its ambition gap and its rating would move closer to “Almost sufficient”. The speed and scale of Canada’s climate policy implementation does not match the urgency of the climate crisis and much more work on this front is required. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 603 MtCO 2 e (excl. LULUCF contributions) or 20% below 2005 levels, lower than our last update, due to the impact of the pandemic and continued policy implementation, but a far cry from the 360 MtCO 2 e level needed to be 1.5°C compatible. Since our last update in December 2022, Canada has continued to advance on implementing its carbon pricing increases through to 2030 and adopted some of its outstanding regulations and codes (EV sales mandate, protocols for the GHG offset programme). However, we are still waiting for other promised regulations and strategies (e.g. 2035 net zero grid, implementation of the thermal coal export ban, green buildings, and fertiliser emissions reduction target). The country’s only commercial CCS-abated coal-fired power plant continues to face technical and operational problems and serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive reliance on CCS. For more detail, see the policies and action section here ."
Canada,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"In July 2021, Canada submitted a stronger NDC target. It did not submit a further NDC update since then, contrary to what it agreed to under the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021. Canada will cut emissions by at least 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 30% (incl. LULUCF). While stronger, the target still falls short of the at least 52% below 2005 level (excl. LULUCF) needed to be 1.5°C compatible on a global least cost basis. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient”. Canada is not on track to meet this target under current policies, nor do its planned policies fully close the gap. The CAT’s assessment of Canada’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance."
Canada,NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"From a fair share perspective, we rate Canada’s NDC target as “Insufficient”, meaning it is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Canada needs to strengthen its domestic target and provide additional support for emissions reductions in developing countries to improve on this rating."
Canada,Climate finance,Highly insufficient,"Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient”. The government recently announced a doubling of its climate finance over the next five years. While this is a positive move, Canada retains a poor rating as its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. Canada also continues to provide support to fossil fuel developments abroad. To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance. Canada’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share target rating, and the CAT rates Canada’s overall fair share contribution as “Highly Insufficient”."
Canada,Land use & forestry,Source & Sink,"Land use and forests in Canada are both a significant source and sink of emissions. Net emissions for land use and forests in Canada are consistently a source, according to the latest national inventory. Underlying this are strong emissions from harvested wood products that are not fully balanced by emission removals in managed forests. Both the sources and sinks are independently around 25% of economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF) and we therefore highlight this sector for Canada. If either of the source or sink components change, net emissions will also change and there is potential for land-use and forests to become either a stronger contributor to overall emissions sources or removals."
Canada,Net zero target,Average,"Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, enshrining its 2050 net zero target into law. Canada updated its long-term strategy in November 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO 2 e), which calls into question the credibility of the target. Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and fossil gas in 2050. We evaluate the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as: “Average”. Full details of the assessment are here ."
Brazil,Overview,no rating,"President Lula da Silva, inaugurated in January 2023, has prioritised the reconstruction of Brazil's environmental policy, emphasising low-carbon, socio-economic development. Brazil's forthcoming presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 also shows the country’s strengthened cooperation and re-engagement with the international community. In October 2023, Brazil reverted to its original NDC targets , reflecting a renewed focus on combating deforestation. Initial reports indicate a 36% decrease in primary forest loss in 2023 compared to 2022 due to strengthened law enforcement. Domestically, Brazil has adopted new economy-wide policies to support sustainable development and job creation which highlights the government’s commitment to invest in infrastructure, industry and the transformation of the economy. While these policies include energy transition as one of their main pillars of action, Brazil is yet to have a fixed timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and will continue to allocate significant resources to the production and development of oil and fossil gas in the next decade, which raises concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil's infrastructure agenda. Expanding oil and fossil gas production contradicts the Paris Agreement's target and Brazil’s ambition to lead on climate action ahead of COP30. With this update, Brazil’s overall rating of its climate targets and actions remain rated “Insufficient”. Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 target or its 2030. Brazil’s emissions under current policies (excluding the land use and land use change — or LULUCF — sector) have essentially plateaued, expected to only slightly grow over the rest of the decade. Yet, Brazil needs to peak and rapidly decrease emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C. Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors, including a reversal of present plans to expand the exploitation of fossil fuel energy sources. Recent positive policy developments include: The change in government which is prioritising reconstructing the country’s environmental policy which had suffered from budget cuts and policy rollbacks in the past. The resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, followed by the ongoing process of reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035. Deforestation rates falling in response to political action as recent studies indicate a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels. Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues. The development of new policies such as the Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE) to promote sustainable development while reducing Brazil’s overall environmental footprint, and which includes energy transition as one of its six pillars of action. To improve its climate targets and action rating, Brazil could: Submit a new and significantly more ambitious NDC which clearly outlines the different sectors' contributions to the mitigation target, in particular that of the LULUCF sector. The National Climate Change Policy, currently under development and which will include sectoral mitigation strategies up to 2035, should be aligned with this more ambitious NDC. Submit a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC with a detailed plan to achieve the climate neutrality goal by 2050. This should again provide clarity on the intended role of the LULUCF sector in meeting Brazil’s long-term targets. Develop a comprehensive energy transition policy with a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and a detailed plan for achieving the transition in a just and equitable way. Brazil’s long-term energy plans see an expanded role for fossil gas and oil, with the production of both types of fossil fuel set to increase in the coming decade. This stands in stark contrast with both the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit and Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of COP30. Maintain current hydropower generation alongside increasing wind and solar generation to meet electricity demand growth and to replace the remaining fossil fuel generation, particularly fossil gas. With this, Brazil could put itself among the first countries in the world to reach the 100% clean electricity target by 2030. Strengthen policies to mitigate emissions in the agriculture sector as Brazil’s second-largest contributor to emissions, specifically looking at more sustainable and efficient agriculture methods to increase productivity of currently under-utilised land. Continue to enforce laws to reduce deforestation , especially in the Cerrado region prone to the expansion of the country’s main agricultural frontier, and where deforestation increased by 6% in 2023."

Brazil is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Brazil’s unconditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” and “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share, respectively. Brazil’s conditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To get a better rating Brazil needs to increase its climate target’s ambition and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend."
Brazil,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"Our calculations show Brazil’s total emissions (excluding LULUCF) will reach between 1,162 MtCO 2 e and 1,180 MtCO 2 e in 2030 under current policies. Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 or its 2030 targets. To peak and then rapidly decrease emissions, as required in order to limit warming to 1.5°C, Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors— including a reversal of present plans to expand fossil fuel energy sources. The CAT rates Brazil’s policies and actions as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and actions need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Following the resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, the Inter-ministerial Council on Climate Change began reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035, a process that could take up to two years. Recent studies reported deforestation rates falling in response to political action. A 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels was celebrated as an example of the effects of re-establishing law enforcement in the forestry sector. However, deforestation remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 compared to 2022. Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues, signalling its commitment to shaping international climate policy. This is particularly relevant as 2025 will be the year when countries are mandated to submit updated and more ambitious 2035 climate targets under the Paris Agreement. However, there are important and inconsistent elements in some of the new policy developments, which cast serious doubt on the government's commitment to ecological transformation and transition away from fossil fuels. In particular, Brazil’s new growth acceleration programme —Novo PAC— earmarks important parts of its budget for the production and development of oil and fossil gas industries; as well as the lack of concrete targets for a transition away from fossil fuels in the new Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE).

Brazil,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"While the current NDC is stronger than that submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve Brazil's rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions. We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C."
Brazil,NDC target against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. Brazil reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this target still falls short of being a fair contribution to global climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions."
Brazil,Land use & forestry,Source,"Land use and forestry emissions have been by far the largest source of GHG emissions in Brazil since the early 1990s. Deforestation rates soared in 2019, with over one million hectares cleared in the legal Amazon, a 34% increase from 2018 and a staggering 120% surge from 2012, the historical low. Preventing and combating deforestation stands as the biggest challenge for the Lula administration. The government has launched a new edition of the Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), with a target of zero deforestation by 2030 (also included in the NDC). Early results show a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022. Meeting Brazil’s NDC target will require efforts to halt deforestation to be accompanied by extensive reforestation and restoration of native forests. This can help Brazil to transition towards scenarios where the land use sector not only reduces emissions but also actively removes carbon from the atmosphere."
Brazil,Net zero target,Poor,"Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated to date, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. Brazil has not yet submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: Poor. The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
Bhutan,Overview,no rating,"With Bhutan being a carbon negative country due to its large land sink, it is already compliant with its NDC target of remaining carbon (and GHG) neutral. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary drop in its emissions, we project that Bhutan's emissions will resume increasing over the course of the decade without additional policies. If allowed to increase unchecked, especially in the industry and transport sectors, they could exceed the level that is sequestered by forests. We rate Bhutan as ‘Almost sufficient’ overall. In its second NDC, Bhutan reiterates its carbon neutrality goal, has developed sectoral emission reduction plans for all sectors, and has begun implementing measures on its transport and agriculture sectors. The full implementation of these measures falls within our 1.5°C compatible category for the level of emissions reductions needed within Bhutan’s borders. Bhutan needs international support to fully implement all of these measures. Recent developments include: Construction of the country’s first utility-scale solar plant, which is set to begin in the first half of 2023. The 17 MW plant is part of a broader government initiative to install 300 MW of solar over the next three years. These efforts will help diversify the largely hydropower-based grid and reduce reliance on winter energy imports. Geological uncertainties are delaying operations of under-construction hydro power projects, resulting in an escalation of project costs and mounting national debt. This calls for a diversification towards non-hydro renewable energy. Advancing on its electric vehicle (EV) policies, as the government has started setting up EV charging stations and supporting a shift to EVs in the taxi industry. These actions build on other efforts taken in the transport sector last year to strengthen vehicle emission standards, though some initiatives, like the rapid mass transit system, have not advanced. Expansion of its biogas production. Bhutan will establish a biogas plan as part of a new landfill in its capital city this year. It is promoting domestic biogas production in both its agriculture and waste management sectors. Bhutan has recently embarked on a strategy to develop its industrial parks and emissions are expected to grow significantly in this sector. The government has identified a number of mitigation measures it could take, with support, in its low-emissions industry strategy, but we could not find any evidence that it has begun to implement these."
Bhutan,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Bhutan’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s climate commitments and policies are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, but could be with moderate improvements. This rating is based on a modification of the CAT’s standard approach to reflect the fact that Bhutan is already carbon neutral and to provide a more accurate picture of Bhutan’s emissions trajectory and actions. Details are provided under the targets page . Bhutan is close to a 1.5°C compatible rating, but would need to slow its emissions growth to achieve this rating. Bhutan will need international support to fully implement its policies and action."
Bhutan,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"We rate Bhutan’s current policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Bhutan’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond Bhutan’s fair share if the needed international support is provided. Bhutan’s economy-wide emissions dropped by around 40% between 2019-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic-induced slowing down of economic activity. We project that emissions will resume increasing over the course of the decade, reaching around 2.8-3.0 MtCO 2 e/year in 2030 - an increase of 76-85% from 2010 level. Bhutan has developed sectoral low-emission development plans, but the exact status of implementation of these plans can be difficult to determine. Bhutan is expanding its solar capacity to diversify its power generation. Electrification of the transport sector with increasing number of electric taxis and private vehicle is part of government plan along with expansion of charging infrastructure. In 2019, Bhutan adopted its Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap. Mitigation potential for some of these measures is included in our assessment of current policies and action. Other sectoral policy actions include forest conservation and management under the National REDD+ Strategy. Bhutan will remain compliant with its NDC target of staying carbon (and GHG) neutral with currently implemented policies."
Bhutan,CAT estimate against modelled domestic pathways,1.5°C global least cost,"As Bhutan has already achieved its carbon neutral NDC target, rating this NDC target level (excluding the contribution of the forestry sector) based on the current net emissions produces misleading results, thus we have adopted an alternative method. We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures from NDC are fully implemented against where its emissions would need to be based on a global least cost modelled domestic pathway for 1.5°C. The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C."
Bhutan,CAT estimate against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory (not current policies) against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. Our rating is based on the top end of this range and is ""Almost sufficient"". The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Bhutan's approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Bhutan has the potential to achieve a 1.5°C compatible rating if it manages to slow its emissions growth."
Bhutan,Land use & forestry,Sink,"In 2020, Bhutan had a net carbon sink capacity of 8.9 MtCO 2 e which is pivotal for its carbon neutrality pledge. Bhutan implemented the REDD+ readiness programme and produced Bhutan’s National REDD+ Strategy and implementation framework. Forests currently cover 70% of Bhutan’s land, and it has a constitutional mandate to maintain this share above 60%."
Bhutan,Net zero target,Information incomplete,"Bhutan first committed to remaining carbon neutral during COP15, in Copenhagen in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 goal, which is essentially an extension of its carbon neutrality target and which it has already achieved. Bhutan is currently developing its long-term strategy which will be important to develop sectoral policies particularly for the energy and industry sector to curb the emissions. Until that strategy is released, we classify Bhutan’s net zero target as “information incomplete”."
Australia,Overview,no rating,"The Australian government is continuing its long-standing support for fossil fuels both at home and abroad, despite promising new investments into clean energy. Emissions from the fossil fuel, industry, agriculture and waste sectors continue to flatline, as the government's ongoing reliance on - and revision of - its land sector for emission removals gives the appearance of action where there has been little. The government has introduced several measures aimed at stimulating investment in large-scale renewable energy, green hydrogen production and clean manufacturing, and improvements to vehicle efficiency. However, in parallel, the government has doubled down on fossil fuels, embedding their role in Australia’s domestic energy consumption and exports for decades to come. Australia’s rating remains “Insufficient” and its 2030 NDC target of 43% is not aligned with 1.5°C and needs to be significantly improved to do so. Since 2018, the government has repeatedly revised its land sector sequestration projections, creating the illusion of action. For example, by 2024 Australia had achieved net emission reductions of 28% below 2005 levels - including LULUCF – but without LULUCF, emissions had dropped by only 2%. This continued revision of Australia’s historical and projected LULUCF estimates erodes the ambition of its NDC for fossil fuel and industrial emissions, the main drivers of climate change, and where the government holds the most leverage. Australia’s updated NDC, submitted in 2022, has an emissions reduction target of 43% below 2005 levels by 2030. By 2023, the land sector revisions would have generated a reduction of 38.5% in net emissions reductions below 2005; in 2024 the updated LULUCF inventory generates a 41% net reduction. The government’s approval of seven new coal mine projects in 2023 and 2024 will allow coal mining and exports to continue for many decades to come. This is incompatible with the Paris Agreement’s goals, and with the government’s own emission reduction commitments. The government also continues to support the oil and gas industry, reaffirming its support for production and export of fossil gas until 2050 and beyond, with the release of its Future Gas Strategy. The government’s support of the fossil fuel industry hinges on false solutions such as its support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and offsets. According to the IEA, no new fossil fuel projects are required in its Net Zero Emissions scenario, which reaches net zero emissions by mid-century in a way that limits global warming to 1.5°C, consistent with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. While the government’s expanded Capacity Investment Scheme demonstrates its commitment to its 82% renewable electricity target for 2030, many barriers to renewable energy projects remain. Investment in large-scale renewable energy was down significantly in 2023 compared to 2022. The government still lacks federal-level plans and committed timelines for coal and fossil gas phase-out. The government introduced several new policies in the industry and transport sectors in 2024. The Future Made in Australia plan, the country’s “response to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act”, commits AUD 22.7bn (USD 14.9bn) over 10 years to boosting renewable hydrogen, green metals, low carbon liquid fuels, critical minerals processing, and clean energy manufacturing including battery and solar panel supply chains. The updated National Hydrogen Strategy specifically focuses on renewable-based hydrogen production, rather than fossil fuel-derived hydrogen. The government’s long-awaited New Vehicle Efficiency Standard was also introduced in 2024. Australia was, along with Russia, among the few developed economies to lack such measures. Rollout of electric vehicles in Australia lags behind most OECD countries, and holistic transport policies, which consider public transport, freight, and modal shift, are still missing. Australia’s policy gap for agricultural, buildings and waste sectors also remain: these sectors will be key to align with the 2050 net zero goal. Australia will need to adopt more ambitious climate policies and take further action to reach 1.5ºC Paris Agreement compatibility. Time is running out in the crucial period to 2030. To improve its climate action, Australia could: Decrease its reliance on offsetting and LULUCF emissions by implementing ambitious policies to provide a sufficient level of transparency and certainty of impact, without depending on domestic carbon sequestration or international offsets. Australia not only needs to submit a 2035 1.5°C compatible NDC in 2025 but must also set targets for genuine emissions reduction from its economy without relying on highly uncertain estimates from land sector. It should also introduce full transparency with respect to its land sector modelling and revision. Stop supporting the fossil fuel industry , by ceasing its financial and administrative support for coal and gas projects, stopping new developments, and establishing a framework to shift away from fossil fuel exports. Accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel power generation by streamlining regulatory approvals that are slowing investment in large-scale renewable generation and storage, incentivising demand-side management, and planning the phasing out of coal and gas-fired plants, including off-grid, in a fair and just way. Foster the decarbonisation of the transportation sector through the implementation of policies for accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles, public transport planning, incentives for modal shift, and transition pathways for heavy mobility. Address emissions from the agriculture, waste and stationary energy sectors , with targeted policies that guarantee a fair and just transition. Transition Australia’s industry to future-oriented, low-carbon exports , by exploiting its vast renewables potential and mineral resources, without backing false solutions such as offsets and carbon capture and storage. Some positive developments are worth highlighting: Australia’s AUD 22.7bn (USD 14.9bn) Future Made in Australia plan sets out a vision for Australia to capitalise on its substantial renewable energy and critical mineral resources and to attract investment in clean industries. If successfully implemented, the plan could provide a pathway out of reliance on coal and gas exports. Australia’s States and Territories continue to lead the way on climate action, with all except for Western Australia and the Northern Territory having a more ambitious 2030 target than the Federal government or having a 2035/2040 target already in place."
Australia,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance, and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Australia,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Australia’s climate targets, policies and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To improve its rating, Australia needs to set a more ambitious 2030 target for emissions reductions, establish policies to reach its objectives, and provide finance to support others."
Australia,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"The government has yet to take the necessary steps to put the country on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C below pre-industrial levels. The government’s current policies are on track to reduce Australia’s total emissions excluding LULUCF 17–21% below 2005 levels by 2030. The government is relying heavily on a LULUCF sink to reach its climate goals, with LULUCF historical and projected sequestration revised significantly upwards in recent years. The Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), expanded in late 2023, aims to deliver 32 GW of new clean energy capacity by 2030, comprised of 23 GW of variable renewable capacity and 9 GW of dispatchable capacity, such as battery storage, in support of the government’s 82% renewable electricity target. While it is too early to assess the impact of the expanded CIS, progress towards the 82% target is lagging and coal still accounts for nearly half of all generation in Australia. Other promising developments in 2024 include the introduction of the AUD 22.7bn (USD 14.9bn) Future Made in Australia plan, the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, and an updated National Hydrogen Strategy. The Safeguard Mechanism (SGM), reformed in 2023, is the government’s main policy for reducing industrial emissions. It is too early to assess the impact of the reforms because of the SGM design, however it is already clear that SGM facilities are relying significantly on offsets in place of making direct on-site emissions reduction. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Australia,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Australia’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. Australia’s NDC targets emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. However, this target is dependent on LULUCF sequestration estimates, which fluctuate widely year on year. Excluding LULUCF, this target equates to a reduction of 20% below 2005 levels by 2030. Projections for LULUCF sequestration in 2030 increased nearly fourfold between the government’s 2021 and 2023 projections. This reduces the emissions reduction task for energy, industry, agriculture and waste. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Australia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C."
Australia,NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Australia’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. Australia’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Australia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Australia needs to improve its fair share contribution through both strengthened domestic emissions reductions as well as financing additional climate action in developing countries."
Australia,Climate finance,Critically insufficient,"The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s climate finance contributions to date are low and not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. At COP28, Australia pledged to stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad within a year. Although the international fossil fuel financing rating improved from “Highly Insufficient” to “Insufficient”, Australia’s overall climate finance rating remained unchanged. To receive a better rating, Australia must increase the level of its international climate finance."
Australia,Land use & forestry,Source,"Australia’s maximum land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) net emissions in the last 30 years are greater than 30% of total emissions. The government intends to meet its NDC and net zero target by relying on LULUCF as a carbon sink (see section Forestry in the Policies and actions tab). The government regularly recalculates LULUCF for historical and projected emissions. The extent of these recalculations highlights the uncertainty of this sector: data changes have significant repercussions on Australia’s progress in meeting emissions targets. Continued revision of Australia’s historical and projected LULUCF estimates erodes the ambition of its NDC for fossil fuel and industrial emissions, the main drivers of climate change, and where the government holds the most leverage. Effective climate policies are needed to decarbonise all sectors in line with the 1.5°C temperature limit irrespective of projected LULUCF sequestration, which is inherently uncertain."
Australia,Net zero target,Poor,"We evaluate the net zero target as “Poor”. An updated Net Zero Plan is under development by the government but is yet to be published. Australia’s current long-term emissions reduction plan, also submitted to the UNFCCC as a Long-Term Strategy (LTS), was published in 2021. The LTS sets a net zero emissions target for 2050. Yet the strategy presents scenarios which only reduces emissions by 60% below 2005 excluding LULUCF. It does not introduce any new policies, and relies on global technology trends, carbon offsets and further unknown technology “breakthroughs”. There are also no plans in the document to phase out coal, curb fossil fuel exports, nor to hold heavy polluters accountable. The government legislated its net zero and 2030 targets in September 2022. It is still possible for Australia to get emissions onto a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5℃ this century, but urgent action is required. The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
Argentina,Overview,no rating,"Under Argentina’s new government, progress in developing and implementing climate policies has taken a step backwards. Among the restructuring and budget cuts in the national public administration, Argentina’s former Ministry of Environment has been demoted to the sub-secretary level, and the continuity of its previous climate policies remains in doubt. Meanwhile, the government continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, notably a USD 30 billion LNG terminal to export fossil gas out of Vaca Muerta. Overall, CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. Under President Milei’s administration which assumed office in December 2023, Argentina’s national government has been substantially restructured, with a focus on reducing the size of the public administration and cutting expenditure. In this process, the former Ministry of Environment has been reduced to the sub-secretary level, under the Secretary of Sport, Tourism and Environment (EcoNews Global, 2023). During his presidential campaign, President Milei had stated he does not believe in man-made climate change and that his government will not support climate policies, including threats to leave the Paris Agreement (Colombo, 2023). While his administration later stated that Argentina will not be leaving the Paris Agreement, during COP29, Argentina recalled its delegation only a few days into the negotiations. Overall the outlook is bleak on Argentine increasing climate ambition for the next four years (Larena, 2024; Spring, 2023). The new government plans to continue developing the Vaca Muerta fossil gas fields, as well as a fossil gas pipeline and the LNG terminal planned by the previous administration. To support these large investments, the government set out an incentive package called RIGI or Incentive Regime for Large Investments (KPMG, 2024). In 2022, emissions in Argentina rebounded above 2019 levels after a sharp drop in 2020 due to COVID-19. This puts Argentina’s 2030 emissions projections under current policies at approximately 15% above its already unambitious 2030 target. Based on a study by UNICEN exploring energy scenarios (Blanco & Keesler, 2022), if Argentina were to implement additional policies to scale-up low carbon energy sources and reduce energy demand, it could get close to its NDC target. However, to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, Argentina would need to develop more ambitious policies, especially to stop deforestation and reduce livestock-related emissions. Argentina submitted an updated NDC in December 2021 that sets an unconditional target that is only a marginal improvement on the previous iteration. Argentina’s latest target only achieves a “Highly insufficient” rating when compared to required domestic efforts, and to Argentina’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation. With emissions (excl. LULUCF) projected to grow significantly after 2022, Argentina is set to miss its NDC target. In the last few months, climate policy has been significantly deprioritised in Argentina. However, there have been some positive developments: After denying climate change and claiming Argentina would exit the Paris Agreement, the Milei administration promised to keep all existing international climate commitments , including both the NDC and long-term strategy (LTS) targets. Subsidies for power and fossil gas have continued to progressively decrease , including plans to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups of the population. However, it is unclear how successful those plans are in protecting these groups. New measures were introduced to reform the power market , in an effort to increase competition and private sector investment. There is much that Argentina could do to increase its climate ambition, including: Re-committing to its existing domestic climate policies and make resources available for their implementation. Phasing out support for upstream oil and fossil gas developments. Setting out a transition plan for the energy sector and revive existing renewables policies such as the RenovAr auction scheme. Setting out a low-carbon transition plan for the land sector, including agriculture, livestock and land use change."

Argentina,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Argentina’s climate targets and policies together as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Argentina is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Argentina’s NDC and policies and action are rated as “critically Insufficient” when compared to our modelled domestic pathways. Argentina’s conditional NDC is rated as “Highly Insufficient” compared to our modelled domestic pathways. To achieve its NDC target, Argentina would need to enhance its current policies which at the moment lead to over 4°C of warming by the end of the century. To get a better rating Argentina would need to set more ambitious climate targets and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend."
Argentina,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"We rate Argentina’s policies and actions as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Argentina’s climate policies reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Argentina’s policies and action rating compared to modelled domestic pathways is now worse than in our previous assessment due to an update in our current policy projections for the agriculture sector. Our latest projections expect higher growth in agricultural and livestock production, leading to higher emissions by 2030. During the second half of 2023 the previous Argentinian government came out with three strategic climate policies: the National Strategy for International Climate Financing 2023, the National Strategy for the Use of Carbon Markets 2023 and the National Strategy for Sustainable Finance, 2023 (ENFS) (Banco Central de la República Argentina, 2023; Government of Argentina, 2023e; MECON, 2023). However, these are so far only high-level documents meant to structure future work on designing climate finance roadmaps and possibly a cap-and-trade system in the Argentinian power and industry sectors. It is unclear how - or whether - the Milei administration will design and implement these policies. In December 2022, Argentina published its latest National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. The strategy includes climate measures and targets covering all major sectors, including targets for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, incentives to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and measures to reduce food loss and food waste. This strategy, however, does not include any new renewable energy targets, nor any significant measures to reduce emissions from the land sector, especially those linked to livestock.

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century."

The improvement in Argentina’s NDC target rating against fair share since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021). It therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment."
Argentina,Land use & forestry,Source,"Argentina’s average share of emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) over the past 20 years is more than 20% of the country’s total emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, however, emissions from LULUCF started falling up to as low as to 3% of total emissions, to bounce back to 22% in 2020. This indicates that Argentina’s recent approach to curbing land use emissions may have been working, and would need to be maintained, updated, and reinforced. For more information about forestry activities in Argentina, please see the policies and action section ."
Argentina,Net zero target,Poor,"We evaluate the net zero target as: Poor. In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology . The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government has failed to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals."
Rating system,Overview,no rating,"The CAT’s rating method evaluates a broad spectrum of government targets and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement temperature limit. For each country, we develop: The overall rating: the combination of all the ratings generates an overall rating for the country Rating the policies and action : are governments putting in place real policies and action in line with global least-cost mitigation pathways or fair share principles? Rating the “ domestic target ” or the “ internationally supported target ”: are government promises for targets in their country ambitious with respect to global least-cost mitigation pathways, acknowledging that most developing countries will need support to achieve this level? Rating the “ fair share target ”: is a country doing its fair share? We assess whether government promises for action in their country with their own resources and, if relevant, the financing of action abroad represent a fair contribution to global efforts. Climate finance : for those countries where relevant, we assess whether governments are providing sufficient support for mitigation actions in other countries. The CAT also evaluates a government’s net zero targets where possible, and flags whether greenhouse gas emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry have a high impact on overall emissions. Governments should commit to reducing their own emissions and follow through on those commitments by implementing policies that reduce emissions to meet those targets. These actions in a country can be assessed against what is technically and economically feasible, usually a globally cost-efficient perspective. However, for many countries, what is feasible either falls short of what would be expected of them based on principles of fairness, or is beyond what is possible with domestic resources alone. Fair share principles mean that developed country governments need to support developing countries in achieving the global mitigation goals. Our new assessment framework therefore combines both fair share and cost-efficient mitigation perspectives to assess the different components of government targets and actions. With this framework we identify whether: Government promises for targets and action in its country are ambitious with respect to global least-cost mitigation pathways, acknowledging that most developing countries will need support to achieve this level Government promises for action in its country with its own resources and, if relevant, the financing of action abroad represent a fair contribution to global efforts Developed country governments are providing sufficient support to developing countries OR developing countries are making plans to use support provided by developed countries Governments are putting in place real policies and action in line with global least-cost mitigation pathways or fair share principles and are on track to meeting their promises. CAT uses five rating categories for its overall rating and the different elements: The “1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible” rating indicates that a country’s climate policies and commitments are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that a country’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that a country’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that a country’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. For many countries in this category, policies and commitments lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that a country’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement. For the individual rating of targets and action against modelled domestic pathways and the fair share contribution, the categories can be associated with estimates for global warming: If all countries followed the rated country’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C for the “Almost sufficient” category. For the “Insufficient” category, the range is 2°C to 3°C, for the “Highly Insufficient” 3°C to 4°C, and for “Critically insufficient” above 4°C. Given that the overall rating is an aggregate of different elements, we do not provide a warming range for it. The CAT focuses its rating on mitigation efforts but recognises that adaptation, and support for adaptation and loss and damage are also vital in meeting the Paris Agreement View the rating method in detail View all countries & sectors"
Indonesia,Overview,no rating,"NOTE: We will update our quantitative assessment of Indonesia’s current policy projections and targets in 2025. This update will incorporate an assessment of key policy documents—such as the National Energy Policy (KEN), National Energy General Plan (RUEN), National Electricity Master Plan (RUKN), Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL), and the Second NDC— all of which are under development by the government and expected to be published in 2025. This current update is a qualitative assessment of recent climate policy developments. Indonesia's climate policy presents a complex and contradictory picture, marked by a clear tension between the country's gradual efforts to promote renewable energy, its continued reliance on fossil fuels, and significant emissions from deforestation. Overall, Indonesia's progress in transitioning to a low-carbon economy remains limited, with little meaningful change across critical sectors. Power generation and industry remain heavily reliant on coal, while demand for palm oil continues to be the primary driver of widespread deforestation and land use sector emissions. Indonesia's overall rating remains ""Critically insufficient."" The current NDC (2022) and the draft 2035 NDC (2024) both present unambitious emission reduction targets as Indonesia can already meet both under existing policies (without the need for additional, more ambitious policies), and the NDCs fail to address the increase in emissions caused by off-grid coal-fired electricity. If kept as is, the draft 2035 NDC would represent a missed opportunity for Indonesia to increase its climate action and set realistically achievable and actually ambitious targets that are aligned with the 1.5˚C warming limit of the Paris Agreement. Under the newly-inaugurated administration of President Prabowo Subianto in October 2024, Indonesia stands at a critical juncture in its climate and energy policies. Some plans developed under the new government's focus on sustaining economic development and enhancing self-sufficiency, particularly through initiatives like the food estate programme that aims to reduce reliance on food imports, raise significant environmental concerns, including potential deforestation, biodiversity loss, and displacement of indigenous communities. In November 2024, the President made ambitious announcements at various high-level international forums about the country's energy transition, pledging to retire all fossil fuel and coal-powered plants within 15 years and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050, a decade earlier than previously indicated. While these announcements signal a positive shift in the country’s energy and climate commitments, the complexity of Indonesia’s power sector and the existing policy and regulatory framework present structural barriers to implementing these pledges quickly. The President’s leadership in reforming the regulatory framework and aligning policies is a prerequisite to achieving these targets. The November 2022 Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Joint Statement between Indonesia and the International Partners Group (IPG) marked a milestone in international climate cooperation. The partnership aims to increase renewables to 44% of the on-grid power mix by 2030 (from 15% in 2023) and reach net-zero on-grid emissions by 2050 through: 1) early retirement and managed phase-out of coal plants and 2) supporting the upscaling of renewable power. However, several concerns about the overall targets and plans outlined in the 2023 Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) have emerged, mainly due to target misalignment with the 1.5°C pathway, insufficient funding, and a lack of just transition plans for impacted communities. Indonesia's emissions from land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF), also known as forestry and other land use (FOLU), have accounted for nearly half of the country's total emissions over the past 20 years, reaching around 1 GtCO 2 e per year, with palm oil-driven deforestation the biggest cause. Indonesia aims to reach a net negative 140 MtCO 2 e in GHG emissions by 2030 under its FOLU Net Sink programme. However, given current LULUCF emission trends and policy projections estimating an increase in emissions of around 920 MtCO 2 e per year in 2030, it is uncertain how Indonesia will achieve such steep reductions within this short timeframe. In August 2024, Indonesia released a draft of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (SNDC) for public consultation, which includes updated 2030 targets and new 2035 climate goals. The draft unconditional target reflects minimal climate action, while the conditional pathways are misaligned with the CAT’s global least-cost 1.5°C pathway. These conditional pathways rely heavily on delaying significant action until emissions peak in 2035, followed by steep reductions to reach net zero by 2060—an approach that lacks credibility given the inadequate current policies in place and poses a substantial risk of not being achieved without disruptive policy measures, substantial international support, and favourable external factors. For further reading on the preliminary analysis of Indonesia's new climate goals, see our blog . Indonesia's current policies lead to a strong increase in emissions towards 2030 and do not yet put it on a low-carbon trajectory that uses its vast renewable energy potential. Key measures needed for strengthening Indonesia’s climate action and substantiating the President’s recent ambitious announcements include: Aligning energy transition targets and implementation with the Paris Agreement: align JETP targets with the 1.5°C pathway, which, based on CAT’s Paris-aligned benchmarks for the power sector , requires Indonesia to generate at least 55%—and ideally up to 82%—of its energy from renewables by 2030. This calls for expediting the passage of the New and Renewable Energy Bill and establishing a supportive regulatory environment by implementing policies that lower barriers to renewable investment, such as improving the existing renewable energy procurement processes and power purchase agreements within the state-owned electricity company (PLN: Perusahaan Listrik Negara ), amending coal-favouring policies, and reforming fossil fuel subsidies in a just and equitable manner. Strengthening forest protection and governance to promote sustainable land use management: enhance safeguards against deforestation by upgrading the Presidential Instruction No. 5 of 2019—which imposes a permanent moratorium on deforestation in primary forests and peatlands exploitation—to a legally binding law or presidential regulation for stronger enforcement, while expanding these protections to cover designated concession areas and secondary forests. In addition, improve the robustness of Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification to minimise the impact of biofuels development on deforestation and biodiversity, especially in light of the upcoming plans to increase the biodiesel blend from 35% (B35) to 40-50% (B40-B50). Evaluating environmentally harmful development programmes: conduct thorough assessments of mega-projects like the food estate programme (aimed at reducing food imports), and the relocation of the capital from Jakarta to Nusantara in Kalimantan, to prevent environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and displacement of indigenous communities. Ensure compliance with laws that protect indigenous land rights and explore sustainable alternatives that promote food security without harming ecosystems, e.g. through nutritious crop diversification, food distribution improvement, and investment in sustainable practices. Ensuring a just transition by developing operational plans and securing international support: develop clear plans to operationalise the just transition framework and allocate sufficient funds to support affected workers and communities during the coal phase-out, by prioritising reskilling, providing social protection packages, and pushing for economic diversification measures away from coal exports. This can be supported by actively engaging with international partners to secure financial and technical support through mechanisms like JETP. Despite the uncertain outlook and mixed progress in the development of policies and targets, there have been several positive developments worth highlighting: JETP CIPP 2024 updates featuring new investment focus areas and promising progress: the JETP Secretariat is preparing the 2024 Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP), which will include new investment focus areas in energy efficiency and electrification, while integrating the once-overlooked off-grid coal emissions into the technical modelling. The updated CIPP will also highlight advances in financing progress, project approvals, and forthcoming policy reforms. Green affordable housing and energy efficiency mandates: through the Indonesia Green Affordable Housing Program (IGAHP), Indonesia aims to build and retrofit one million green housing units by 2030, with a potential emissions reduction of 19-36 MtCO 2 , and achieve net-zero housing by 2050. With the residential sector making up around 80% of building energy demand, this initiative could play a crucial role in lowering emissions as the country’s middle class continue to grow. A 2023 government regulation also mandates energy efficiency in public buildings and for large energy consumers, reinforcing efforts in reducing buildings sector emissions. Public transit electrification and expansion : efforts to extend the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit (LRT), and KRL Commuter Line networks are underway in greater Jakarta, with an LRT system also being considered for Bali—a positive step towards improving the currently limited public transit coverage in Indonesian cities. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network is expanding to six pilot cities, with TransJakarta (BRT operator in Jakarta), leading the way by committing to fully electrify its 10,000 bus fleet by 2030, promoting low-carbon public transportation and improving urban air quality. Indonesia must urgently reconcile its economic development ambitions with the pressing need to reduce emissions and protect its forests and biodiversity. By adopting stronger climate policies and targets, leveraging international support, and committing to a just transition, Indonesia can work towards aligning its climate action with the Paris Agreement and make a significant contribution to global climate mitigation efforts. See our Policies and action section for more information."
Indonesia,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Indonesia,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Indonesia’s climate targets and policies “Critically Insufficient”. which indicates that Indonesia’s climate policies and commitments currently reflect minimal action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Under Indonesia’s current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. Indonesia is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Indonesia’s unconditional and policies and action are rated as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share, respectively. Indonesia’s conditional NDC is rated as “Critically Insufficient” considering modelled domestic pathways. As a country with lower responsibility, capability, and per-capita emissions, Indonesia should receive international support to set an ambitious conditional NDC target beyond its national fair share and implement the policies necessary to achieve it."
Indonesia,Policies and action  against fair share,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Indonesia’s policies and actions “Critically Insufficient” when compared to their fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. The “Critically Insufficient” rating indicates that Indonesia’s climate policies and action reflect minimal action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. In our 2023 assessment, current policy projections increased by around 300 MtCO 2 e in 2030 compared to the previous 2022 assessment, driven by a huge increase in 2022 emissions and quantification of emissions from Indonesia’s off-grid coal power pipeline. This figure remains unchanged in this update, as we made no quantitative adjustments in this round. The JETP enhances ambition beyond national plans, but still fails to put Indonesia on a Paris-compatible decarbonisation pathway. To be 1.5°C compatible, Indonesia needs to generate at least 55% of its power from renewables and up to 80% by 2030, for which Indonesia will need significant financial support to reach these levels. Indonesia’s ETS and the forthcoming carbon tax are promising developments that can help drive its energy transition if implemented well. The Indonesia Carbon Exchange (IDXCarbon) was officially launched in 2023, supporting the expansion of Indonesia’s ETS to cover 99 coal plants in 2023, and up to 146 coal plants in the first quarter of 2024. There have been some improvements to the regulatory environment for renewables (reform of tariff structure in Presidential Regulation No. 112 of 2022) but policies to support low-carbon development in Indonesia need strengthening to realise their full mitigation potential and to see the global drop in prices for renewable technologies reflected in generation costs (local content requirements, contract terms, and coal price cap). The full policies and action analysis can be found here."
Indonesia,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"We rate Indonesia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Indonesia’s internationally supported target in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C temperature. If all countries were to follow Indonesia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. The CAT’s assessment of Indonesia’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance."
Indonesia,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Critically insufficient,"We rate Indonesia’s unconditional target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation. This rating indicates that Indonesia’s fair share target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Indonesia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C."
Indonesia,Land use & forestry,Source,"Indonesia’s emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry have accounted for almost half of the country’s total emissions over the last 20 years. Indonesia has improved efforts in this sector and managed to continue the decreasing trend of annual tree cover loss in the last five years. Reducing emissions from deforestation is a vital part of Indonesia’s climate action."
Indonesia,Net zero target,Information incomplete,The CAT does not yet evaluate Indonesia’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information . Indonesia has not yet communicated an explicit net zero target but explores scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2060 or sooner in its long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021.
India,Overview,no rating,"India is experiencing rapid growth in energy demand driven by GDP growth essential for a developing economy and increased demand for cooling amid heatwaves. Despite achieving substantial progress in installing renewable energy capacity and continuous decline in its tariff, India’s fossil fuel demand remains unchanged. Indeed, coal production and imports reached a record high in the first half of 2024 to meet the rise in seasonal electricity demand brought on by another year of record summer heat. This could be mitigated with faster rollout of renewables plus storage both of which are cost-effective compared to fossil fuels in India. Continued expansion of coal-fired power is not aligned with 1.5°C target of Paris Agreement . Since our last update no major new policy has been implemented in India, due to the general election that concluded at the end of May 2024, with the new government taking office in June 2024. The CAT’s overall rating of India’s climate targets and action remains “Highly insufficient”. There has been a steady increase in the deployment of renewable energy in the country, including both utility-scale and rooftop solar, resulting in coal's share of the capacity mix dropping to a historic low. Currently, non-fossil energy sources account for 46% of India's total installed capacity, indicating that the country is well on track to achieve its conditional NDC target of 50% non-fossil capacity ahead of schedule. This progress suggests that a more ambitious NDC target could be set. The Indian government has implemented several policy measures to encourage renewable energy installation and generation, including economic benefits in terms of subsidies, improvements to administrative processes, and incentives for the domestic production of solar technologies. Solar and wind tariffs are the lowest-cost electricity in India, and solar energy with storage is becoming cost competitive compared to fossil fuels. The falling cost renewables in India could be instrumental in undermining the coal and gas power. A lower tariff of solar could also be supportive of production and utilisation of green hydrogen, which is getting emphasis by the government. However, reliance on coal power continues to be a drag on ambition. Although overall coal capacity has declined below 50%, to be aligned with 1.5oC temperature limit coal generation to reach at 17-19% by 2030. India has been witnessing a surge in summer electricity demand in recent years due to extreme heatwaves. As a result, the increase in renewable energy capacity is barely able to keep up with the increase in demand and generation share of coal remains above 70%. Another challenge is meeting the peak demand during non-solar hours which requires more robust grid infrastructure and storage. According to National Electricity Plan, India will need around 74GW of storage to meet peak demand in 2031-32, yet current storage capacity stands at just 4GW. To meet the immediate summer energy demand, the government has directed coal plants to operate at maximum capacity and to increase the blending share of imported coal. The utilisation of gas plants has also increased over the past year to meet peak demand. However, it's important to note that solar power with storage is becoming increasingly competitive with coal tariffs, raising questions about the economic viability of coal in the short to mid-term. Both domestic coal production and coal imports have reached record highs in 2024. This is further highlighted by the government’s ambitious coal mining plans and policy to continue subsidy and tax incentives for domestic and imported coal. While renewable energy sources do receive subsidies, the total subsidies in various forms for coal and other fossil fuels are eight times higher than those allocated to renewables. Long term planning is a necessity for India to deal with the challenge it faces in balancing its long-term renewable energy goals with the short-term necessity to meet growing energy demands, which is exacerbated by extreme weather conditions. India’s situation underscores the complexity of transitioning to sustainable energy systems in the face of rising and fluctuating energy needs. International support is crucial for India to access advanced technologies, financial resources, and best practices that can accelerate its transition to a sustainable energy future. Our analysis shows that with current policies, India will overachieve its conditional NDC targets of achieving 50% non-fossil capacity by 2030, so it could set stronger targets. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has begun his third term in office, marking a new tenure for the Indian government. This continuity in leadership is expected to sustain policy consistency in India's renewable energy sector and maintain momentum. While it is expected that renewable energy policies will continue to be a focus, India faces a climate policy risk in maintaining and expanding its thermal power sector and domestic coal production, potentially retaining the status quo, and delaying a coal phase-out. Some of the recent positive developments in terms of climate change mitigation policies include: With the significant ramp-up of renewable energy, for the first time ever the country’s coal capacity has fallen below 50% of total capacity. A more than 83% increase in investments in renewable energy projects has been observed in 2023-24. The government has started viability gap funding (VGF) of around USD 893m for offshore wind energy projects. Solar PV with storage is becoming cost competitive as solar with storage projects are putting in bids closer to the current solar tariff. Energy demand in India will continue to rise for the coming two to three decades to meet its developmental needs and to support increasing cooling demand. To exit this spiral of ever-increasing fossil fuel demand and to achieve a sustainable energy transition India could: Expedite the policy and technical support to increase grid integration of renewable energy and storage capacity, to ensure seasonal peaks in demand can be met safely. Avoid locking in a dependency on fossil fuel imports and set up a plan for early retirement of existing thermal capacity. Launch programmes targeted at low carbon and sustainable cooling methods, particularly in urban centres. Adopt an ambitious conditional target to indicate what it would be willing to do if support were made available."
India,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

India,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates India’s climate targets and policies as “Highly Insufficient”, indicating that India’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. India’s second NDC of 2022 strengthened its targets on paper, but will not drive real world emission reductions beyond its current level of climate action. Its emissions intensity target is “Insufficient” when compared to India’s fair share contribution. India’s 50% non-fossil capacity target by 2030, which is conditional on international support, is “Highly insufficient” when compared to a modelled 1.5°C emissions pathway for the country and its current power sector plans already exceed this target. India needs to adopt stronger targets that will drive actual emissions reductions and accelerate climate policy implementation. The country will need international support to get onto a 1.5°C pathway."
India,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate India’s current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. India has ambitious renewable energy plans as outlined in the National Electricity Plan 2023 (NEP2023) aiming for a share of installed capacity of 57% and 66% in 2026-27 and 2031-32, respectively. Share of renewable energy capacity in India reached 44%, ranked fourth in the world in renewable energy capacity installations in 2023, after China, the US and Germany. The NEP2023 is reflected in the lower bound of our current policy and action pathway. India has seen a steady increase in renewable energy deployment, including both utility-scale and rooftop solar, leading to the share of coal capacity dropping below 50% for the first time. However, this increase in renewable energy capacity is barely able to keep up with the surging demand. As a result, the electricity generation share of renewable energy, including large hydro, remains at around 18%, showing no improvement since last year. Investment in renewable energy projects in India are projected to increase by over 83% to around USD 16.5 bn in 2024, with fossil fuel companies also diversifying their investments into the renewable sector. Despite this, India has not committed to phasing out coal power or fossil gas. The National Electricity Plan indicated a temporary halt in coal capacity addition, but current under-construction capacity exceeds the threshold stated in these plans. While new gas power projects have been abandoned, the utilisation of existing gas power plants has increased to meet energy demand driven by severe heat stress. The government continues to advance its green hydrogen policy with its updated National Green Hydrogen Mission, an important step forward for decarbonisation of refineries and fertiliser plants where currently fossil fuels are used as feedstock. The policy has set a target of five million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen production by 2030. Financial and policy support has been extended for green hydrogen production and adoption in industry through the green hydrogen purchase mandate. India is planning to establish a domestic carbon market and has released draft rules for a compliance carbon market. The proposed system will include an emissions intensity target, similar to the previous cap-and-trade system known as Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT). However, the draft rules do not propose an absolute reduction target. At COP26, India committed to transitioning to 100% electric vehicles (EVs), particularly focusing on two and three-wheelers, and mandated that all new two-wheelers be electric by 2026. In 2023-24, electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers comprised over 80% of new EV sales. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme is crucial to this transition, with increased funding allocated for electric public buses and charging infrastructure. Although second phase of FAME (FAME II) concluded in March 2024, expectations for the announcement of FAME III were not met in the 2024 budget. However, the budget did include custom duty waivers on critical minerals to reduce EV costs. Our full policy and action analysis is here ."
India,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"India’s NDC has three main elements: An emissions-intensity target of 45% below 2005 levels by 2030; A target of achieving 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030; and Creation of a carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 GtCO 2 e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. While India indicated in its updated NDC that achieving the 50% non-fossil capacity target would require international support, it is already on track to achieve 60% or more non-fossil capacity by 2030 under current policies. We rate this target as “Highly insufficient” when compared to the level of reductions needed in India under modelled domestic pathways to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, indicating substantial improvement is needed in this target and India will need international support to get onto a 1.5°C pathway."
India,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"We interpret India’s emissions-intensity target as being its unconditional contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. We rate this target against what India’s fair share contribution should be and find it to be “Insufficient.” The “Insufficient” rating indicates that India’s unconditional target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. India’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The quantification of this target varies depending on how GDP is measured and assumptions made about 2030 projections. The transparency of India’s target could be improved with further information on these elements."
India,Land use & forestry,Not significant,"In 2016, India had a net carbon sink of 308 MtCO 2 e. India's target for its land and forestry sector remains unchanged in its updated NDC as it plans an additional 2.5–3 GtCO 2 e of carbon sink by 2030 through additional forest cover. Several policies and measures were adopted under overarching framework of the National Mission of Green India. In its National Forest Policy of 1988 India has set a target of bringing 33% of its geographical area under forest cover. As of 2021, forest and tree cover accounts for 24.6% of the country’s geographical area, an only marginal increase since 2013 (24%)."
India,Net zero target,Poor,"At COP26 in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 2070 net zero target for India and during COP27 India submitted its Long-term Strategy for Low Carbon Development (LT-LEDS). We evaluate the net zero target as “Poor”. Our full net zero analysis is here ."
Germany,Overview,no rating,"Germany’s recent climate policies and its weak economy moved emissions projections significantly downwards, but the three-party coalition government remains divided on comprehensive action across all sectors, leaving the country’s climate targets in danger. Climate action varies drastically within and across sectors. The government, which will remain in power until September 2025, needs to actively engage in climate action across all sectors to ensure that its 2030 target is achieved and its 2045 net zero target remains within reach, while securing and safeguarding social acceptance of the transition. The CAT rates Germany’s climate action as “Insufficient”. The government is in real danger of failing to reach its 2030 target, even if the official government projections claim the target will be met in aggregate. The official projections are very optimistic as they assume the 80% renewable electricity target will be met, CO 2 prices remain high, and emission-intensive industry activity remains low. Recent capacity additions for wind are not at all in line with the renewables goal and CO 2 prices are now lower than assumed. The government therefore needs to remain active to ensure that its own target is safely met. Not only does the government need to meet its 2030 target, it needs to raise its ambition, as it is still not 1.5˚C compatible. Given the 2023 Global Stocktake’s recognition of the need for all countries to reassess and enhance their level of climate ambition and action, Germany, through the Paris Agreement, is obliged to reinforce its 2030 ambition level. The way the government plans to meet the 2030 target is by focusing on strong policy action in only some sectors, while neglecting others. This approach may make it nearly impossible to meet its 2045 climate neutrality target for all sectors. The government weakened the climate change law in May 2024, replacing the compliance mechanism around binding sectoral targets with the ability for sectors to compensate for each other, as long as the overall target is met. The climate change law's amendment conceals the fact that the transport and buildings sectors will exceed their sectoral 2030 targets. It will be almost impossible for the transport sector to catch up on emissions reductions after 2030 without drastic and disruptive measures, such as extremely high CO 2 prices or driving bans. Compensation by the other sectors is also not possible after 2030, as it will become increasingly difficult for sectors to avoid the last few tonnes of CO 2 . It is also of concern that Germany is set to miss the legally binding target within the EU effort-sharing scheme, in which transport and buildings are counted together. This brings the threat of high payments, as any failure to meet the target must be offset by certificates. Overall, without further action, Germany will exceed the target by at least 126 MtCO 2 e between 2021 and 2030.This overshoot will be expensive; for example, if certificates are each priced at EUR 100, the gap in emissions will cost German taxpayers EUR 12bn. Given a broad and just transformation to a 1.5°C compatible society is required, it is inadequate that Germany, one of the world's richest countries, waters down its climate law and fails to implement even simple measures, such as a general speed limit on freeways, as we see record high temperatures and devastating climate impacts around the world and in Germany. Recent positive policy developments include: Emissions outlook improved due to policies of the current government: since the government came into place in 2021, our projected emissions for 2030 have significantly decreased. In 2021, we estimated a reduction under current policies of 55% in 2030 below 1990, while today we estimate a reduction of 62-64%. Renewables and market-driven coal exit: the German government has systematically removed barriers to the expansion of renewables, such as by making the renewable expansion a higher public good. For solar, it is well ahead of its own expansion targets, but behind for wind. At the same time, Germany phased out the last of its nuclear reactors in spring 2022 and shut down 4.5 GW of coal-fired power generation in spring 2024, while maintaining the price of electricity and the stability of the power system. It is set to phase out coal entirely by 2038 at the latest, with the legal possibility of bringing this forward. If the EU ETS prices remain high, they will likely drive coal out of the market in Germany by 2030 due to its unprofitability. Use of levy on heavy-duty trucks to invest in rail infrastructure: Germany increased the levy on heavy-duty trucks on freeways and plans to invest most of the revenues in rail infrastructure. This is a good example of charging polluting activities and supporting less polluting activities. In many areas, Germany still needs to make significant policy improvements to meet its climate and energy targets, and go beyond them, towards a Paris-compatible trajectory: Strengthening the climate law instead of weakening it: the new climate law adopted May 2024 makes the whole government responsible for meeting the targets, rather than individual ministries. However, responsibility of individual ministries for achieving the sectoral targets was explicitly introduced in the old law to make them accountable for climate policy in their respective sector. This dilution of responsibility reduces the likelihood of Germany meeting its targets. The ministries of buildings and transport failed to submit the emergency programme required by the old climate law and have consequently been brought to court by NGOs. The Climate Protection Act needs to be strengthened in order to ensure that the target of climate neutrality by 2045 is achieved. Develop and implement a transport sector strategy: the Transport Ministry appears to have no intention of implementing policies to initiate the sector’s transition towards zero emissions: it ignored the advice of the government’s own environmental agency, which proposed a whole suite of measures that could be used to reduce emissions in the transport sector. Instead, the ministry delayed the EU-wide emission standards for cars by lobbying for e-fuels, raised individual commuter support and expedited the planning of 144 freeway projects. It also abruptly cut the subsidy for EVs, which may not have had immediate effects, but means the government will miss its target of 15 million EVs on the road by 2030 by a wide margin. The ministry has also been the driving force behind weakening the climate law by ditching the law’s requirement for submitting emergency programmes. Before it changed the requirement, the ministry failed to submit emergency programmes for the three years in which the sector overshot its emissions target. Comply with own 65% renewables target in building sector : the government had agreed in its coalition contract and thereafter on the ambitious goal that, as of 2024, all new heating systems would use 65% renewable energy. However, an intensive debate emerged, particularly around a ban on new fossil fuel heating systems. A relatively ambitious draft law was significantly watered down and subsequently adopted. Under this law, neither the CO 2 price nor the sectoral target are strong enough to achieve the originally envisaged 65% goal. The populist debates created uncertainty in the heating industry and kept many households with fossil fuel heating. Send a clear signal against fossil gas in Germany and abroad : in light of the energy crisis, the government continues to promote new infrastructure for fossil fuels in and outside Germany, thereby continuing to create new fossil fuel dependencies. The government has supported the build out of oversized LNG import capacities, gas powered „hydrogen-ready“ power plants and recently decided to still allow for public financing into fossil gas abroad. Focus on a socially just transition : climate policies in general, climate policies are losing support across the German population because public discourse is focused on the costs and burdens of climate action on private households. The government should therefore focus on the social impacts of climate policies. For example, it could bring back the previously agreed upon “climate dividend,” where every citizen would receive a lump sum payment from the revenue generated through the carbon pricing mechanism. The government has postponed this measure to the next legislative period."
Germany,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Germany,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Germany’s overall climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates Germany’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. We rate Germany’s 2030 emissions reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways, consistent with 2°C of warming, and “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to other countries to meet its fair-share contribution. To achieve its target, Germany needs to enhance its policies and actions. It claims that it will achieve its 2030 target with current legislation, but our assessment, supported by other independent analysis, finds that it will miss it."
Germany,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Germany’s policies and actions until 2030 “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. We project that implemented policies and actions will lead to emissions reductions of between 62-64% below 1990 levels by 2030 excl. LULUCF. This is significantly lower than previous projections but still falls short of Germany’s 2030 target of at least 65% reduction below 1990 levels. The German government, in power since December 2021, is significantly accelerating domestic climate policy implementation, but remains deeply divided on the general approach, reflecting the unconsolidated positions of the different coalition parties. While the Green Party is pushing for fast action, e.g. in buildings and the expansion of renewables, the Social Democrats and in particular, the Liberal Party are delaying implementation. All parties support expansion of LNG terminals, which is counterproductive to climate policy. In the 2021 coalition contract, the government decided not to raise the ambition of the mitigation target, but promised that the measures adopted in the agreement would overachieve the target (ARD, 2021). But with currently implemented measures, Germany’s 2030 target is in danger, its overachievement is very unlikely, and it is certainly not close to putting emissions onto a 1.5˚C compatible pathway by 2030. Outlook on greenhouse gas emissions improved significantly since the new government has been in power, but its own 2030 target is unlikely to be met with the current policies. Also, the legally binding target within the EU effort-sharing scheme, in which transport and buildings are counted together, will not be met. In addition, the government weakened the climate law. 50% of electricity in 2023 was generated from renewable sources. The share of coal in the electricity system has been halved over the last five years, but still stands at 23% for January to mid-April 2024. Solar expansion is well ahead of the target, while wind is behind. The coalition also wanted to introduce a climate check for each new piece of legislation, but implementation has been slow. In spring 2023, the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) tendered a project to consider possible approaches, the research was not completed as of June 2024 and a climate check was not yet introduced. To cope with Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine and related energy security issues, Germany has introduced a set of measures, some of which are counterproductive to climate policy. The government still plans to develop an overcapacity of LNG import infrastructure, which risks further locking in fossil fuels and brings into question Germany’s long-term ambitions for GHG neutrality. The coalition committed to making the climate transition socially just, but has so far failed to do so in various areas. A climate dividend (“Klimageld”), to pay back revenues from carbon pricing on a per capita basis, was seeded in the coalition contract but will most likely not be implemented in this legislative period. A temporary rebate on VAT for fuels and a compensation mechanism for high gas prices were given without social differentiation. One positive outcome is that the new heating law contains plans to differentiate the subsidies for CO 2 -free heating systems by household income. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Germany,National target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Germany’s 2030 reduction target of 65% below 1990 levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s proposed reduction target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements, if changed to 69%. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. While this target represents a significant improvement compared to its previous target, Germany’s new target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvement. The CAT’s assessment of Germany’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance."
Germany,National target against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate Germany’s 2030 target of 65% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s target in 2030 and its climate finance contribution needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to its fair share. Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to others to meet its fair-share contribution. Germany’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C."
Germany,Climate finance,Insufficient,"Germany’s international public climate finance contributions are better than most developed countries but still rated ""Insufficient."" Germany has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share as assessed by the CAT. To improve its rating, Germany needs to increase its international climate finance contributions in the order of factor of three, and, most urgently, stop funding fossil fuels abroad. At COP26, Germany signed a declaration to stop financing fossil fuels abroad, but later pushed to roll back this decision. The CAT rates Germany’s international climate finance “Insufficient”. Germany’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates Germany’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”."
Germany,Net zero target,Average,"In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law. The net zero target generally covers key elements but fails to meet good practice standards for some of them. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Average.” The German government needs to legislate its commitments to include international aviation and shipping emissions and undertake planning on how to reach the 2045 target to improve its rating to “Acceptable”."
Viet Nam,Overview,no rating,"Viet Nam is seeing growing momentum for renewable energy integration and coal phase-out, aligning with its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Yet these initiatives are currently impeded by the country's dependence on coal beyond 2030 and the government's plan to increase use of fossil gas as a “transition fuel”. The increasing imports of coal and gas raise concerns about energy security, despite the pursuit of cleaner energy sources. While there has been significant momentum in the deployment of renewable energy in recent years, the targets for solar and wind energy rollout in the government’s plans are still insufficient. The modest growth in ambition for reducing power generation emissions fails to offset the absence of policies aimed at addressing emissions from other sectors of the economy, where efforts remain lacklustre. The CAT’s overall rating of Viet Nam’s climate targets and action remains “Critically insufficient”. In December 2022, Viet Nam joined the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to achieve its net-zero commitment by 2050, initially receiving USD 15.5bn until 2026-2028. The partnership strives to achieve a power sector emissions peak of 170 MtCO 2 e by 2030 while aiming for a 47% renewable energy share by the same year. However, the JETP's focus on coal elimination inadvertently promotes fossil gas, a key component of Viet Nam’s latest Power Development Plan. Worries are also emerging over the partnership’s loan-heavy financing approach, which has the potential to impose debt burdens on a developing nation like Viet Nam. The full and substantial implementation of the JETP may result in additional reductions of 4-18% in emissions below current policies scenario by 2030. Following the signing of the JETP, Viet Nam adopted the long-awaited Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8) in May 2023, sending mixed signals to Viet Nam’s power sector. While scaling down its earlier coal expansion plans and emphasising the integration of renewable energy, Viet Nam is concurrently strengthening its reliance on fossil gas for power generation, expanding gas infrastructure, and introducing LNG imports. However, gas is not a transition fuel - the IEA's latest Net Zero Emissions Scenario is clear that power generation from natural gas must drops by 98% between 2022 and 2050. Viet Nam is facing severe climate change-induced droughts, with disruptions in hydropower generation and over-reliance on coal-fired generation ultimately leading to extensive power shortages. Viet Nam’s emissions are set to keep rising until 2030, contrary to what is needed to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal. To reverse this trend, Viet Nam could: Expedite the phase-out of coal power , by developing an effective retirement plan of the existing coal power plants more ambitious than the plans in the JETP, and issuing more detailed rules regarding the reconversion of the existing fleet. Avoid relying on gas as a “transition fuel” to increase energy security, affordability, and profit from the multiple co-benefits coming with the phase-out of fossil fuels and avoid potential emissions lock-in. Enable a swift rollout of renewable energy sources through investments in the grid. When supported by adequate power transmission and distribution infrastructure, these solutions already offer greater affordability compared to investing in fossil fuel projects. Viet Nam benefits from a substantial wind and solar energy potential. Address emissions from the agriculture and industry sectors , which accounted respectively for 18% and 17% of the Viet Nam’s emissions. The current lack of policy directions leaves the emissions from these two sectors unchecked. Despite these drawbacks, the latest developments include some positive developments: Coal power generation now has a phase-out timeline of 2050 , although it lacks specific details. This timeline completes Viet Nam's commitment made at COP26, where it pledged to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation and cease the construction of new coal plants. The pipeline of coal projects has shrunk significantly , decreasing the risks of fossil fuel lock-in. The JETP and its inclusion in the government's power development plan can act as catalysts for the renewable power sources rollout by channelling investments towards the energy transition."
Viet Nam,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Viet Nam’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Viet Nam’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with more than 4°C of warming when compared with modelled domestic pathways and the extent of reductions that need to be taking place inside its borders. Viet Nam updated its NDC targets in 2022 without increasing ambition. Its updated NDC strengthened its targets on paper, but will not drive real-world emission reductions beyond its current level of climate action. The CAT rates these updated targets as “Critically insufficient” against both modelled domestic pathways and what a fair contribution for Viet Nam would be. Viet Nam’s current policies result in emissions levels lower than its targets, but are still “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam needs to set more ambitious targets for emissions reductions and implement the associated policies to get a better rating."
Viet Nam,Policies and action  against fair share,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Viet Nam’s climate policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution. Under Viet Nam’s current policies and action, emissions will continue to rise to around 592-692 MtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. Under a fair contribution for 1.5°C emissions would roughly stabilise at today’s level, at about 350 MtCO 2 e in 2030. In May 2023, the Viet Nam government adopted the final version of the Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8). In this plan Viet Nam has highlighted the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the PDP8 is centred around growing dependence on fossil gas and LNG is put forward as “transition fuel” towards net zero. Coal usage for power generation remains a concern for Viet Nam, although showing notable recent decline in pipeline largely due to insufficient project financing. The PDP8 aims to eliminate coal capacity by 2050, though coal will persist in the energy mix through this decade, contributing around 20% of installed capacity by 2030, an improvement on the 2021 figure of 30%. This updated target marks a significant enhancement over the previous PDP7 goal. Viet Nam is planning to increase both domestic production and import of coal for power generation. The ratio of domestically produced to imported coal will decline to 36-39% in 2030 from 46% in 2021. An increased reliance on coal imports will worsen Viet Nam’s energy security and make it more vulnerable to price volatility. Adoption of the PDP8 confirms the scale up of fossil gas power generation, and its prioritisation over renewable energy rollout in Viet Nam. Fossil gas-based power generation capacity will be 25% in 2030. To support this expansion of gas-based power generation, Viet Nam is planning to increase domestic production of gas as well as import, further increasing vulnerability to energy security threats in a complex geopolitical landscape. The plan proposes a share of renewable generation of 31-39% by 2030, and 47% in case of a “full and substantial” implementation of the JETP by international partners. The Master Plan for National Energy sets an energy-related greenhouse gas emissions target of 399-449 MtCO 2 e by 2030, compared to 259 MtCO 2 e in 2021. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Viet Nam,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"We rate Viet Nam’s 2030 conditional target against a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway as “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam’s conditional target equates to 620 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF). Viet Nam can achieve this target without any additional effort beyond current policies and action, which we estimated to be 592-692 MtCO 2 e by 2030. Viet Nam would need to reduce the emissions level of the current policies and actions trajectory by 40-49% (353 MtCO 2 e) by 2030 to be in line with 1.5°C. Substantial improvement is needed in this target."
Viet Nam,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Critically insufficient,"Viet Nam’s unconditional target equates to 863 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which we rate as “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam will achieve this target without any additional effort beyond current policies and actions. Viet Nam would need to reduce the current policies and action pathway by 41-49% (to 350 MtCO 2 e) to be in line with a 1.5°C fair share pathway. Viet Nam updated its Paris Agreement target in November 2022. The target was 39 MtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) stronger than the previous NDC, and the transparency and sectoral coverage have improved. Yet, the target does not drive real climate action as it will be easily overachieved with current policies and action. Both Viet Nam’s NDC targets are consistent with a warming of over 4°C: if all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C."
Viet Nam,Land use & forestry,Not significant,"In 2016, Viet Nam had a net carbon sink capacity of 39 MtCO 2 e. In its National Climate Change Strategy to 2050, Viet Nam has established a target for its land use and forestry sector with the aim of reducing 70% of remaining emissions, thereby increase the carbon absorption rate by 20% and achieving a total sink capacity of 95 MtCO 2 e by 2030. It will aim to maintain national forest coverage of 43%, by improving forest quality and sustainable forest management techniques, and is critical to achieve net zero for Viet Nam."
Viet Nam,Net zero target,Average,"Viet Nam announced a target to achieve net zero by 2050 during the COP26 World Leaders’ Summit in 2021. In July 2022, Viet Nam reiterated its commitment to reach net zero in the decision approving its National Climate Change Strategy, aimed at guiding its planning to achieve net zero by 2050. Viet Nam’s net zero target is conditional on international financial support. The CAT rates Viet Nam’s target as “Average”. The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
United Kingdom,Overview,no rating,"The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential. As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such, we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed from the new government’s climate action. We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025. The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate. This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government. The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country. A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030. However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should: Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved. Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance. Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which: goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms. This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK. However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration. The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including: Ramping up renewables. The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition. Accelerating electrification. Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed. Reversing recent rollbacks . The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks."

United Kingdom,Overall rating,Insufficient,"NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement . We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025. The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as ""Almost Sufficient"". However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as ""Insufficient"". Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased. Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to ""1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible"" include: Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC. Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets. Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts."
United Kingdom,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C. Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context. In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025. The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including: In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables. In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting. In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses. However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

United Kingdom,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being ""Almost Sufficient"" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C."
United Kingdom,NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway). If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C."
United Kingdom,Climate finance,Highly insufficient,"The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”."
United Kingdom,Net zero target,Acceptable,"In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

Ukraine,Overview,no rating,We have suspended our rating for Ukraine as the country defends itself from the unlawful Russian invasion. We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine at this terrible time. Our previous assessment is available here .
USA,Overview,no rating,"Under the Biden Administration, the US has seen promising signs of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is mobilising historic levels of investment in clean energy solutions and activating subnational and non-state action on climate change. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recently revised regulations in the power and transport sectors further enhance the government’s climate policy package. Although the country has made progress under the Biden Administration, the US will still be far from meeting its domestic climate target—let alone aligning its emissions with a 1.5°C trajectory—without additional, drastic emissions reductions measures. To meet its domestic target, the US would need to bolster its policy packages at the sectoral level to address the rising demand for electricity across sectors. The government would also need to reverse the trend of increasing fossil fuel extraction. CAT analysis in 2022 shows the US is also moving in the wrong direction regarding its international support for fossil fuels. Overall, the CAT rates the US climate targets, action, and climate finance at the end of the Biden Administration as “Insufficient”. An assessment of the impact of the Trump Administration will follow once information is available. On 5 November 2024,  former President Donald Trump won the US election, and will take office on 20 January 2025. The US will continue to face the challenges in meeting its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and achieving future climate goals aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. Reaching these targets will require the implementation of additional policies, which may prove challenging under the Trump Administration. However, opportunities remain for climate action at the state and municipality level and for furthering the progress made under the IRA. As of 2022, the US has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target. CAT current policies projections, which include the IRA, show a more pronounced reduction in emissions until 2030 compared to historic reductions. Although CAT projections suggest the US will close the gap by an additional 30%–44% by 2030, it is still 23%–37% short of meeting its 2030 emissions reduction target; evidence that further action is critically necessary. The current US target of 50–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 is not 1.5˚C compatible. Although there have been positive developments under the IRA, oil and gas production has increased under the Biden Administration. The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record-level production in 2023. The country is also the worlds' largest fossil gas producer and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter for liquified natural gas (LNG). In 2022, fossil fuels also received the largest subsidies from the government since 2010. In early 2024, the Biden Administration placed a temporary moratorium on pending LNG export terminals. However, the administration continues to approve large-scale fossil fuel projects. The IRA has had its most positive impact on the power sector . The government’s decarbonisation target for the power sector aligns with the CAT’s Paris Agreement-compatible benchmarks, as well as with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero strategy: by 2035, the US aims to achieve net zero emissions in the sector. The IRA has stimulated large investment in technologies critical for decarbonising the power sector, but barriers remain; especially since the demand for electricity is expected to grow significantly. Important areas for the power sector's transition, such as the electricity grid, have been significantly underfunded. The anticipated coal phase-out, as out outlined in the recently revised EPA standards, will be too late to be Paris Agreement compatible, and fossil gas-fired plants are largely exempt from the standards. In the transport sector, the IRA has particularly supported the manufacturing and uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), while the EPA has enhanced the regulatory framework for EVs by revising its emissions standards until 2032. The government aims to decarbonise the sector by 2050. However, this timeline is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The IRA has spurred significant investment in the domestic EV value chain, especially in battery manufacturing, and the deployment of HDVs in commercial and public fleets. The act also expands subsidies for EV purchases and unlocks new funding for public transport. A major ambition gap continues to exist in the industry sector, where the government has set a decarbonisation objective but has not specified a clear timeline for reaching the objective. The IRA provides a patchwork of instruments to support technologies to decarbonise the industry sector. The IRA unlocks billions in funding for industrial technologies in their research and development phase, while introducing and expanding tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage deployment, renewable energy and critical material projects, and clean hydrogen production. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM) continues to phase down F-gases significantly. The government’s emissions reductions targets for the buildings sector are not aligned with the Paris Agreement. Due to limited federal measures to regulate building energy use and emissions, the decarbonisation of the sector will likely heavily rely on electrification. Without further efforts to reduce building envelope energy use and emissions, this dependency will put increasing pressure on the power sector and its decarbonisation. The agriculture sector lacks a clear decarbonisation objective and, while the IRA allocates funding to boost conservation programmes, the act’s measures do not seem to meaningfully reduce sectoral emissions and even include funding for livestock production. The US has neither developed or implemented any regulations to address emissions from animal production, nor has it meaningfully encouraged dietary change. Such demand-side changes could result in large mitigation impacts in the US, which has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world. Net forest sinks are threatened by land conversion, increasing demand for timber products, and more frequent natural disturbances from climate change. The IRA increased funding for the National Forest Service and other programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities, but logging efforts are nevertheless set to increase. Aside from strengthening its sectoral policies and targets and reducing fossil fuel exploitation and exportation, the US should address gaps in its international climate contributions: Increase international climate finance contributions and cease funding fossil fuels abroad. The Biden Administration is still far from reaching its pledge of USD 11.4bn/year. In FY2023, only USD 1bn was appropriated for climate finance by the US Congress. The US also broke its commitment to stop financing fossil fuels abroad when the American Export-Import Bank (EXIM) lent USD 100m to Indonesia to expand an oil refinery in May 2023. Increase the ambition of its NDC. The US has not yet updated its climate target despite the commitment to do so by countries at COP26 in 2021. For the US climate target to be compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory, the country must reduce its emissions by at least 62%–65% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF), while providing more financial support to other countries."
USA,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
USA,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates the combination of the US 2030 climate targets, policies, and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the totality of the government’s policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The US 2030 domestic emissions reduction target (NDC) is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways, but not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. US policies and action lead to falling emissions in 2030, but not by enough to meet either its targets or the 1.5°C limit. The US does not meet its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its domestic targets and policies, needs to provide and mobilise further support to developing countries."
USA,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its mitigation targets. The CAT projects US GHG emissions in 2030 to be 29%–39% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), falling short of its 2030 NDC target (44%–49% excl. LULUCF), and significantly short of its fair share target. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. Although the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry, it is the most ambitious climate policy package in US history and brings the country closer to meeting its 2030 target. Although the IRA is a major step towards achieving the US NDC, the government still needs to introduce additional policies and action to achieve its domestic emissions reduction target. EPA standards in the power and transport sector passed in 2024 are important complementary instruments. However, more ambitious (sectoral) climate policies at the federal and state levels are still needed to reach the US targets. The increasing trend in oil and gas production also needs to be reversed. The projected emissions trajectory range in this update is wider than in the previous update, due to the inclusion of a broader set of models to estimate the IRA's impact. The range of policy projections for the US falls into the “Insufficient” category but reaches the “Almost sufficient” category at its lower end. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the government’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvement to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. See full summary of policies and actions here ."
USA,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US domestic target for 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C."

The CAT’s assessment of the US’ total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the 2030 target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of further financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach up to 3°C."
USA,Climate finance,Critically insufficient,"We rate the United States’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on the government’s 2022 OECD contributions. The Biden Administration committed to increase its climate finance contributions but contributions until 2024 remain low compared to its fair share. In FY2024, only USD 1bn (approximately the same amount as in 2023) were appropriated for climate finance by Congress. While the government claims larger sums have been made available (notably, USD 5.8 bn in 2022), these funds mainly relate to adaptation and/or are not principal financing. Only principal mitigation financing is accounted for in the CAT's rating. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and stop supporting fossil fuels abroad. The US’ climate finance is not sufficient to improve the rating of its NDC against its fair share, and the CAT rates the US’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”."
USA,Net zero target,Average,"We evaluate the US net zero target as: Average. The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), in which the US officially commits to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 latest. The net zero target covers all GHG emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO 2 removal by nature- and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning. The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target, such as including international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly committing to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets."
UAE,Overview,no rating,"Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility. The UAE’s large renewables investment plans continue to be overshadowed by its fossil fuel expansion and investment plans. The CAT rates the UAE’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”. This assessment is based on the 2030 target. Our analysis of the 2035 target can be found here . There are two main changes in our current assessment: first, the UAE has now updated its national GHG inventory which leads to a 15% downwards revision in historical emissions estimates. This is mainly due to lower estimates for industrial process emissions and from energy emissions, especially a sharp decrease in fugitive emissions compared to third-party estimates used in previous assessments. Second, the UAE has published a comprehensive policy plan as part of its long-term strategy (LTS), including new current policy projections. Our updated assessment includes these projections as part of the current policy range, which reflects climate action across all sectors of the economy. The lower bound of our projections now leads to a ~18% downwards revision compared to our last assessment. While there is still a 29-74 MtCO 2 e gap between current policies and the 2030 NDC target, the UAE could be close to achieving it with the planned policies for achieving its net zero target – assuming that the revised emission estimates are accurate. The UAE’s 2023 NDC sets a target of reducing emissions to 185 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excluding land use, land use change and forestry), a 12% decrease below its previous target issued in 2022 and 13–28% below current emission levels. The CAT rates this target as “Almost sufficient” compared to a 1.5°C aligned domestic pathway and “Insufficient” when compared to the UAE’s fair share. Under current policies, the CAT estimates the UAE emissions will, in a best-case scenario, plateau close to 2022 levels until 2030 or continue to increase, meaning the country is set to miss its emission reduction target. To meet its NDC 2030 target, the government needs to implement more ambitious policies and reduce its 2030 emissions further. In its LTS, the UAE has set out a detailed set of measures to reduce emissions in the power, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors including both currently implemented policies and additional policies planned to be implemented in the coming years. The UAE plans to reduce its emissions to 3.5 MtCO 2 e by 2050. In the industry sector, which includes oil and gas production, the UAE plans to reduce 32% of its emissions through CCS. This translates to roughly 43.5 MtCO 2 e in 2050. In the power sector, it is expected that fossil gas will account for 50% of total installed capacity, but the UAE assumes emissions from the sector will be zero. This implies an extensive use of CCS in the power sector. This technology is nowhere near the scale and commercial viability needed to deliver on the needed emissions reductions, in large part due to both technological (such as CO 2 capture rates) and cost challenges. Because of this, high reliance on CCS undermines the credibility of the UAE’s medium and long-term emission reduction plans. The UAE is planning to increase fossil fuel production and consumption substantially by 2030, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit warming to below 1.5°C. At the end of 2023, the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, awarded contracts worth USD 17bn for the development of the Hail and Ghasha offshore gas fields, as part of a USD 150bn fossil fuel expansion plan. Emissions from the production and use of this fossil gas by 2030 would be equivalent to 15–20% of the country’s present annual domestic emissions. In 2023, the UAE updated its 2050 Energy Strategy . The updated strategy includes a 30% “clean power” capacity target by 2030. The UAE has also announced an investment of USD 54bn in renewables over the next seven years to support its 2030 target. However, the strategy still foresees a large role for fossil gas in 2050, which puts in question the UAE’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by then due to their high reliance on CCS. The UAE continues to promote the use of CSS in order to continue exploring fossil fuels. In October 2023, ADNOC doubled its CCS target from 5 to 10 MtCO 2 e removed annually by 2030, which is only around 4% of its current emissions and less than 2% of its exported emissions. There are some positive developments in the UAE, including: The submission of a new and improved national GHG inventory, The pledge to contribute USD 100 million to the UNFCCC Loss and Damage Fund, The submission of a stronger NDC target in November 2024, now presented as an absolute emissions target instead of a reduction below a business-as-usual scenario, The submission of clear sectoral mitigation plans in its LTS, including sectoral targets, current and planned measures, and current policy scenarios, Continued investment into large scale renewables both at home and abroad. To improve its climate action, the UAE could: Update its power sector targets moving towards a 100% renewables power system and away from natural gas, Update its energy sector policies and rapidly diversify its economy away from fossil fuels both domestically and for exports, a necessary step to make the UAE’s 2050 net zero ambitions credible, Reduce its reliance on CCS as a mitigation measure and instead plan to transition away from fossil fuels in power generation and in heavy industry."

UAE,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates the UAE’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. We have improved the UAE’s overall rating compared to our previous assessment for three reasons. First, the UAE’s newly published current policy scenarios (included in its LTS) lead to 17% lower emissions by 2030. This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios, which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050. Second, the UAE’s 5 th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions. These also impact the absolute value estimated for the UAE’s 2030 emissions under current policies. Third, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating."

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero. However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions. The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative . At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details. In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter , further signalling commitment to reaching net zero."
Türkiye,Overview,no rating,"Türkiye’s climate policy can be characterised by a blend of the good, the bad and the ugly. A commitment to reaching 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035 is commendable, but that 2035 target would need to increase to 150 GW to align with 1.5°C. Meanwhile, efforts to increase fossil gas production and become a gas hub, as well as continued coal use, put Türkiye’s commitment to its net zero target in question and risk locking Türkiye into a fossil fuel intensive future. Türkiye’s NDC is far above its current policies and therefore demonstrates little to no ambition in cutting emissions in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal. The NDC target allows emissions to continue increasing and will easily be over-achieved with current policies, meaning that it does not drive real-world emissions reductions nor the highest ambition policies. Türkiye will need to submit a significantly stronger emissions reduction target for 2030, develop a coal phase-out plan and stop investing in fossil fuels if it is serious about its commitment to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2053. Türkiye’s overall CAT rating remains unchanged at ‘Critically insufficient’, though it has seen an improvement in current policies to ‘Highly insufficient’. Türkiye’s NDC provides an absolute emissions target of 695 MtCO 2 e (incl. LULUCF) in 2030, which equates to 765 MtCO 2 e when LULUCF is excluded. It also allows emissions to continue increasing until 2038, which is far too late to align with 1.5°C or achieve its net zero target in 2053 without extremely steep reductions over a 15-year period. Türkiye should submit a stronger, 1.5°C compatible NDC which can drive ambition and provide a realistic pathway towards achieving the 2053 target. Türkiye’s recently-announced Roadmap for Renewable Energy to 2035 aims to roll out renewables at a rate of “at least” 7.5–8 GW a year until 2035, along with investments of USD 28 bn to upgrade the grid. This represents a sustainable form of diversifying Türkiye’s energy mix. Türkiye has large potential for wind and solar, and both technologies are witnessing declining costs; a trend that will only continue. They therefore represent a cost-effective and sustainable way to increase energy independence. While Türkiye’s 2035 wind and solar target should be lauded as an impressive commitment to scaling up clean energy, without major decreases in energy demand it will not be enough to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal. Plans to simultaneously and substantially increase domestic fossil fuel production and use run counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement, which requires a phasing out of fossil fuel capacity rather than a scaling up. Türkiye is investing heavily in oil and gas exploration, with plans for 270 drilling operations in 2025. If this course is not reversed, it risks locking Türkiye into a carbon-intensive future. Even more worrying is Türkiye’s continued reliance on coal. Despite its severe health and environmental impacts, Türkiye is poised to become the largest producer of coal-fired electricity in Europe by 2025. However, a significant coal pipeline has recently been shelved as state support for renewables grows, indicating positive steps towards reducing Türkiye’s coal dependence in the longer-term. Given that a coal phase-out is low hanging fruit for decarbonising the economy, Türkiye should commit to phasing out existing coal capacity from its power sector. Recent positive policy developments include: The 2035 renewables target combined with investments in grid infrastructure: an important step towards decarbonising the grid. Efforts to streamline permitting processes for renewable energy projects from the current four years to two years or less, introducing tenders, and offering a floor price and long-term electricity purchase guarantees to investors: this will improve the regulatory environment for investing in renewables and allow quicker returns on investments. Investments of USD 20 bn to improve energy efficiency by 16% by 2030: this will take pressure off the grid and support Türkiye in decoupling emissions from economic growth. The introduction of an Emissions Trading System (ETS) similar to the European Union’s ETS: this will be a central pillar of reducing Türkiye’s industrial emissions. The ETS, which will also apply to the shipping sector, can improve the competitiveness of Turkish industry and provide a more predictable emissions reduction path for companies to follow. Investments in the manufacturing of Türkiye’s own domestically-produced electric vehicle, the Togg, can combine industrial policy with transport policy, providing green jobs and growth while supporting emissions reductions in the transport sector. To improve its climate targets and action rating, Türkiye could: Develop a fossil fuel phase-out plan for the power sector. Türkiye is currently on track to becoming the largest producer of coal-fired electricity in Europe by 2025 and is investing heavily in fossil gas, both of which should be phased out of the power sector in the 2030s. Strengthen its wind and solar target with the aim of bringing 150 GW of capacity online by 2035. Speed up implementation; in 2023 just 2 GW of solar and just 411 MW of wind capacity was added to the grid. Considering that current targets fall short of aligning with 1.5°C compatible pathway, failing to implement them is inexcusable. Set a stronger 2030 NDC target that goes beyond current policies and drives emissions reductions. Ideally, this would be in the form of an emissions limit or reduction from a historical base year. There is much to be improved in Türkiye’s draft climate law. Pathways that demonstrate how Türkiye intends to reach net zero, and developing clear policies with actionable targets and measures can improve transparency and help ministries to implement climate goals effectively."
Türkiye,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Türkiye,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Türkiye’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Critically insufficient”, a rating that indicates Türkiye’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. In April 2023, Türkiye submitted an updated NDC target. However, this new 2030 NDC target relies on a business as usual (BAU) scenario which uses a historical base year of 2012. Emissions have grown far slower than emissions under that BAU scenario. The target does not drive real-world emissions reductions, and cannot be considered at all ambitious. Current policy projections indicate that Türkiye’s emissions will continue to grow. Despite recently improved renewables target, without a peaking and rapid decline in economy-wide emissions, Türkiye remains well off-track from aligning with 1.5°C. For a better rating, Türkiye needs to set an ambitious NDC target and develop and implement policies that will set its projected emissions on a clear downward trajectory across all sectors."
Türkiye,Policies and action  against fair share,Highly insufficient,"Türkiye’s current policies and action are “Highly insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Türkiye needs to focus on adopting further policies and action to stop its emissions growth and start reducing emissions towards decarbonisation. Plans to scale up wind and solar by at least 7.5–8 GW a year until 2035, along with a USD 20 billion package to reduce energy demand by 16% by 2030 represent positive steps towards decarbonising Türkiye’s economy. However, they are not enough to align with 1.5°C. If Türkiye succeeds in meeting its annual additions target by 2035, it will have 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity. To be 1.5°C aligned, however, Turkey would need to install 150 GW by 2035. At the same time, Türkiye continues to invest in fossil fuels to meet energy demand, with plans to become a fossil gas hub and 4.6 GW of coal capacity still in the pipeline. These developments stand in contrast to 1.5°C compatible scenarios; to align with 1.5°C, Türkiye needs to effectively phase out fossil fuels from the power sector in the 2030s, providing almost 100% renewable electricity by 2035. Türkiye is launching an Emissions Trading System (ETS) which will play an important part in cutting industrial emissions and adapting to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, thus maintaining competitiveness for Türkiye’s export-driven industries. Along with cutting emissions in carbon-intensive industries through the ETS, Türkiye is investing in the domestic manufacturing of electric cars and trains. Through domestic production, it is likely that this will feed into higher uptake in the Turkish transport sector. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Türkiye,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"We rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Türkiye already achieves this target based on our emissions estimate for 2030 under current policies, which further highlights the weakness of this target. Türkiye should significantly strengthen its 2030 target."
Türkiye,NDC target against fair share,Critically insufficient,"We also rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s NDC target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C."
Türkiye,Climate finance,Information incomplete,We do not have sufficient information to assess Türkiye’s climate finance contribution.
Türkiye,Net zero target,Poor,"In 2021, Türkiye announced a 2053 net zero target. Since then, Türkiye’s Climate Council released a roadmap to achieve net zero emissions and the government developed a draft climate law. Türkiye was expected to submit a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in 2022, but has not done so. It is now expected to be released at COP29. We evaluate the 2053 target as: ""Poor"". The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
The Gambia,Overview,no rating,"NOTE: We have updated our analysis of The Gambia's net zero target. The rest of the assessment is from our July 2022 update. The Gambia’s domestic efforts to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement are in line with its fair share due to its small historical responsibility and strong development needs, but with international support it could still significantly improve the extent of its climate action. At a time when countries should be moving away from fossil fuels, The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil and gas in an attempt to offset its dependency on imported fuel oil. Whilst The Gambia’s reliance on imported oil is a burden on its economy and leaves the country vulnerable to a volatile commodity market exacerbated by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the most sustainable way to escape this is via accelerated deployment of renewable energy and electrification of transport. To achieve this The Gambia will need international support. Increasing its renewable energy generation and transitioning to an affordable sustainable, renewable energy system would put The Gambia fully onto a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, avoid carbon intensive technology lock-in, and improve its energy security, while also achieving a critical milestone for the country’s socio-economic development. The Gambia’s land sector, accounting for one third of emissions, has turned from a net sink to a source, and, if deforestation continues at the same rate, the government warns there will be no forests left by 2050. It has implemented policies to begin turning the situation around. The CAT had rated the indicative 2030 target in The Gambia’s first NDC and policies as “1.5°C compatible.” However, while The Gambia’s 2021 NDC is a progression from its 2016 NDC in some ways, such as expanding sector coverage, the update does not lead to lower emissions than the first NDC due to a revision of the BAU scenario. The total absolute emissions level in 2030 is higher in the updated NDC than in the first. As a result, the CAT’s rating of its conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and the overall rating have fallen from ""1.5°C compatible"" to ""Almost sufficient"". The country will need international support and more stringent policies to meet its NDC targets."
The Gambia,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates The Gambia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient ,” a rating that indicates that some of The Gambia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, but could be with moderate improvements."
The Gambia,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"The CAT rates The Gambia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair-share contribution. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond The Gambia’s fair share with the help of international support. The Gambia has an NDC target that would bend its emissions downwards; however, its current policies are not on track to meet this target. The Gambia will need to implement more stringent policies to meet its NDC target, for which it will need additional international support. One of The Gambia’s strategies to achieve its emission reductions targets is the uptake of renewable energy technology. After a slow start and delays due to COVID-19, The Gambia is now rapidly increasing its renewable energy capacity with a total of 170 MW in solar PV projects in the pipeline for 2021-2025 partially financed by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. At a time when countries should be moving away from fossil fuels, The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil and gas in an attempt to offset its dependency on imported fuel oil. The Gambia’s continued reliance on oil is not only a burden on the economy but also leaves the country vulnerable to a volatile commodity market exacerbated by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
The Gambia,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates The Gambia’s NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within The Gambia’s borders to limit warming to 1.5°C. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that The Gambia’s NDC target is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The Gambia's approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C."
The Gambia,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"The CAT rates the unconditional component of The Gambia’s NDC target “1.5°C compatible” when compared to what its fair share contribution is. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that The Gambia’s fair share target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Gambia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here ."
The Gambia,Land use & forestry,Source & Sink,"The Gambia’s emissions from Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributed to almost one third of the country’s total emissions in 2010. Until 1998 The Gambia’s LULUCF sector was a net carbon sink, but from 1999 onwards the sector has been a net carbon source (Republic of The Gambia, 2012). In 2000, The Gambia’s LULUCF sector had net emissions of approximately 0.52 MtCO 2 e, and by 2010 emissions had increased by over 200% to 1.18 MtCO 2 e (Republic of The Gambia, 2012, 2020)."
The Gambia,Net zero target,Poor,"In September 2022, The Gambia submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for “climate neutral” development by 2050. Although the LTS provides a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero GHG emission by 2050, it does not include transparent quantifiable targets for how The Gambia will switch its LULUCF sector from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink by 2050 and only covers 81% of GHG emissions. The CAT emissions reduction target evaluation may improve in the future as The Gambia provides more information on its projected pathways. Another way that The Gambia could improve this rating is if its net zero target were to cover more than 95% its total emissions. The CAT evaluates the comprehensiveness of The Gambia’s net zero target as “Poor”. The full analysis is here ."
Thailand,Overview,no rating,"NOTE: This assessment is based on our September 2021 assessment with updates to the targets, net zero and Glasgow sectoral pledge sections (under policies and action), which are also reflected in the summary. Emissions pathways have also been revised due to latest historical emissions data and GDP forecasts. No policy updates were quantified in this revision. Thailand’s overall climate performance has been historically weak despite some good intentions and expected forthcoming positive developments. One positive update is that Thailand raised its ambition with its Second NDC and revised Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) in November 2022, which results in strengthened targets. While the updated NDC is an improvement, it does not yet reflect a fair share contribution and is still far from being 1.5°C compatible. Thailand is not projected to reach its new targets under current policies, but could reach its unconditional target under planned policies. Prior to COP26 in 2021, Thailand submitted a “carbon neutrality” by 2065 target. Thailand’s Second NDC and revised LT-LEDS now references a revised and accelerated target of “carbon neutrality” by 2050 and net zero GHGs by 2065. Thailand’s current policies projections are unable to achieve its climate commitments and signal a need to accelerate mitigation efforts, which could begin with the rollout of its planned policies. Thailand’s last shift in power sector planning, from a dependency on coal to fossil gas over the next two decades, lowers the overall emission pathways in its planned policies but nevertheless exacerbates fossil fuel (gas) lock-in and delays meaningful decarbonisation efforts. In 2022, Thailand has been focused on securing fossil supply and doubling down on gas as the energy fuel for the future, having planned a build-out of new LNG import capacity, approved a new 1,400 MW gas-fired power plant, and secured gas fields in Myanmar. The potential for renewable energy remains high and largely untapped, with deployment stagnating since pre-COVID pandemic. However, Thailand has shown a recent intent to get on track: the government is in the process of drafting a range of important climate-relevant documents, including its Climate Change Act and National Energy Plan (all subsumed energy documents due to be updated). In November 2022, Thailand revised its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), first submitted in September 2021. These policies will strengthen the country’s climate governance, include power sector targets with greater ambition, and also include more details on the implementation roadmap towards achieving long-term carbon neutrality and net-zero targets. Finalisation of the National Energy Plan in 2023, would increase Thailand’s renewable share targets and lower emission pathways, but will remain off of a 1.5°C compatible pathway. Until the next wave of Thailand’s climate strategies and its accompanying mitigation policies are implemented and strengthened, the CAT rates Thailand’s unconditional climate target and policies as “Critically Insufficient”."
Thailand,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Thailand’s overall rating as “Critically insufficient”, indicating that Thailand’s current climate policies and commitments reflect minimal action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement. Under Thailand’s current policies and unconditional NDC target, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. Thailand’s conditional target shows greater ambition, but is not yet compatible with 2°C or 1.5°C. For Thailand to improve its rating, it needs to establish the policies needed to curb its expected growth in emissions and plan for the long term towards deep decarbonisation. As a first step, it needs to not only solidify its energy and power sector policy plans but to revise and strengthen them to move away from decades of envisaged fossil fuel dependence. These are currently being revised in alignment with the adoption of Thailand’s new National Energy Plan due in 2023. Adoption of these plans and their embedded policy targets will lower the country’s projected emission pathway and improve its policies rating. Thailand has revised its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy after the submission of its Second NDC."
Thailand,Policies and action  against fair share,Critically insufficient,"Thailand has announced several major policies aiming at increasing climate ambition and sustainable development in recent years but is off track in achieving its climate targets and shows little indication of implementation progress towards Paris-compatibility. We rate Thailand’s policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Thailand has plans to expand renewable energy generation, reduce energy intensity of energy sub-sectors, move towards 100% EV sales starting in 2035, and continue expansion of carbon sinks in the forestry sector. The government has also announced its preparation of a Climate Change Act , the drafting of the National Energy Plan, which is expected to provide a low-carbon roadmap towards 2050, and a possible revision of its 20-year National Strategy and National Economic and Social Development Plan to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These documents will strengthen climate governance and enhance renewable share targets, but would not be ambitious enough for 1.5°-compatibility. Thailand’s current and planned policies fall significantly short of any criteria for 1.5°C-compatibility, and result in an increase in domestic emissions towards 2030. Thailand’s recent shift in power sector planning from a dependency on coal to fossil gas over the next two decades lowers overall emission pathways but nevertheless exacerbates fossil fuel (gas) lock-in, and delays meaningful decarbonisation efforts. Institutional and system planning barriers for renewables remain high, leading to projections of slow growth in clean energy development. We rate Thailand’s policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Thailand’s emissions rise in both its current and planned policy projections and is significantly off track when compared to its fair share trajectory. If all countries were to follow Thailand’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. The government needs to implement more stringent policies, for which it will also need additional support."
Thailand,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"We rate Thailand’s 2030 conditional targets as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. For Thailand’s target to be in line with 1.5 °C, its conditional NDC commitment would need to be a 65% reduction below the same BAU."
Thailand,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Critically insufficient,"We rate Thailand’s unconditional NDC target “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Thailand’s unconditional targets remain based on an inflated BAU that is significantly higher than its current and planned policy projections, even before the onset of COVID-19 or the global energy crisis. Economic trends post-pandemic now lend even more weight to the possibility that the BAU is unrealistic and should be revised downward, with a corresponding strengthening of its emissions reduction targets. If all countries were to follow Thailand ’s current approach, warming would exceed 4°C. For Thailand’s unconditional target to be in line with 1.5 °C, its NDC commitment would need to be an unconditional 57% reduction below the same BAU."
Thailand,Land use & forestry,Sink,"Thailand recorded a large LULUCF sink in its latest inventory equivalent to around 20% of its emissions. Thailand should work toward maintaining this sink. For more information about forestry activities in Thailand, please see the policies & action section ."
Thailand,Net zero target,Average,"We rate Thailand’s net zero target as Average. In Thailand’s Second NDC , it references its continuing efforts “to meet the long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2065”. This supersedes Thailand’s previous ‘carbon neutrality’ target for 2065 target submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2021. Thailand officially submitted these revised targets as part of its new long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy (LT-LEDS) on 7 November 2022."
Switzerland,Overview,no rating,"Switzerland has made notable strides in its climate policies since the last update, first with the introduction of a legally binding 2050 net zero target and more recently with the passage of the Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies, which gives significant support to renewable energy development and end-use electrification. But despite this progress, the Swiss government has shown a concerning unwillingness to address the implications of the recent European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling, which underscored Switzerland’s inadequate ambition of climate policies and failure to meet necessary emission targets. This non compliance is problematic because it undermines international efforts to combat climate change and sets a concerning precedent for other countries that might be tempted to undermine similar rulings. Switzerland has yet to communicate how much of its NDC target it plans to achieve through domestic reductions versus offsets abroad. Switzerland’s engagement in bilateral agreements to “offset” part of its domestic emissions and the lack of transparency around the level of domestic emissions reduction effort in its NDC continue to risk setting a bad precedent for other countries. These actions raise concerns about the country's willingness and ability to take ambitious domestic climate action that will be needed to meet Switzerland’s legally binding net zero target. The Climate Action Tracker continues to rate Switzerland overall as “Insufficient”. The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies adopted in June 2024 will substantially reduce Switzerland’s emissions towards 2030, contributing to our assessment of Switzerland’s policy projection and action now rated as ""Almost Sufficient"". The legislation includes plans to increase generation of non-hydro renewable energy more than seven-fold between 2023 and 2035. This increase is crucial for the clean electrification of other sectors. As a result, emissions are projected to decrease substantially, getting Switzerland on track to meet CAT’s estimated domestic NDC target for Switzerland while almost reaching its full NDC target including international carbon credits. This implies less need for Switzerland to offset emissions abroad. In its NDC, Switzerland states that it will reduce emissions at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2030, but Switzerland has not set a domestic component for this target, also not in the 2030 NDC update submitted in November 2024. The CAT estimates that 60% to 66% of these reductions are expected to be met domestically but if Switzerland wants to improve its overall rating to ""Almost sufficient”, it needs to establish a robust domestic target for 2030 which needs to lie at around 75% of the total NDC target. However, this only brings Switzerland’s contribution to one that is consistent with pathways for below 2°C. In order to be 1.5° compatible, the NDC target needs to be lowered, and achieved entirely domestically. For the remaining, non-disclosed, share of its NDC target, Switzerland plans to rely on international carbon credits. Using international credits in place of cutting domestic emissions risks undermining the ambition of the Swiss target. Additionally the lack of transparency on the amount of emissions it aims to compensate hinders the assessment of the overall ambition of its emission reduction strategy. Switzerland should therefore first aim to deliver deep reductions domestically and support developing countries through providing and mobilising climate finance, instead of purchasing carbon credits which it counts against its targets. Switzerland is one of the most active countries in pursuing bilateral agreements to purchase so-called Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under the Paris Agreement, and has been criticised for its low level of ambition. In summary, Switzerland’s recent climate policy developments reveal significant advancements but also critical gaps that it must address to align with the latest science and the urgent need for accelerating ambition. Key positive developments: Legally binding 2050 net zero target: Switzerland's Climate Protection Act established a legally binding target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, creating a clear framework for long-term climate action and necessary policy adjustments. Based on improvements in scope, architecture, and transparency, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) now rates Switzerland’s net zero target as ""acceptable"" instead of ""average"". New Renewable Energy Act: The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies will significantly increase the share of renewables in Switzerland's energy mix and is expected to lead to a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in an “Almost sufficient” rating for the country’s climate policies. Legal framework following ECHR ruling: The European Court of Human Rights ruling in April 2024 highlighted the necessity for effective climate policies, prompting the Swiss government to take more action. Although the government dismissed the ECHR's findings, the ruling raised awareness and intensified the debate around Switzerland's climate strategy. Areas for improvement: Need for a robust domestic emissions reduction target that is aligned with the national 2050 net zero goal: Switzerland currently lacks a domestic emission reduction target, which significantly undermines the credibility of its climate action towards 2030 and beyond. To achieve an overall ""Almost sufficient"" rating, Switzerland must reduce at least 75% of the emissions reductions set in the NDC target domestically, and it must transparently communicate this and put it into law. In order to be 1.5°C compatible, however, Switzerland needs to lower its NDC target and deliver all emissions reductions within its borders. Better enhance international cooperation: Switzerland should continue its efforts to cooperate with other countries to support emissions reductions outside of its borders. However, it should prioritise its fair share of climate finance to developing countries ahead of engaging in deals to transfer mitigation outcomes from other countries to offset Switzerland's own high emissions. It should only embark on such cooperative approaches, involving a transfer of mitigation outcomes from other countries, once it has set a domestic emissions reduction target in line with the 1.5°C temperature limit and provided its fair share of climate finance."
Switzerland,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Switzerland,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Switzerland’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Switzerland does not specify the domestic component of the 2030 emissions reduction target. Based on our estimations, the domestic target would be rated “Insufficient” with keeping warming below 2°C. To improve its rating, Switzerland should set a domestic target that accounts for at least 75% of the anticipated emissions reductions under the NDC target. If fully implemented, Switzerland’s current policies and actions would be rated “Almost sufficient”, meaning that they are consistent with keeping warming below ­– but not well below – 2°C. This would be enough to achieve CAT’s estimated domestic target."
Switzerland,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"Switzerland’s efforts to tackle climate change are heading in the right direction, since passing the new Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energy in June 2024.. Under current policies, we estimate that Switzerland will reach emission levels of around 28 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), reaching CAT’s estimated domestic NDC target for Switzerland of 35-38 MtCO 2 e. The CAT rates Switzerland’s current policies as “Almost Sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s climate policies and action until 2030 are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach below—but not well below— 2°C . The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Switzerland,NDC target (domestic) against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"In its updated NDC, Switzerland removed the domestic emissions reduction component but continues to mention that an undefined portion of emission reductions will be achieved through the support of action abroad and transfer of the ownership of the associated mitigation outcomes. Switzerland first aimed at achieve 75% of the emissions reductions of the NDC target (which is 50% reductions by 2030 below 1990) domestically, and later reduced this number to 66% in Swiss legislation and draft law documents, but finally removed it completely in the last version. Based on latest available information the CAT assesses that the Swiss government aims for domestic reduction of at least 60% to 67% of the full emissions reduction target. The domestic component’s removal from official documents and the ambition reduction of the domestic reduction component make it challenging to hold Switzerland accountable and raises questions about the sincerity of Switzerland's climate commitments. To rate Switzerland’s NDC, we use a range for the domestic component between 60% and 67% of the full target, which we rate as “Insufficient” when compared to global least cost modelled pathways. To be rated “Almost Sufficient”, this component would need to be at least 75%. Switzerland’s domestic component of the NDC rating against modelled domestic pathways has deteriorated compared to our previous assessment due to an update in our modelled domestic pathways to the pathways assessed in the IPPC AR6. Our newer pathways better capture national circumstances and for higher temperature levels show less room for emissions growth."
Switzerland,NDC target (full) against fair share,Insufficient,"The CAT’s assessment of the Switzerland’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. Switzerland’s has clearly stated that a portion of emission reductions will be achieved through the support of action abroad facilitated through cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The overall target is a reduction of “at least” 50% below 1990 levels by 2030. We rate the overall target, which includes its recent bilateral agreements with over 10 countries to purchase Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s fair share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Some of these improvements should be made by increasing the ambition in the domestic target itself, whilst others could come in the form of providing climate finance to support additional emissions reductions in developing countries, without any transfer of ownership for these outcomes. If all countries followed Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C. If we were to rate Switzerland’s estimated domestic target against its fair share, assuming that the bilateral agreements do not lead to an overall mitigation effect, the target would be “Highly insufficient”."
Switzerland,Climate finance,Insufficient,"We rate Switzerland’s international public climate finance contributions as ‘Insufficient’. Switzerland has committed to increasing its climate finance and has steadily increased its spending leading to USD 411m public finance contributions in 2020. Nonetheless, this is lower than what would be required under its fair share. To improve its rating, Switzerland needs to ramp up its international climate finance contributions in the period post-2020."
Switzerland,Net zero target,Acceptable,"Switzerland committed to a 2050 net-zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021. The net-zero target now covers key elements and meets best practice standards for many of them. The CAT evaluates the net-zero target design as ""Acceptable"". The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
South Korea,Overview,no rating,"A change of government in South Korea has seen a shift in climate policies away from the government’s previous target of 100% renewables, which new President Yoon Suk-yeol has stated are “too expensive”. Instead, he has revitalised the nuclear power program, reversing his predecessor’s announced phase-out of nuclear power. South Korea’s climate change mitigation and energy sector planning still lacks the necessary speed and stringency it needs to get onto a pathway compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The January 2023 10 th Basic Electricity Plan passed in January 2023 proposes revising the targets for the country's electricity mix by 2030 and 2036, aiming for more nuclear than previous targets, at the cost of renewable energy, while its targeted share of coal and LNG are similar. While this change has a limited effect on 2030 emission levels, the deprioritisation of renewable energy hampers a transition towards a 1.5°C pathway. To be Paris Agreement-compatible, coal needs to be phased-out by 2030 at the latest, and gas phased out from the power sector shortly after. In 2021, the share of coal-fired power generation further decreased to 35%, from above 40% over the last decade and from 36% in 2020. The use of renewable energy only increased slightly; more notable is an increase in fossil gas-based electricity production, at 31% of electricity. Nuclear electricity generation decreased slightly in the same year. South Korea’s December 2021 NDC sets an emissions reduction target of 40% below 2018 levels by 2030, a significant improvement on the previous NDC of 24.4% below 2017 levels, but does not improve the overall CAT rating of “Highly insufficient”. Deducting the suggested contribution of forestry and reductions overseas, the target translates into a 32% reduction of domestic emissions by 2030, compared to 2018. To meet the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit, the CAT estimates that a domestic emissions reduction of at least 59% by 2030 is needed. After taking office on May 2022, South Korea’s new government is continuing its efforts to advance the implementation of its carbon neutrality target, evaluated as “average” by the CAT. The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth enshrines carbon-neutrality by 2050 into law. Following the Framework Act, in October 2021 South Korea released sectoral roadmaps with possible policy measures. If those roadmaps were implemented, they would also lead to emissions reductions before 2030 and decrease the CAT projections under policies and action."
South Korea,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates South Korea’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. The domestic component of South Korea’s 2030 target is rated “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries pursued this level of ambition, it would lead to up to 3°C of warming. To achieve its target, South Korea would need to enhance its policies and action, which are rated “Highly insufficient” and are currently only compatible with up to 4°C of warming compared to modelled domestic pathways. We rate South Korea’s NDC target including the emissions reductions abroad as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. South Korea should also significantly increase the domestic component of its emissions reduction target, to get on a 1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible pathway."
South Korea,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"We rate South Korea’s policies and action as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. In March 2023, the Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth released its first basic plan. 2030’s sectoral emission reduction target of the NDC was changed but the overall reduction target remains the same. The plan marks growing reliance on overseas reduction (from 33.5 Mt to 37.5 Mt), various hydrogen (from 7.6 to 8.4 Mt) and CCUS (10.3 to 11.2 Mt). The industrial sector reduction target was reduced to 11%, which previously set at 14.5% in 2021 (37.9 Mt to 29.8 Mt) (MOE, 2023). In January 2023, the government passed its Tenth Electricity Plan, which aims to increase the renewable electricity share to 21.6% by 2030, up from around 6% in 2020 (IEA, 2021c), while nuclear power would rise to 32.8%, and coal would drop to 21.2% (MOTIE, 2022b). South Korea’s current share of renewables in its power mix is the lowest in the OECD (Schneider et al., 2022a). Compared to previous plans, the Tenth Electricity Plan aims for a slower growth of renewable energy, and instead priorities nuclear energy. The government plans to extend the lifetime of ten nuclear power plants by 2030 (MOLIT, 2022). Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO 2 , the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs (compared to alternatives such as renewables), long construction times, incompatibility with a flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, and its vulnerability to heat waves. The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is the main policy instrument for promoting renewable energy in South Korea. The RPS scheme mandates major electricity utilities to increase renewable and “new energy” share of the electricity mix to 10% by 2030 (Korea New and Renewable Energy Center, 2019). However, the new tenth electricity plan will include lowering the RPS ratio to 13% in 2023 (previously set at 14.5%) and to gradually increase it to 15% and 25% in 2026 and 2030 respectively (Renewables Now, 2023). The revised Renewable Energy Act, passed in March 2021, raised the share of renewables at 25% by 2034. This law will support South Korea in achieving its renewable energy targets, however this is still insufficient to put the country on a 1.5°C compatible pathway (Renewables Now, 2023). The new government has announced its intention to shut down 20 coal power plants by 2030 through the carbon neutral green growth vision and promotion strategy, but also plans to convert 26 coal-fired power plants (13.7 GW) to run on gas (LNG). Furthermore, additional five LNG power plants will be running, to secure 4.3 GW. In 2021, MOTIE stated that hydrogen and ammonia will play an integral role in achieving South Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality target. The government sets 13.8-21.5% country’s electricity generation to be sourced from hydrogen and ammonia-fueled turbines by 2050, replacing power generation from coal and LNG. The government estimated to finalise 50% of 150 MW class hydrogen co-firing test by 2028 while demonstration of 20% ammonia co-firing will be completed by 2027. In April 2021 at the U.S. Leaders’ Summit on Climate, South Korea announced it will immediately stop financing coal projects abroad (Wang et al., 2021). However, just one month later, it announced exceptions for retrofitting, CCS, and approved projects. Despite this backpedaling, major Korean financial groups like KB, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, have all announced plans to make their investment portfolios carbon neutral by 2050. According to SFOC’s (Solution for Our Climate, 2022) analysis, 70 out of the top 100 South Korean financial institutions have announced they will phase out coal, yet just only a fraction of them have set up actual policies; showing there is still much work to be done around such investment decisions. South Korea joined the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to reduce methane emissions by 30% below 2018 levels (Climate & Clean Air Coalition, 2022). Joining the Global Methane Pledge, South Korea announced a methane reduction plan that included a national target to reduce emissions from 28 MtCO 2 e 2018 to 19.7 MtCO 2 e in 2030, a 30% reduction (IEA, 2022). If implemented, this would be a reduction of about 10 MtCO 2 e in 2030 below the CAT projections for policies and action. In 2020, South Korea had announced to increase the coverage of the Korea Energy Trading System (K-ETS) from 68% of national GHG emissions to 73.5%. As a result, almost 80% of CO 2 emissions from energy use in 2021 were covered. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
South Korea,NDC target (domestic) against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"We rate the domestic component of South Korea’s NDC target for 2030 as “Insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s domestic target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C."
South Korea,NDC target (full) against fair share,Highly insufficient,"We rate South Korea’s overall NDC target (including the domestic and the international element) as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s fair share target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. The CAT rates the full target, including South Korea’s proposed procurement of carbon credits from other countries, as “Highly Insufficient” when compared to South Korea’s fair share. This assessment of South Korea’s target does not, at present, question the quality of the credits procured from abroad, and we were unable to identify sufficient information to examine this element of its NDC. As such our analysis may overestimate the mitigation impact of South Korea’s target."
South Korea,Net zero target,Average,"We evaluate the net zero target as “Average”. The target is enshrined in law through the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth, which was passed in August 2021 and enforced in March 2022. Over the course of 2022, the government has further advanced the enforcement of the legal framework around the target and has taken steps towards more detailed sectoral planning in the form of the Carbon Neutral Green Growth Vision and Implementation Strategy. The strategy includes launching of the 2050 Carbon Neutral Green Growth Committee and the carbon-neutral green growth promotion strategies; (responsible carbon neutrality, innovation, cooperation and adaptation), and technology innovation strategies; (R&D investment system, carbon neutral technological by private sector, institutional support) which aim to achieve the 2030 NDC and the 2050 carbon neutrality target. The net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, it lacks clarity on emissions coverage and detail in the government’s review process."
South Africa,Overview,no rating,"South Africa's energy system remains at a crossroads: as its energy crisis continues, it is moving forward with the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP), and is in the process of adopting a renewable energy plan. However, it is continuing to pursue controversial fossil gas capacity and potentially faces delays in its shift away from its heavy coal reliance as it props up its failing state-owned electricity company ESKOM. Uncertainty remains in the future of South Africa’s power sector as the government has not yet presented an updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The Presidential Climate Committee (PCC) has recommended renewables and battery storage as least cost options and the full phase-out of coal, but leaves the potential role of gas an open question that requires more research while the government continues to pursue new fossil gas capacity. Further, South Africa has presented its JET IP; however, the energy crisis threatens delays to decommissioning coal plants. Accelerating the rollout of renewables could close the capacity gap to allow South Africa to stay on track. Market indicators point to rapidly increasing renewables deployment with the import of solar cells, panels and modules hitting record highs in the first half of 2023. Overall, the CAT continues to rate South Africa’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The energy crisis in South Africa has continued to worsen with 2023 reaching record-breaking load shedding, impacting the economy as well as the everyday lives of South Africans. Several of the measures passed by President Ramaphosa, such as the removal of the licencing threshold to unlock investment in distributed generation, have seen success. Government efforts to reform Eskom, South Africa’s public utility, are ongoing, with a new plan to provide debt relief for Eskom equivalent to over half of the company’s debt over the next three years to enable investment and maintenance of the power system. While renewables deployment has been slow, bid windows for new renewable capacity continue to attract investment, with solar dominating Bid Window 6. This includes one of the world’s largest solar and battery facilities, on which construction began in July 2022. Renewables have also been successful in ‘technology-neutral’ procurement rounds. While gas made up the majority of energy procured under the Risk Mitigation Power Purchase Programme (RMPPP), so far only three hybrid solar and storage projects totalling 150 MW have started construction with controversial gas capacity procured facing delays due to concerns and court challenges over procurement and licensing irregularities. South Africa has advanced several positive climate policies and measures: In October 2023, South Africa’s National Assembly approved the Climate Change Bill, which still needs approval from the National Council of Provinces and the President. If passed, the Bill would be a significant step forward for South Africa, making its NDC legally binding, requiring the government to set sectoral emission targets and to allocate carbon budgets to significant GHG emitting companies. South Africa presented the JET IP in November 2022, which details financing needs of USD 98bn over the next five years for catalysing a sustained just energy transition. The JET IP further outlines how best to direct the initial offer of USD 8.5bn from donor countries to priority investment areas. The majority of the initial offer will go to the power sector, supporting a transition away from coal and including support for impacted coal workers, with investments also in new energy vehicles, primarily battery electric vehicles, and green hydrogen. South Africa is using the JET IP to discuss additional funding with other donors, with recent commitments from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain adding USD 3.5bn to the pot in September 2023. A more comprehensive implementation plan is expected to be launched in November 2023. South Africa is also aiming to develop value chains for renewable energy and storage technologies through the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), released for public comment in July 2023, with a focus on driving industrial development and creating inclusive jobs. In August 2021, the government changed the licencing threshold for new generation from 1 MW to 100 MW, and, in December 2022, completely removed it. According to the government’s estimates, the pipeline of private sector embedded generation capacity has grown to more than 10 GW, though it is unclear how much of this is renewable capacity. While there has been progress on procuring renewables and removing barriers to private participation, transitioning away from fossil fuels still faces challenges. To meet its ambitions for a just energy transition, South Africa could: Follow the guidance of the PCC and pursue a low-cost renewables-based electricity system. While PCC recommendations on the role of fossil gas remain unclear, all least-cost models reviewed by the PCC add no new coal or nuclear due to high costs and a transition to more affordable renewables with co-located storage. Accelerate the decommissioning of coal and set an ambitious phase out plan for coal power plants incorporated into key national plans including the finalised JET IP and updated IRP. New coal capacity additions are not cost-effective or compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5ºC. Recent CAT analysis shows South Africa needs to cut its coal power reliance significantly by 2030 and phase it out by 2040. Frontload assistance to coal communities who are most affected by the coal phase out to ensure a smooth and just transition for affected groups, building capacity and necessary administrative infrastructure, and setting out clear and predictable plans. Prioritise urgent investments in transmission and distribution . As specified in the JET IP, investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure is critical to ensure uptake of private sector-driven deployment of renewable energy. Grid infrastructure will need additional, external support in the form of concessional finance and budget assistance. Improve policy certainty to support investment and implementation by accelerating the adoption of several important draft policies and laws , including the Climate Change Bill, the Renewable Energy Master Plan, the updated IRP, and the Electricity Regulator Act Amendment Bill."
South Africa,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates South Africa’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. South Africa’s updated 2030 emissions reduction target is rated as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways, and “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. South Africa’s targets and policies are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C. If fully implemented, South Africa’s current policies would be consistent with more than 3°C warming if all other countries followed a similar level of ambition. The updated 2030 emissions reduction target submitted to the UNFCCC in September 2021 follows the Presidential Climate Commission recommending 350-420 MtCO 2 e (incl. LULUCF). South Africa’s 2030 NDC target has a range, of which we rate the upper end, because reaching that would comply with the NDC."
South Africa,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"We rate South Africa’s current policies and actions as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Under current policies, South Africa will not reduce emissions enough to meet its NDC target range for 2030. Despite a range of measures announced in July 2022, the energy crisis has persisted in South Africa with load-shedding reaching record highs. Additional measures are being taken to reform the power sector, including the government taking over some of Eskom’s debt, and procurement processes for renewables and controversial fossil gas capacity are ongoing. The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP), presented in November 2022, indicates the power sector will receive the bulk of the USD 8.5 bn investment package from donor countries. However, the Governments of South Africa and the donor countries have expressed concerns that the plans under the agreement to retire coal plants may be delayed amid the ongoing energy crisis. An update to the Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) is expected this year but has already faced delays. However, this has not stopped the private sector from investing in renewables – the country hit a new solar investment record in 2023, importing over USD 650m in solar cells, panels and modules in the first half of 2023, up from USD 345m in all of 2022. The pending IRP update could build on this momentum from the private sector to accelerate renewables. To take advantage of increasing domestic and international demand for renewable and storage technologies, the government released the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM) for public comment in July 2023. The plan aims to develop industrial value chains for these technologies to drive development and create inclusive jobs. If considering South Africa’s planned but not yet implemented policies, our rating of policies and actions would go up to “1.5°C compatible”. The stringent implementation of proposed economy-wide and sector-specific policy measures would enable South Africa to achieve at least the top end of its NDC target range, falling within the current range. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
South Africa,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate the updated 2030 reduction target levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s NDC in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. The CAT rates South Africa’s reduction target based on the upper range of its target, which falls in the “Almost sufficient” range, even if close to the limit to “1.5°C compatible”. If South Africa were to meet the lower end of the range it would be 1.5°C compatible when compared to modelled emissions pathways; however, it would still fall short of its fair-share contribution. South Africa currently relies on foreign investments and international finance support to implement a large percentage of its climate change programmes, and the government also emphasises in its updated NDC that the implementation of its NDC will be enabled by financial support as specified in the Paris Agreement."
South Africa,NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate South Africa’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. CAT interprets the full NDC target as unconditional. As South Africa only needs to reach the upper end of the target range to fulfil the NDC, we rate that emissions level. If South Africa committed to meeting the lower end of its target range, the rating would change to “Almost sufficient” when compared to the fair share contribution."
South Africa,Net zero target,Information incomplete,The CAT currently does not evaluate South Africa’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.
Singapore,Overview,no rating,"Despite increasing ambition with its updated climate plan (NDC) of 2022, setting numerous sectoral targets and making strides towards several of its key climate policies, Singapore’s emissions continue to rise. While Singapore’s current 2030 target is an improvement on its predecessor, it is still 131% higher than 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. Combined with the fact that Singapore is already projected to overachieve its 2030 target, this makes a strong case for increasing ambition in its forthcoming NDC update. The CAT rates Singapore’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient” overall, an improvement on its previous ""Critically insufficient"" rating. Singapore’s recent policy developments on clean energy have been promising. Most notable among these is the SGD 5bn Future Energy Fund announced in the 2024 budget. Singapore is also on-track to meet its target of importing 4 GW of “low carbon” electricity by 2035, which is expected to meet approximately 30% of domestic demand. However, in parallel, Singapore is also doubling down on fossil gas, which currently provides around 94% of the country’s electricity generation. Singapore plans to expand both LNG imports and gas-fired generation capacity to meet the country’s growing electricity demand. It also aims to become the world’s largest LNG bunkering hub, to service an assumed growth in Asia’s LNG demand. Fossil gas needs to rapidly decline, and eventually be phased out with no new investments if we are to stay below the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement. The country’s carbon tax, covering about 80% of total emissions in 2023, was increased to SGD 25/tCO 2 e (USD 19/tCO 2 e) in 2024 as planned and will be increased to SGD 50–80/tCO 2 e (USD 38-60/tCO 2 e) by 2030. However, a much higher carbon price would be required to generate the incentives needed for a large-scale switch to zero carbon technology. Several positive developments are worth highlighting, while noting that Singapore’s climate policies are yet to translate into a downwards emission trajectory: Singapore is rapidly expanding its solar capacity, where, given the country’s small land area and high population density, floating solar panels play an important role. The government targets 1.5 GW of installed capacity by 2025 and at least 2 GW by 2030. As of end 2023, solar PV had reached 1.17 GW installed capacity Singapore has introduced numerous sectoral policies with mitigation measures and/or targets proposed in electricity supply, industry, buildings, transport, and waste In its addendum to its long-term strategy (LT-LEDS), Singapore brought forward its net zero target year to 2050 from ‘as soon as viable in the second half of the century’ Emissions under current policies are expected to continue rising towards 2030, despite a brief dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic and contrary to what is needed to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal. To reverse its emissions upward trend, Singapore could: Increase the ambition of its 2030 climate target consistent with 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways, especially considering that Singapore is already projected to overachieve its current 2030 target. Accelerate its transition away from fossil gas by further exploring energy efficiency measures to temper its rapidly-growing electricity demand and pursuing its plans to become a regional hub for storage, trade, and transportation of green hydrogen. Go further than its domestic target by increasing finance and support for decarbonisation and renewable energy projects in the region. Double down on regional renewable energy collaboration and imports , instead of fossil gas. While CAT modelled domestic pathways do not reflect Singapore’s particularly low domestic RE potential, these pathways do reflect the rapid decarbonisation in the Southeast Asian region that Singapore should follow, if not lead. Given its context, Singapore can play an even larger role in driving regional decarbonisation and energy collaboration."
Singapore,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Singapore,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates Singapore’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Singapore’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions. Singapore is far from meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Singapore’s NDC target is rated “Highly insufficient” compared to both its fair share and modelled domestic pathways. We rate Singapore’s policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Highly insufficient” as well. Singapore’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with 4°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. If fully implemented, Singapore’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its target, but still only in line with 4°C warming. To improve its rating, Singapore should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target and adopt policies necessary to reach this goal. Singapore’s overall rating has improved due to an update in our modelled domestic pathways to the national inventory dataset: it is not due to any fundamental changes in the target itself, nor the current policy projections."
Singapore,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Insufficient,"We rate Singapore’s policies and action as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Singapore’s policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Singapore’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Under current policies and action Singapore’s emissions will increase to 56-57 MtCO 2 e in 2030, which is under its 2030 target, but still not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Emissions in Singapore are dominated by the energy and industry sectors. The carbon tax, targeting upstream emissions from large emitters, was increased to SGD 25/tCO 2 e (USD 19/tCO 2 e) in 2024, up from 5 SGD/tCO 2 e (USD 4/tCO 2 e) in 2019. It is planned to increase the rate further to 45/tCO 2 e by 2026-2027, with a target of reaching SGD 50-80/tCO 2 e by 2030. Despite this improvement, the carbon tax is still far too low when compared to IPCC estimates for a 1.5°C compatible price. A tax at appropriate level could encourage more renewable energy in place of fossil fuel energy by adding a price for the emitted carbon. However, higher tax levels are needed to encourage a significant shift to decarbonising the power sector. While renewable energy capacity has expanded, fossil gas remains the dominant energy source in the power sector. Fossil gas accounted for more than 94% of generation in 2023, up from 18% in 2000 when electricity was primarily generated from fuel oil. Singapore does not have any hydrocarbon reserves, but petroleum refining, storage, and distribution infrastructure has historically been a significant part of its economy. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for 70% of the world’s LNG demand. Based on assumed growth in Asian LNG demand, Singapore is investing to remain the world’s largest LNG bunkering hub, now growing its business line to sell ‘other’ fuels such as LNG and biofuel, as well as maritime fuels. Singapore is forging ahead with electricity imports to meet its target of 4 GW of low carbon electricity imports by 2035. Several 100 MW import trials have started or are planned, and the Energy Market Authority has granted conditional approval to projects from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam, totalling 4.2 GW. Outside the power generation sector, Singapore’s mitigation efforts almost exclusively consist of measures aimed at improving energy efficiency through programmes like Green Mark standards for buildings, public transport, fuel efficiency standards, home appliance efficiency standards, industrial energy efficiency, and waste management. However, with a fossil fuel dependent energy mix, the effect of these policies on emissions is limited and does not compensate for the overall increase in energy demand. For more detail, see the policies and action section here ."
Singapore,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates Singapore's NDC target as ""Highly insufficient"" when rated against modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Singapore’s domestic target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Singapore’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. A stronger target is needed if Singapore is to follow its modelled domestic pathway. The government’s target of 60 MtCO 2 e by 2030, which is 30% above 2010 levels, is an improvement on the previous target of 65 MtCO 2 e by 2030. However, when compared against modelled domestic pathways Singapore’s NDC target is 131% higher than 1.5°C compatibility."
Singapore,NDC target against fair share,Highly insufficient,"Singapore’s emission levels under its NDC target are substantially higher than what would be deemed 1.5°C compatible compared to our “fair share” approach. The CAT rates Singapore's NDC target as ""Highly insufficient""when rated against its fair share contribution. Singapore’s NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C, and would require other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Singapore’s approach, warming would over 3°C and up to 4°C."
Singapore,Net zero target,Poor,"Singapore has committed to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 as part of its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which is an improvement on its previous loosely defined ‘as soon as viable in the second half of the century’. Singapore’s LT-LEDS includes information on sector-specific policies, but it does not provide details on the mitigation potential of those measures, define an emissions pathway to net zero, or outline the level of dependence on CCUS needed to achieve the target. CAT evaluates Singapore’s net zero target as Poor. Full details of the assessment can be found here ."
Saudi Arabia,Overview,no rating,"Note: We have updated the text assessment to reflect the latest policy developments in Saudi Arabia. The CAT’s ratings and data are from our 2023 evaluation and will be updated soon. Saudi Arabia has not implemented any policies that would substantially bring down its greenhouse gas emissions and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Previously-announced plans to cut emissions through expanding renewable energy are failing to materialise. Despite its “Vision 2030” diversification plan, initiated nearly a decade ago, the Saudi economy remains highly dependent on the production, use and export of hydrocarbons. As well as not mitigating greenhouse gas emissions nationally, Saudi Arabia is also playing an increasingly disruptive role in international climate negotiations. Most recently at COP29, Saudi Arabia’s interventions aimed at blocking discussion on a transition away from fossil fuels and at disconnecting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 7th Assessment Report from the 2nd Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. The country’s emissions are projected to continue increasing through 2030. As the world’s largest crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia is responsible for a significant share of global emissions, with emissions from burning exported oil in other countries amounting to more than twice the level of its domestic emissions . The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) rates Saudi Arabia’s overall climate action as “Critically Insufficient”. Saudi Arabia’s 2030 and 2060 climate commitments are not expected to help cut emissions: they lack transparency, rely largely on the deployment of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) technologies, and fail to address concerns about Saudi Arabia’s role as the world’s leading crude oil exporter. Its 2030 emissions reduction target is explicitly based on a scenario with substantial fossil fuel exports and includes a “get out clause” if international climate change policies negatively affect these exports. Our analysis suggests that this target could lead to national emissions ranging anywhere between 520–800 MtCO 2 e by 2030—going from a slight decrease in emissions to a significant increase compared to current levels due to uncertainties around the expected contribution of the land use and forestry sector. The Saudi government also announced a 2060 net zero target in 2021 but has yet to release any additional information on this objective, nor enshrine it into law, giving it little credibility. Despite its diversification plan, Saudi Arabia remains heavily dependent on oil revenues and has done little to effectively diversify towards a low carbon economy and adapt to a world heading to net zero emissions. In January 2024, the Saudi national oil company, Aramco, abandoned its plan to increase oil production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027 from currently 12 million barrels per day. However, this decision appears largely driven by strategic considerations rather than a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, reflecting changes in the global oil market, including slowing demand growth and increased production from non-OPEC countries. Saudi Arabia has the potential to become a world leader in renewable energy production, but has made very little progress in the last decade. The most recent target aims for 50% of electricity to be generated with renewable energy by 2030. However, in 2023, renewables only generated around 1% of electricity and Saudi Arabia had around 2.7 GW of installed renewable capacity. In contrast, it has 97 GW of oil and gas plants in operation along with a pipeline of more than 8 GW of fossil plants under construction as of August 2024. Saudi Arabia also has a track record of obstructing international climate negotiations by repeatedly opposing references to the 1.5°C warming limit and language related to the phase-out of fossil fuels. Notably, at COP29, Saudi Arabia had sought to undermine the pledge to transition away from fossil fuels agreed at COP28. This raises concerns about the country’s willingness to engage in meaningful climate action on the global stage. Saudi Arabia is already experiencing above-average temperature rise. Projections indicate that global warming will be more pronounced in the Middle East and North Africa region, with climate policies and actions around the world on course for warming in Saudi Arabia in the order of 4°C this century. To improve its climate action, Saudi Arabia should take the following steps: Develop a credible economic diversification plan away from fossil fuels, which is both compatible with the Paris Agreement and takes into account the risks associated with exporting fossil fuels in a world heading to net zero emissions. This plan should include a clear commitment to ending new investments in oil and gas production and a phase-out of fossil fuels in line with a 1.5°C scenario. Significantly increase the pace of renewable energy deployment, which would help drive decarbonisation efforts and stimulate sustainable job growth for its young population, all of which are objectives of the Vision 2030 agenda. Update its NDC by strengthening its 2030 target , providing an absolute emissions reduction target (instead of a reduction below an uncommunicated baseline scenario) and clarifying the assumptions on LULUCF. Clarify the assumptions behind its 2060 net zero target , which currently lacks transparency and credibility, and does not provide a clear emissions reduction pathway."
Saudi Arabia,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Saudi Arabia,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Saudi Arabia’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. This rating indicates that Saudi Arabia’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Saudi Arabia’s 2030 climate commitment is unclear, as the government has not published the baseline corresponding to its Paris Agreement target. We rate Saudi Arabia’s 2030 emissions reduction target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action and is consistent with more than 4°C of warming. The 2030 target is rated as ‘Highly insufficient’ when compared to modelled domestic pathways, downscaled from global least-cost scenarios. Saudi Arabia’s policies could lead to its emissions peaking in the second half of this decade, but still only in line with 2°C to 3°C warming. Saudi Arabia still needs to strengthen its target for emissions reductions and implement additional policies to get a rating aligned to the Paris Agreement."

This rating indicates that Saudi Arabia’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Saudi Arabia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Saudi Arabia remains highly dependent on fossil fuel revenues and keeps pushing for false solutions such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the hope of extending the life of its extractive industry. The government has put forward several mitigation measures, but implementation has been slow, particularly in the renewable energy sector. Despite its vast solar energy resource, Saudi Arabia had only installed about 2.7 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2023, generating around 1% of total electricity.

If all countries were to follow Saudi Arabia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Saudi Arabia's NDC rating against modelled domestic pathways has deteriorated compared to our previous assessment, due to an update in our modelled domestic pathways to the pathways assessed in the AR6, and a significant change in historical emissions. The latest historical data show higher emissions in the energy and industry sectors, which were previously underreported. As a result, its NDC rating is no longer “Highly insufficient” and falls into the “Critically insufficient” range. Our newer pathways better capture national circumstances - including the recent plateauing in Saudi Arabia's emissions - and, for higher temperature levels, show less room for emissions growth than the previous set."

Saudi Arabia,Net zero target,Poor,"We evaluate the target as: Poor. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia’s net zero target for 2060 at the first Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021. However, the target has yet to be enshrined in law or in a policy document. Since its initial announcement in 2021, the Saudi government has not provided any further detailed information on scope, target architecture, or transparency. Saudi Arabia has not yet provided a clear emissions reduction pathway to net zero. The emission coverage remains unclear. The CAT currently assumes that only CO 2 emissions are covered given the lack of information."
Russian Federation,Overview,no rating,"Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has highlighted the need for the world to reduce demand for fossil fuels (fossil gas, oil, and coal) as the right response to both climate and energy crises. The full implications of the energy crisis are being felt globally, and the extent of their impact is uncertain. Russia’s efforts to tackle climate change remain very low. Its few relevant policies are unambitious or have an unclear expected effect on emissions. Russia’s existing policies indicate no real commitment to curb emissions. The CAT estimates that Russia can easily reach its updated NDC target from November 2020 with adopted policies and should therefore submit a stronger 2030 target. In September 2022, the Russian government provided more detail on its net zero GHG emissions target for 2060. The government assumes that by 2050 forests would take up twice as much carbon as they do today, which means that all other emissions do not really have to reach zero, but only need to be cut by in half to reach the overall net zero target. No information substantiates such an enormous increase of carbon take-up. It also doesn’t appear to address the impact of enormous wildfires in its Siberian forests in recent years. In 2021, Russia adopted its law aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions, having gutted it of all measures that would have resulted in substantive emissions reductions. The Energy Strategy to 2035, adopted in 2021, focuses almost exclusively on promoting fossil fuel extraction, consumption, and exports to the rest of the world. Such a strong focus on increasing reliance on fossil fuel revenues poses a considerable economic risk in a future compatible with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit. Russia’s lack of any substantial contribution to international climate finance goals, together with its highly insufficient domestic target and climate policies result in the CAT giving Russia an overall rating of “Critically Insufficient”."
Russian Federation,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Russia’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Russia failed to increase its ambition when it submitted its NDC update in November 2020. We rate the updated NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. It is also not providing adequate climate finance, which we rate as “Critically insufficient”. The weak target will be easily met under existing policies and action, which we rate as “Highly insufficient”. Russia needs to set a more ambitious target for emissions reductions, adopt and implement additional policies, and provide additional finance to improve its CAT rating."
Russian Federation,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"Russia’s efforts to tackle climate change are deficient. Under current policies, Russia’s economy-wide emissions are expected to continue rising to 2030, when they should be rapidly declining, especially for such a large emitter. The CAT rates Russia’s current policies as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s policies and actions are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. In June 2021 Russia adopted its heavily watered-down climate bill that, unlike the original iteration of the legislation, does not enforce emissions quotas or impose penalties on large GHG emitters. Instead, it simply requires companies to report their emissions starting from 2024. Considerable uncertainty remains in Russia’s renewable energy sector, with no targets in place beyond its very modest renewable electricity generation target of 4.5% (excluding hydropower) by 2024 that it will not achieve. In the transport sector, Russia has taken steps to promote the production and purchase of EVs as well as reduce transport emissions. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Russian Federation,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"We rate Russia’s 2030 NDC target of a 30% reduction below 1990 levels by 2030 as being “Highly insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s domestic target in 2030 is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C."
Philippines,Overview,no rating,"The Philippines is currently revising its energy sector plan and extending its planning horizon to 2050 and can use this opportunity to further increase the focus on renewables. The country is set to overachieve its unconditional target while increasing emissions further without additional action, but its ambitious “1.5°C global least cost” compatible conditional target requires strong reductions far beyond current policies. The Philippines will need international support to meet this target and fully decarbonise its economy. We rate the Philippines mitigation targets and action “Insufficient” overall. On the other hand, the Philippines’ fossil gas expansion plans, continued reliance on coal power and potential nuclear revival expose it to energy security and stranded asset risks, reduced resilience against climate change impacts, high power bills and a whole host of social and environment impacts. Recent developments in the Philippines include: Plans to open at least three LNG terminals in 2023, with more in the pipeline, as the country seeks to shore up its fossil gas supply as its sole domestic field will be depleted in a few years. Fossil gas investments seem misplaced, considering the opportunity to focus on rapidly accelerating renewable energy as a cleaner, cheaper alternative that can support energy security. A major oil spill in February 2023 has wreaked havoc on its southwest coastline, and has increased awareness amongst local groups concerned that the country’s fossil gas expansion plans increase the risk of more destruction in the future. Launching of its second Green Energy Auction, which brings the combined total of auctioned renewables capacity to 13.6 GW or 52% of total electric capacity installed as of 2026, and should put the country on track for its current renewables targets. An additional auction is planned for later this year. Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development. The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth. The moratorium from 2020 allowed coal power plants that were in the pipeline at the time to move forward, which means that 2.6 GW of coal capacity will still come online by 2025. Coal will remain the dominant source of electricity generation for 2030 following current policy. The government needs to focus on accelerating the renewable energy future and implementing a coal and fossil gas phase out plan."
Philippines,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates the Philippines’ climate targets and policies as “Insufficient” . The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. To get a better rating, the Philippines needs to improve its unconditional target and implement more stringent policies, with some international support."
Philippines,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate the Philippines’ current policies and action as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution. The Philippines would need to implement additional policies to be 1.5°C compatible, and will need international support to do so. Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO 2 e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO 2 e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP. The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020). Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation."
Philippines,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,1.5°C global least cost,"The Philippines is one of the few developing countries that put forward an ambitious conditional target that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways and which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compatible. Due to the limited historical responsibility and capability of the Philippines, it will need substantial international support to be able to meet this target."
Philippines,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Insufficient,"The Philippines’ unconditional NDC target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO 2 e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO 2 e lower than it currently is. We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target to be 384 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF), which we rate as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ unconditional NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C."
Philippines,Land use & forestry,Sink,"The actual emissions and/or removal levels for the Philippine forestry sector are highly uncertain. Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO 2 /yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO 2 e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO 2 /yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss."
Philippines,Net zero target,No target,The Philippines does not have a net zero target.
Peru,Overview,no rating,"Peru’s progress in advancing climate policy has been slow. Since his election in July 2021, President Pedro Castillo’s government has been in turmoil: he has been twice impeached and has changed his ministerial cabinet five times , adding to the sense of political instability in the country, and slowing policy development overall. The share of renewable energy in Peru continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. The government is preparing for two more renewable auctions, and this year, it has agreed to implement the country’s first green hydrogen project. However, this year the government also approved a new license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset, located in the middle of the Amazon region, comprising about 500,000 ha. It holds 127 million barrels of proven reserves. According a study from the IEA , any new investment in oil and gas is incompatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in oil extraction not only risk becoming stranded assets but are at odds with the upcoming Climate Change National Strategy which is expected to include a net zero target for 2050. Furthermore, earlier this year, Peru phased its worst environmental disaster on the coastline when over 10,000 barrels were spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. The Land use, Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector continues to represent the biggest source of emissions in the country, and in 2021, the National Forest Programme reported the highest deforestation rate in the last two decades. The largest share of deforestation is due to illegal activity, but migration back to rural areas as a result of the pandemic also played a role. COP26 called for more ambitious NDCs to help close the emissions gap. Peru has not yet submitted an update to its 2020 NDC, although it current NDC is rated “Insufficient”. Peru signed the methane pledge and Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use at COP26; these sectoral initiatives should be reflected in a more ambitious NDC to take the additional efforts into account."
Peru,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Peru’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Peru’s 2030 emission reduction targets would lead to a 3°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways and its fair share contribution to climate action. If fully implemented, Peru’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its unconditional target, but still only in line with —and not well below—2°C based on Peru’s fair share."
Peru,Policies and action  against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"Our analysis shows that Peru could achieve its unconditional NDC target with its current policies, without the need for additional, more ambitious policies. Peru’s current policies are “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Peru’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Peru’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Peru is expected to implement additional policies with its own resources but will also need international support to take additional climate action beyond its fair share. Peru’s emissions, excluding LULUCF, have almost doubled, from about 54 MtCO 2 e in 1990 to 102 MtCO 2 e in 2021. We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO 2 e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels. In July 2022, the government approved the license contract for Peru's most important oil extraction asset . This same year, Peru agreed to the implementation of the country’s first green hydrogen project , with a pilot phase producing up to 55 tonnes of hydrogen per day and requiring 160 MW of renewable capacity.

Peru,Net zero target,Information incomplete,"Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government."
Norway,Overview,no rating,"In its latest NDC updated in November 2022, Norway slightly strengthened its 2030 emissions target to a reduction of at least 55% below 1990 levels, which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compared against modelled domestic pathways as being the minimum level of mitigation Norway should achieve within its borders. Considerably stronger policies will be needed to meet this target. A significant boost to committed climate finance for developing nations is a welcome outcome, but Norway’s climate finance is still “Insufficient"". There is also much still to do domestically to ensure Norway is aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal. Current policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient”, while its NDC target against fair share and net zero targets are rated as still “Insufficient. The exported emissions from Norwegian oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s overall “Almost sufficient” rating. Norway continues to support an expansion of oil and gas exploration in its already large fossil fuel sector. Norway’s exported fossil fuels are a large source of global emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account. The government is seeking to throw out a case currently before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that charges that approval of new permits to drill for oil and gas would constitute a breach of fundamental human rights. Norway leads the world on electric vehicle (EV) adoption thanks to a long track record of government support and regulation. It is on track to achieve its 2025 phase out of fossil fuel vehicle sales well ahead of schedule, with the market sales share of zero emission vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles combined reaching 86% in February 2022 , and on track to reach 100% by the end of 2022. Reducing Norwegian transport sector emissions is a top priority given the power sector is already mostly decarbonised. This also means the electrification of transport in Norway leads to a disproportionately large reduction in emissions relative to other countries that burn fossil fuel to generate electricity."
Norway,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Norway’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Almost sufficient” . The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that some elements of Norway’s efforts are world leading, like its updated 2030 emissions reduction target, but its climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Norway’s updated at least 55% NDC reduction target aligns with least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C. To achieve its updated NDC target, Norway will need to enhance its current policies which are currently “Almost sufficient” and in line with 2°C warming. We also rate Norway’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. Norway should provide additional, predictable, finance to developing countries to meet its fair share contribution. Norway’s rating does not consider exported emissions from its large oil and gas production sector."
Norway,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Norway’s policies and action as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Current policies are projected to lead to emission levels of 41MtCO 2 e by 2030, which is 21% below emissions in 1990. Norway will need to adopt further policies in order to meet its recently strengthened NDC target. Norway’s electricity generation is almost exclusively renewable: in 2020, 90% of electricity was generated by hydro power plants and 2.6% from wind farms. Less than 2% of generation was from thermal power plants, mostly in industrial heat processes. As a result of its prominent hydropower supply, Norway can play a key role in balancing the electricity grids of neighbouring countries, depending on the weather in a given year. Norway is home to the biggest hydrocarbon reserves in Europe, making it the world’s fifth largest exporter of crude oil, and its offshore drilling activities have been subject to a carbon tax since 1991. In 1999, the carbon tax was increased, and in 2005 Norway joined the EU ETS. By 2018, around 80% of greenhouse gas emissions were taxed, with the highest tax charged on domestic aviation and mineral oil. Through higher taxes, investments in carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been viable since 1996, after which nearly 1 MtCO 2 e a year has been captured from the Sleipner Vest oilfield. In January 2021, the Norwegian government announced plans to gradually raise its carbon tax until it reaches NOK 2,000 (USD 220) by 2030. Despite Norway successfully utilising this technology on a number of its oilfields, it remains prohibitively expensive and has rarely been deployed successfully elsewhere, with the future of this technology remaining uncertain. Despite Norway’s relatively high carbon tax, its oil and gas sector continues to be a large emissions source, making up over a quarter of total emissions in 2020. The vast majority of emissions resulting from this sector are from combustion abroad. While this enormous source of emissions is not counted under Norway’s emissions inventory, it far outweighs total domestic emissions and represents a blight on Norway’s climate record. The current government has refused to consider a phase-out of this sector, confirming its commitment to allowing an expansion of drilling and exploration in the Barents Sea, though this decision is currently being challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. While the decarbonisation of Norway’s transport system is one of the three main goals of its National Transport Plan 2022–2033, almost half of the NOK 1,200 billion (USD 132bn) allocated to measures covering the period of the plan still flowed into the construction and improvement of roads and highways. Relatively high road infrastructure investments like this are, to an extent, a byproduct of Norway’s low population density. However, there is a stated commitment to increase government spending on key public transport projects in the four largest urban areas and reduce ticket prices in the main cities. In 2021, battery electric vehicles (BEV) sales alone reached a 65% market share, equal to 110,000 vehicles. BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combined reached an 86% share of new sales, far ahead of any other country in the world, and on track to reach 100% by the end of 2022. The increasing share of electric cars in new sales has also had an impact on the overall share of zero emissions vehicles: by the end of 2020, 16% of Norway’s car fleet was fully battery electric, with a further 6% PHEVs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway amended its Petroleum Taxation Act to temporarily allow oil and gas companies to deduct investments from the tax base. Companies were also able claim the tax value of losses incurred in 2020 and 2021 from the state. The full policy and action analysis is available here ."
Norway,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,1.5°C global least cost,"In November 2022, Norway formally updated its NDC, committing to strengthening its 2030 NDC target to at least a 55% reduction below 1990 levels. We rate this strengthened target as compatible with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C on a globally cost-effective basis."
Nigeria,Overview,no rating,"Messages around climate change and the energy transition by Nigeria’s executive branch remain ambiguous with a strong focus on continuing oil and gas development after the election of President Bola Tinubu in February 2023. Similar to his predecessor, President Tinubu has given mixed messages on energy priorities. While he has acknowledged the need to reduce reliance on the oil and gas sector and develop solar power, he has also expressed support for increased oil and gas production for domestic consumption and export. Whilst Nigeria’s policies and targets represent a fair contribution to limiting global warming with its own resources, to actually reduce emissions to a level consistent with 1.5ºC it needs to decarbonise its economy and will require international support to do so. Overall, the CAT rates Nigeria’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to achieve net zero by 2060, considered in our planned policies scenario, requires significant international support. The government aimed to secure an initial USD 10 billion support package ahead of COP27 to kickstart implementation, but has not secured financing as of May 2023. Nigeria has adopted new measures and announced plans to reduce emissions: In January 2023, Nigeria adopted new Methane Guidelines that include mandatory measures for oil and gas companies, such as leak detection, to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Under the 2021 Climate Change Act, the government is required to develop a carbon tax and carbon trading. In February 2023, the Director General of the National Council on Climate Change announced plans to unveil a carbon tax policy. While these are positive developments, the government’s continued reliance on oil and gas risk locking Nigeria into emissions-intensive infrastructure. This will likely lead to the major stranding of assets and misallocation of investment resources and continue to drive up national emissions. To meet its net zero ambitions, Nigeria could: Pursue a more rapid uptake of renewable energy , rather than the delayed approach put forward in the Energy Transition Plan that relies on rapid expansion of gas in the near-term. Move ahead with implementing the Climate Change Act and clarify elements of the net zero target , such as emissions coverage and the role of carbon removals. Avoid locking in to high-emission fossil gas infrastructure projects , such as the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline and additional LNG export capacity. With uncertainty in long-term fossil gas demand, these investments are at risk of becoming stranded assets. According to the IEA, no new oil or gas field development is needed to reach net zero emissions (NZE) in 2050. The IEA’s 2022 update of its NZE scenario indicates that African oil and gas production needs to decline by 41% and 13% below 2021 levels by 2030 respectively, and 82% for oil and 78% for gas by 2050. In other words, expanding the availability of oil or gas in Nigeria or anywhere else in the world is inconsistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC and achieving net zero emissions by 2050."
Nigeria,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Nigeria’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Nigeria’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. Nigeria’s unconditional target meets its fair share contribution to limit warming to 1.5°C; however, its conditional target is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to the level of climate action needed within the country. While Nigeria’s policies and action are 1.5°C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution, they are not on track when compared to the level of climate action needed within the country to meet that warming limit. Nigeria needs additional support to implement additional policies and to strengthen and meet its conditional target. Our ratings are based on a historical emissions time series constructed using government data for consistency with government planning and dialogue, but it's important to note that government-reported emissions are significantly lower than international sources, largely due to the differences in estimates for energy sector emissions. Our ratings may change in the future if there is a significant revision to emissions data."
Nigeria,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"The CAT estimates that Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions would reach 34-43% above 2010 levels excluding LULUCF in 2030 under current policies and including the impact of COVID-19. In August 2022, Nigeria released its Energy Transition Plan (ETP), put forward as the key strategy to achieving its 2060 net zero target; however, the plan relies on significant action after 2030. Former President Buhari has declared the period to 2030 the “Decade of Gas”. As Nigeria is currently seeking international support to kick-start implementation of the ETP, we have included it in our planned policies scenario rather than in our current policies scenario. Nigeria’s current policies are rated 1.5˚C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution from its own resources. The “1.5˚C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. While Nigeria’s policies and action are consistent with a fair contribution to climate action, they do not put Nigeria on track to meet either of its targets. These policies are also inconsistent with the level of emissions cuts needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Implementation of the ETP, reflected in our planned policies scenario, would put Nigeria on track to meets its unconditional target, but not its conditional target. Nigeria will need to implement additional policies with its own resources to meet its unconditional target, but will also need international support to implement policies in line with full decarbonisation to meet and exceed its conditional target. Key steps to reducing the gap between current policies and Nigeria’s NDC targets include progressing towards and ramping up its renewable energy target and halting the expansion of natural gas."
Nigeria,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria committed to reducing emissions by 47% below BAU by 2030, conditional on international support. This is equivalent to an emissions level 1% above to 23% below 2010 levels by 2030 excluding LULUCF. While this is a strong conditional target, Nigeria will need to strengthen its policies to make sure it has the enabling conditions in place to meet the target, in addition to receiving international support. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 conditional target as “Almost sufficient,” a rating that indicates that Nigeria’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Nigeria’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Nigeria’s conditional target spans the CAT’s ""Almost sufficient"" and 1.5°C compatible ratings. The large target range is due to uncertainty around the extent to which Nigeria plans to rely on the land sector in meeting its target. Further clarity from Nigeria on this may result in a 1.5°C compatible target."
Nigeria,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria recommitted to unconditionally reducing emissions 20% below BAU by 2030. This is equivalent to an emissions level of 17-27% above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF) by 2030. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 unconditional target as 1.5°C compatible. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range. The fair share literature for Nigeria is sparse and some equity categories have few data points. As a result, the upper bound of Nigeria’s fair share range is dominated by a handful of studies. This high range is not reflective of the majority of the literature, which indicates more stringent emission reductions. Future equity studies may help to improve the fair share analysis for Nigeria."
Nigeria,Net zero target,Average,"In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act that seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions, green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a target to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070. At COP26, former President Buhari further committed to net zero emissions by 2060, which would be in line with the Climate Change Act. Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan, released August 2022, was developed to serve as the pathway towards achieving the 2060 net zero target. As the Act only sets the framework for adopting a net zero GHG target between 2050 and 2070, the final net zero target could improve on several elements. In particular, the target should clarify emissions coverage and the role of carbon removals in achieving the target. We evaluate the target design as “Average”. The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
New Zealand,Overview,no rating,"NOTE: No updates were made to the quantitative assessment from November 2022. In May 2022, New Zealand released its first emissions reduction plan, outlining a series of policies and incentives to decarbonise all sectors. Within it, New Zealand has published three multi-year emissions budgets which are marginally lower than the Climate Change Commission’s proposed budgets. However, it remains unclear how the Government will ensure the emissions trading scheme (NZ-ETS), a key tool for meeting its climate target, is fit to prioritise gross emissions (excluding LULUCF) reductions without significant policy enhancement. Agricultural methane emissions, representing over 40% of New Zealand’s total emissions, remain exempt from the NZ-ETS, and while a new proposal to reduce emissions from agriculture has now been tabled, it has yet to be adopted or fully endorsed, but even then it is unlikely to have a significant impact. New Zealand submitted an updated NDC in November 2021, increasing its emissions reduction target from 30% to 50% below gross 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. While the updated NDC target purportedly strengthens the 2030 target by 20 percentage points, it was based on two misleading accounting methods that more than halve its effective reduction in net emissions (including LULUCF emissions) to only 22% below 2005 levels by 2030. To remain 1.5˚C compatible, New Zealand needs to set a 2030 target of a reduction in gross emissions of at least 44%. While the strengthened target shifts the rating of the target against modelled pathways and fair share, it does not change the overall CAT rating of “Highly Insufficient”. To its credit New Zealand has a target of net zero emissions by 2050 enshrined in law, under the Zero Carbon Act, but its short-term policies cannot yet keep up with this ambition. It is relying on the mitigation potential of offsets in the land use and forestry sector both within and outside its borders to meet its 2030 target, rather than focusing efforts on reducing emissions from high emitting sectors. However, a recent court verdict has freed the government from its legal obligation of keeping its emissions budget (which is part of the Zero Carbon Act) compatible with the 1.5˚C temperature limit, stating the 1.5˚C limit is only “aspirational”, highlighting the inadequacy of the climate law. The New Zealand government plans to purchase emissions credits to achieve its 2030 NDC target using international offsets, in anticipation of an emissions overshoot. This would amount to New Zealand having to purchase international offsets amounting to around 75–102 MtCO 2 e over time given the NDC’s emissions budget is 571 MtCO 2 e, which would set an alarming precedent for significant offset purchasing to meet an NDC. New Zealand is set to meet by far the highest proportion of its target (two thirds of the action required) through buying international offsets compared with any other OECD country. These purchases would be linked to the NZ-ETS, to ensure that credits auctioned by Government are backed by reductions in emissions overseas. However this exposes New Zealand to highly volatile prices in EU-ETS markets as well as increasing concerns about the quality of international offsets, given the high uncertainties around the verification, permanence and principles of additionality. Methane from agriculture and waste has a separate target (a reduction of 10% by 2030 and 24-47% by 2050 below 2017 levels are required), that is not yet covered by significant policies. Overall, the CAT rates New Zealand’s current climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The government also needs to revisit its target architecture and drop the much discredited “gross-net” approach to target setting. New Zealand is one of only a few countries in the world using this “gross net” accounting system to calculate its 2030 target."
New Zealand,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates New Zealand’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s climate policies and commitments are not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and need substantial improvements. New Zealand’s NDC target is rated “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action and “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Its policies and action do not put in on track to meet this target and its climate finance is inadequate. New Zealand should increase both its emissions reduction target and climate policies, and provide additional, predictable, finance to others to meet its fair share contribution."
New Zealand,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"Zealand’s current policies are “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s policies and action in 2030 are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow New Zealand’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. In May 2022, the Government published the first of three staggered, multi-year emissions reduction budgets to curb its carbon dioxide emissions by around 35% by 2035, thus adopting its first emissions reduction plan (ERP) to 2050. The new multi-budget approach sets out the total emissions New Zealand must cut over the next 14 years, through domestic activities, capping the amount of CO 2 gases to 290 MtCO 2 e over three years. The scheme provides $2.9 billion of first year funding to the Climate Emergency Fund, as announced in the Budget 2022. The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen. Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024. The Government has an electric vehicle target for government fleet vehicles to be carbon neutral by 2025/26 and has introduced the country’s first-ever CO 2 emissions standard for imported cars in 2021. The government is developing a hydrogen roadmap, based on a vision paper that is in support of opportunities for domestic use and the export of green hydrogen. For more detail, see the policies and action section here ."
New Zealand,NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF). The new target equates to around 51 MtCO 2 e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO 2 e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”. This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C."
Nepal,Overview,no rating,"Since our last update in 2021, Nepal has released its Long-Term Strategy, an important step in enhancing its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality, after releasing its second NDC in 2020. Under a scenario in its LTS, if borne out, Nepal intends to reach carbon neutrality by as soon as 2045, if its carbon sink is included. The CAT’s rating of Nepal’s climate targets and action remains “Almost sufficient”. In its latest NDC, Nepal has set an activity-based target for both its unconditional and conditional targets. However, given it has no absolute emissions reduction in the unconditional target, the CAT instead uses Nepal’s current policy projections as its unconditional target and rates this as “1.5°C compatible” compared to Nepal’s fair share. The CAT estimates Nepal’s conditional target as 59–64 MtCO 2 e in 2030, which Nepal will achieve easily with current policies. We rate this as “Critically Insufficient” compared to its modelled domestic pathway. As a least developed country, Nepal would need significant international support to increase its climate ambition and implement more stringent policies to enable deep decarbonisation aligned with a global least cost 1.5°C compatible domestic emissions pathway. Nepal needs to enhance the ambition of its NDC targets beyond the level of current policies to drive real world emission reductions and expand its LTS beyond CO 2 emissions, since around 54% of national emissions are from methane, mostly from the agriculture sector. Nepal’s electricity generation comes from 100% renewable energy sources since 2015. The government plans to expand more of hydroelectricity and all types of renewable energy. For instance, in 2023, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 1.5 GW of run-of-the-river hydropower projects, and these are expected to continue until they reach a cumulative 6.75 GW by 2028. Nepal additionally supplies its neighboring countries with renewable energy, reducing their carbon intensity. Nepal has pushed forward with rolling out electric vehicle (EV) policies in 2022. There are several fiscal incentives i.e. for EV purchase and road tax exemption. EV imports have greatly increased and a considerable number of charging stations have been installed. Through its NDC, the government of Nepal aims to phase out petrol-diesel vehicles with EVs by 2031. In its new budget (FY 2022-2023), the government plans to install 500 charging stations throughout the country, although currently only around 50 are operational. Nepal government also announced a renewal and tax waiver for EVs for the next five years."
Nepal,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Nepal’s climate targets and action as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Nepal’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. While Nepal’s updated NDC is a step in the right direction, Nepal needs to strengthen its conditional target further, with international support."
Nepal,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"Nepal’s current policies and action are 1.5°C compatible when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nepal’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nepal’s climate policies and action. Emissions have continued to grow in Nepal, going from about 35-49 MtCO 2 e between 2010 and 2020, based on CAT calculation from historical emissions data. While the government is showing some progress in the implementation of its mitigation policies, under current policies, emissions are expected to increase by about 10% above current levels by 2030. Current policies and actions are not sufficient to meet the lower end of Nepal’s updated conditional target, nor are they where Nepal needs to be when compared with modelled domestic pathways. Nepal needs to implement more stringent policies, for which it will need international support. The full policies and action analysis can be found here"
Nepal,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"Nepal's current ""Critically insufficient"" rating indicates that its conditional 2030 target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Nepal’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. We haven't included all sectoral measures in our assessment of Nepal’s conditional target because the NDC provided limited details on some of the sectoral target, so it was not possible to estimate the impact of all of them. Nepal is encouraged to provide further information on the quantification of its NDC and to improve this target with international support."
Nepal,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"Nepal’s unconditional target is “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nepal’s fair share target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nepal’s latest NDC doesn’t provide clear quantification of the unconditional target, hence the CAT has rated it against emissions under current policies and action."
Nepal,Land use & forestry,Source & Sink,"In Nepal, land use and forests served as carbon sink from 1997–2015 and was a carbon source from 2016–2021. The CAT estimated that LULUCF emissions were about 14 MtCO 2 e/yr in 2021. Nepal would need significant international support to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, as Nepal relies highly on a LULUCF carbon sink in their carbon neutrality scenario. In addition, Nepal aims to maintain 45% forest cover (including other wooded land limited to less than 4%) by 2030. As of its enhanced NDC 2020, the forest coverage percentage in 2020 has reached approximately 44.7%."
Nepal,Net zero target,Average,"Nepal announced a 2045 net zero carbon emissions target at COP26. In 2021, Nepal released its Long-term Strategy, aimed at reaching carbon neutrality by 2045 or sooner and negative carbon emissions by 2050. We evaluate the target as ""Average""."
Morocco,Overview,no rating,"Morocco has taken several positive steps on climate action, including a substantially enhanced NDC in 2021. However, it remains heavily dependent on coal, and the government has announced plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. It needs to commit to a coal phase out if it hopes to achieve the conditional NDC target but would need international support to do so. Considering the climate policies put in place by the government, we estimate Morocco’s emissions will flatten until 2030, which would enable the country to meet its unconditional NDC target. With this update, the CAT continues to rate Morocco’s climate targets and actions as “Almost sufficient”. Morocco has not yet submitted a new NDC despite all countries having been invited to do so before COP27. However, its latest, 2021 NDC update significantly strengthened both its conditional and unconditional emissions reduction targets. The CAT estimates that Morocco’s updated NDC would lead to 84 and 118 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 under its conditional and unconditional targets respectively, down from 107 and 145 MtCO2e under its original NDC. Morocco is on track to meeting its unconditional NDC target, but it needs additional support and measures to meet its conditional NDC. Positive recent climate developments in Morocco include: A commitment to halt the development of new coal-fired power plants at COP26 The ramping up of decarbonisation efforts in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, with new policies planned for the phosphate industry and the agricultural sector The release of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy , which seeks to reduce energy consumption in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, including a 24% energy consumption reduction in the transport sector To continue improving its climate action, Morocco could: Commit to a rapid coal phase-out from the power mix, with support from the international community Strengthen its renewable energy targets to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement Stop investing in coal and fossil gas The government’s renewable energy targets remain the core of the country’s decarbonisation efforts. Morocco currently aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 52% of its electricity mix by 2030. The country pioneered renewable energy developments in the 2010’s, but the pace has recently slowed down, with solar capacity additions stalling in 2019 and 2020. Considering that renewable energy amounted to 30% of electricity capacity in 2020, Morocco will need to considerably increase the roll out of renewable projects to meet its 2030 target. Morocco’s electricity mix remains heavily dominated by coal, with lifetime extensions recently planned for key coal-fired plants. At COP26, Morocco agreed to cease permit issuance and construction of new plants but has not committed to a coal phase-out. On top of that, the government has recently unveiled plans to expand fossil gas infrastructure. In 2022, Algeria recently halted gas supply via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which previously accounted for all of Morocco’s gas imports. As a result, Morocco is now building LNG terminals to accommodate imports via Spain. Morocco has also opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. These developments pose a significant threat to Morocco’s decarbonisation plans and risk locking the country into a high-emissions pathway. International support will therefore be key to help Morocco make the best of its vast renewable energy potential and ditch fossil gas and coal once and for all."
Morocco,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Morocco’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. Morocco’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s conditional target, to be achieved with international support, is almost, but not yet compatible with 1.5°C of warming and needs to be strengthened. Morocco would need international support to implement additional policies and go slightly beyond its current conditional target."
Morocco,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"We rate Morocco’s policies and actions as “1.5°C compatible” compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Morocco’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Morocco’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. When compared to modelled domestic pathways, the policies and action are not yet sufficient for getting on a decarbonisation pathway. Morocco should embark on such a pathway—with international support. Morocco has put forward a detailed list of measures it will deploy to reach its updated NDC target issued in June 2021, separated into conditional and unconditional measures, with many of them already under implementation. While there is some evidence of implementation underway, particularly for renewable energy projects, there is overall limited information available to assess progress. However, recent developments could jeopardise long-term decarbonisation and lead to either a lock-in of emissions or stranded assets. The Moroccan government recently unveiled plans to expand gas infrastructure and has opened its doors to offshore gas exploration. On top of that, Morocco still relies heavily on coal. In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a). Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Morocco,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate Morocco’s conditional NDC target as “Almost Sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C."
Morocco,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Almost Sufficient,"We rate the unconditional NDC reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Morocco’s unconditional target against fair share in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector. This resulted in a change in the rating of the unconditional target against fair share (from “1.5°C compatible” to “Almost sufficient”) but did not have an impact on the overall rating of Morocco."
Morocco,Net zero target,Information incomplete,The CAT does not yet evaluate Morocco’s net zero target given its preliminary nature and lack of more detailed information. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.
Mexico,Overview,no rating,"Mexico’s climate policies continue to go backwards, as fossil fuel use is prioritised and climate-related policies and institutions dismantled. Mexico’s updated 2030 target (NDC), submitted in November 2022 results in higher emission levels than the targets from 2016, breaching both agreements under the Paris Agreement and Mexican Law – where governments committed to improve their targets over time. The updated NDC lacks transparency and disguises its lack of ambition by counting forests differently in the base and in the target year. Mexico will meet the unambitious target with already implemented policies as emissions continue to rise through 2030. With this update, the CAT’s rating of Mexico’s climate targets and action worsens from “Highly insufficient” to “Critically insufficient”. While the new target includes a larger percentage reduction it still leads to higher emissions. The NDC update increases the percentage reduction of the unconditional target from 22% to 35% (30% with own resources and an additional 5% from agreed international support) by 2030 and from 36% to 40% conditional on additional international support. But the business-as-usual (BAU) baseline, against which the targets are defined, has been revised upwards. In addition Mexico expects a higher contribution of emissions sinks in forests to achieving the target. Together this means that the new target can be met even if emissions excluding those of forestry are higher than what they could have been under the old target. The 2022 NDC update replaces the 2020 update, which became invalid after a Mexican court found that it is less ambitious than the very first NDC of 2016 and therefore a violation of continuous progression of ambition. The 2022 update is less specific on the contribution of forestry to the target, which may make it more difficult to argue its ambition. Mexico pursues a “gross-net” approach, meaning it counts only emissions sources in its BAU, ignoring sinks from land use and forestry. However, the NDC does intend to use these sinks to achieve the target, highlighting that nature-based solutions are ‘central’ to achieving the targets. In 2019, reported sinks were almost 200 MtCO 2 e, or about a quarter of Mexico’s emissions excl. land use, land use change and forestry. While technically allowed, this accounting approach has been criticised as in-transparent for over 20 years. Mexico’s 2022 NDC update removes the target to peak emissions in 2026 and does not mention any net zero nor other long-term targets. Mexico’s climate policies under President Lopez Obrador continue to go backwards, as fossil fuel use is prioritised and climate-related policies and institutions dismantled. This puts the country’s emissions pathway even further from the Paris Agreement 1.5°C goal. Mexico’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise – despite the brief dip caused by the COVID-19 pandemic – and are projected to continue increasing through 2030. Mexico is on track to achieve its old and new unambitious climate targets in 2030. For Mexico to reverse trends and transition towards a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, it needs to reverse its policies, move away from fossil fuels, foster renewable energy, and tackle the transport sector. Instead of investing in renewable energy, Mexico has acquired an oil refinery in the US and is fast-tracking the construction of another in Dos Bocas , Tabasco. These actions were included in the ten ‘climate’ actions Mexico is committed to pursuing in the coming years, presented by President Lopez Obrador at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate held by President Biden in June 2022. Lopez Obrador’s government also continues to subsidise the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector as a response to the global energy crisis and inflation rates that have stemmed from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. As part of the Federal Budget for 2021 and again in 2022 , over 70% of the budget under ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation effects’ has been allocated to the transport infrastructure of fossil gas. Reforms to the General Climate Change Law in 2020 eliminated the Climate Change Fund and in 2021, the government announced the dissolution of the National Institute for Climate Change. The dismantling of climate change governance sends a clear message to Mexicans and the international community that climate change and the environment are simply not a priority in Mexico. However, Lopez Obrador’s party lost its qualified majority in congress in the 2021 elections, enabling its political opposition to stop the executive’s proposal to reform Mexico’s energy system in April 2022. With this proposed reform , the government intended to limit the participation of private electricity producers and disestablish the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) and the Clean Energy Certificates. Prior to the vote against the energy reform, a massive civil society protest movement created a public debate on the implications of the proposal—sending a clear message to the government that Mexicans are concerned about climate change and their future."
Mexico,Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Mexico’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with any interpretation of a fair-share contribution and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Mexico’s overall rating has worsened since the last update as our estimations of the updated climate commitments show significantly higher emission limits in 2030 that are not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. The 2022 NDC update provides an updated, increased BAU baseline, and provides lack of transparency regarding the sectoral contributions towards achieving the targets – particularly that of the forestry sector."
Mexico,Policies and action against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"We rate Mexico’s policies and actions as “Highly insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling emissions and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Under the government of President Lopez Obrador Mexico’s climate policies have gone backwards—largely because it continues to choose policies that prioritise the use of fossil fuels under the discourse of energy sovereignty and republican austerity. Since Lopez Obrador’s election in 2018, several policies supporting renewable energy and climate change in general have been rolled backed or reformed. In January 2019, the Mexican government cancelled long term electricity auctions – instruments that had incentivised an increase in renewable energy for electricity production in Mexico over three years – and reverted a former government decision to retire the oldest and dirtiest electricity fossil-fuel power plants. In 2020, the Mexican Ministry of Energy published a bill that would effectively halt private renewable energy investment in the country, prioritising the government's own ageing, fossil fuel-fired power plants. More recently, the government allocated most of the ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation’ budget in 2021 and 2022 to fossil gas transport infrastructure. It is building an oil refinery in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, has acquired one in Texas, US, and continues to subsidise the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector. Since 2013, Mexico has continued to report its historical emissions at much higher levels than the already high emissions projections under the NDC baseline submitted in 2016. Emissions from the energy sector increased by 34% between 1990 and 2019. This sector alone was responsible for nearly two thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions in Mexico in 2019 (aside from the forestry sector). Nearly a third of projected emissions are expected from the transport sector in 2030. In December 2021, a new version of the Special Climate Change Program (PECC, in Spanish) was published , outlining objectives, strategies, actions and goals related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Its Objective 2: “reduce greenhouse gas emissions” lists a number of actions regarding renewable energy, which seem to contradict the rollback of energy policies in recent years. Other actions are focused on increasing efficiency in fossil fuel generation plants or mitigation in oil & gas extraction – contradicting the transformative decarbonisation measures needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal. During his speech at President Biden’s Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in June 2022, President Lopez Obrador presented ten ‘climate’ actions his government is prioritising in the next years. Two of these actions include ramping up fossil fuel production to achieve energy sovereignty by modernising six oil refineries, acquiring one in the US and building a new one in Dos Bocas, and building two new coke plants to be able to domestically transform fuel oil into gasoline."
Mexico,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"We rate the conditional NDC target of an up to 40% greenhouse gas reduction from a BAU baseline scenario in 2030 as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. We have also estimated a range for the contribution of the forestry and land use sector, given the lack of details in the NDC update. See the Assumptions section for more details."
Mexico,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,Critically insufficient,"We rate Mexico’s 2030 updated NDC target of reducing all greenhouse gas emissions by 30% under a business-as-usual (BAU) baseline scenario in 2030 with own resources as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Mexico’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit when compared to its fair share. Mexico’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Mexico’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. The CAT rates what a country intends to do with its own resources against its fair share. As the updated Mexican NDC specifies within its unconditional target that 5% of the 35% reduction will be achieved through “agreed international support for ‘clean energies 1 ’”, we have considered only 30% reduction from BAU in 2030 as Mexico’s target to be achieved with domestic means. The NDC update includes a BAU baseline that has been revised upwards from the 2016 NDC and is very similar to the (no longer valid) 2020 NDC update. The updated baseline specifies a sectoral breakdown that includes emissions from forestry but excludes forestry removals. In contrast to the 2016 NDC, the 2022 update does not include the expected sectoral contributions to achieve the target. Notably, the gross-net approach for accounting for the contribution of the forestry sector significantly reduces the need for action to achieve the “Critically Insufficient” target: while removals are not included in the baseline, they are mentioned within the text to be ‘central’ to achieving the target. In 2021, after civil society won an ‘amparo’ lawsuit (under the constitution) against the lack of ambition of Mexico’s December 2020 updated NDC , a judge reinstated Mexico’s original 2016 climate targets. The reason for this decision was that Mexico’s updated climate commitments, albeit unchanged in terms of reduction percentages, resulted in a higher emissions level due to an upward revision of the baseline. It also was less transparent than the original and excluded the target of peak emissions in 2026. The court also reinstated the 2050 goal from Mexico’s Mid-Century Strategy. Due to the lack of details on the contribution of the forestry and land use sector in the updated climate targets, we consider a range between assumptions. See the Assumptions section for more details. 1 Mexico includes electricity generation through fossil gas efficient cogeneration of as part of its definition of ‘clean energies’."
Mexico,Land use & forestry,Sink,"The land use, land-use change and forestry has been a stable sink in Mexico over the last 20 years. Notably, the 2022 NDC update considers this sector to be ‘central’ to achieving the updated 2030 climate targets. While emissions from forestry are considered in the BAU baseline and sinks are not, the NDC text mentions sinks from land use and forestry are expected to achieve the target – without specifics on the expected contribution of the sector."
Kenya,Overview,no rating,"Kenya’s domestic efforts to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement are in line with its fair share due to its limited responsibility and capability, but could still be significantly improved: the unconditional emissions reduction target is well overachieved by the policies that are already implemented. Kenya would also have to propose a more ambitious conditional target that it would be ready to achieve provided significant international support. We rate Kenya’s current conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Kenya submitted its updated NDC with a slightly stronger target in December 2020, committing to reducing emissions by 32% below BAU by 2030 (including LULUCF), with 21% of the mitigation cost not conditional on international financial support. While Kenya’s policies and unconditional target are rated 1.5°C compatible, there is still significant potential for Kenya to strive for further emissions reductions in all sectors. Kenya has significant renewable energy capacity. In 2021, more than 90% of generated electricity came from renewable sources. However, the country’s long-term energy planning still accounts for coal making up 12% of the energy mix by 2040. While efforts to halt the development of the Lamu coal-fired power plant have been successful, the future of the Kitui coal-fired power plant is still unclear. If successful, this will be Kenya’s first coal-fired power plant. Although COVID-19 recovery efforts were mainly focused on socio-economic factors, some steps have been taken towards climate action over the past two years. In 2020, the Ministry of Energy released the Kenya National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, establishing energy efficiency targets in the buildings, industry, agriculture, transport, and power sectors to meet the goal of reducing the national energy intensity by 2.8% a year. In 2021, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry introduced the Sustainable Waste Management Act to progress the solid waste NAMA. In 2021, the Kenyan parliament proposed an amendment to the Forest Conservation and Management Bill that would open the door for further deforestation. Since the LULUCF sector will account for around half of Kenya’s emissions reductions, the new amendment could put Kenya’s climate targets at considerable risk."
Kenya,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"The CAT rates Kenya’s climate targets and policies as overall “Almost sufficient”. Kenya’s policies and unconditional target meet its fair-share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Kenya’s target with international support is currently only compatible with 4°C of warming or higher, and should be strengthened. The strong difference in the two ratings reflects Kenya’s situation as a country with strong development needs and a small historical responsibility, but with relevant mitigation potential in its own territory, which could be exploited to a large extent with international support."
Kenya,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"There is significant scope for the government to increase its climate ambition as sectors are likely to exceed their current climate targets based on the emissions reduction potential of prioritised mitigation actions. CAT rates Kenya’s policies and action as 1.5°C compatible when compared to its fair contribution. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond Kenya’s fair share with the help of international support. Kenya’s energy future is at a crossroads: while renewable energy accounts for 85% of installed capacity, just short of the government’s target of being powered entirely by green energy by 2020, there are still plans to incorporate coal and natural gas into the energy mix in the long term. While plans to revive the development of the Lamu power plant have been cancelled, the future of the Kitui coal plant is still unclear. While measures to meet emission reduction targets for the electricity supply, transport, and agriculture sectors are underway, it is unclear to what extent other mitigation actions outlined in the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) are being implemented. The recent National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy and Sustainable Waste Management Act still await corresponding implementation plans, but would result in emissions reductions in the energy demand and waste sectors, respectively."
Kenya,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"We rate Kenya’s conditional NDC as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Kenya’s conditional target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Kenya’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Kenya should improve its conditional target and specify support needs to achieve it. Already a small improvement in the target would change the rating to “Highly Insufficient”."
Kenya,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,We rate Kenya’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to their fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Kenya’s target that it wants to achieve through its own efforts is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.
Kenya,Land use & forestry,Source,"Kenya’s emissions from Land-use, land-use change and forestry have contributed to almost one third of the country’s total emissions over the last 20 years on average. The major reasons for deforestation are the conversion of forest land to agriculture, unsustainable utilisation of forest products (including charcoal), forest fires and shifting cultivation."
Kazakhstan,Overview,no rating,"Kazakhstan enhanced its long-term climate ambition by enshrining its net zero by 2060 target into law in February 2023, but then failed to increase short-term ambition in its updated NDC submission to the UNFCCC in June 2023, leaving its previously modest emission reduction targets for 2030 unchanged. Recent policy developments pull in opposite directions and continue to support fossil fuels more, driving emissions up. CAT projections show that Kazakhstan will not meet its climate targets, as emissions will grow until 2035 (at least) under current policies. As a result, the CAT rates Kazakhstan’s overall climate action as “Insufficient”. Kazakhstan’s economy and government rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy, industry, exports, and revenue. As a result, Kazakhstan has the world's 16th highest per capita and fourth highest per GDP emissions. However, aging and poorly regulated fossil fuel infrastructure and industries are failing to meet the needs of citizens who have contended with energy shortages more regularly in recent years. Renewable energy and more efficient technologies are helping to mitigate energy supply shortages and emissions, though Kazakhstan’s vast renewable resources largely remain untapped. To limit global warming to 1.5ºC, the government need to build on its success with scaling up renewables in recent years. Though starting from a low base, renewable energy generation has trebled since 2019 and increased 20-fold since 2011. Policies such as the emissions trading system (ETS) and renewable energy auctions have contributed to this shift. The government raised the 2030 renewable energy target from 10 to 15% in 2021. In addition to policies supporting renewable energy, the government will need to roll back those that support fossil fuels to avoid carbon lock-in and reduce transition risks. For example, the government would need to revisit plans for new coal power generation (announced at the end of 2022), the introduction of new fiscal incentives for fossil fuel exploration and production (most recent additions in 2023), and depending on fossil gas to meet its energy needs (Republic of Kazakhstan, 2023a). To improve the credibility and implementation of Kazakhstan’s long-term climate ambitions, the government could prioritise the following actions: Develop a clear and enforceable net zero policy implementation plan: the government needs to translate its net zero by 2060 strategy into an implementable and enforceable plan to achieve its goals. Legally binding sectoral targets, well timed and coordinated policy packages, and clear accountability and robust review processes are features that could help. Increase ambition of short-term targets in the NDC and other policies. Short-term emissions reduction and related targets have not increased - or increased only marginally - in the last decade and can no longer be considered ambitious. Kazakhstan would need update such targets as soon as possible. Boost renewable energy roll-out. Recent high-pace growth in renewable energy suggests there is significant potential to scale up. Further Increasing renewable energy targets is a clear first step, which would allow for more auctions. Additional efforts should focus on ensuring grid capacity keeps up with renewable energy growth, including extending the network in poorly connected northern regions. Develop a transparent 1.5ºC compatible coal phase-out plan for a just transition. Coal accounts for 55% of emissions, 70% of power generation, is the predominant source of heating in homes, and a major employer. A coal phase-out plan will be critical to guiding such a transition and ensuring it is just."
Kazakhstan,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Kazakhstan’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Kazakhstan’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Kazakhstan’s NDC is composed of a conditional and unconditional targets. Its conditional NDC target is rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways, and its unconditional NDC target is rated as “Insufficient” against its fair share contribution to climate action. To achieve its targets, Kazakhstan would need to significantly cut its emissions through more ambitious policies and action."
Kazakhstan,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"We rate Kazakhstan’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Kazakhstan’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Kazakhstan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Kazakhstan needs to implement more stringent policies, for which it will need additional support. Kazakhstan’s emissions under current policy projections continue to increase, in contradiction to the government’s NDC and its net zero targets. Plans for further development of and investment in fossil fuels, including the construction of new coal power plants and ramping up fossil gas and oil production, are particularly concerning. These plans fail to acknowledge the short-term steps necessary to keep the window open for a 1.5°C-consistent GHG emissions pathway, could deepen carbon lock-in, and increases transition risks. A recent uptick in renewable energy generation capacity, enabled by supportive government policies, offers some hope. However, renewable energy penetration is still low at only 2% of total primary energy and around 11% of power generation, of which more than half comes from existing hydropower. Still, at around 2.5 GW, solar and wind power capacity have almost trebled since 2019 and government targets for 2030 were increased from 10 to 15% in 2021. Kazakhstan is on track to meet these targets."
Kazakhstan,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Almost Sufficient,"We rate the conditional NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways.

If all countries were to follow Kazakhstan’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Kazakhstan did not increase the ambition of its conditional emissions reduction target in its NDC update, submitted to the UNFCCC on 27 June 2023 (Republic of Kazakhstan, 2023c). Government retained an economy-wide emission reduction target for 2030 of 25% relative to the 1990 base year."

Japan,Overview,no rating,"While its greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to their lowest since 2013, Japan is still set to miss its 2030 target if it does not implement more ambitious policies. The government’s climate agenda continues to place more emphasis on economic growth and energy security, rather than ambitious decarbonisation efforts. Japan’s latest Green Transformation strategy, the GX Basic Policy, does not provide concrete emissions reduction targets; instead, it promotes the development of so-called “clean coal” technologies in the power sector, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C. The government plans to update both its NDC and Basic Energy Plan. The new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, should seize this opportunity to prioritise the scale-up of renewable energy and move rapidly away from coal once and for all. The CAT continues to rate Japan’s overall climate targets and action as “Insufficient”. Japan’s 2030 emission reduction target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement and remains “Insufficient”. Japan aims to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030 below 2013 levels (and 50% below as an aspirational target), a target that still falls short of the more than 60% reduction below 2013 levels that a CAT analysis estimates as 1.5°C-compatible. The GX Basic Policy suggests the government is still reluctant to take the measures necessary to decarbonise its economy and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, as would be implied by its current net zero target. The new strategy provides no details on the expected emission reductions for 2030 and 2050. There are also concerns that the carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes envisioned by the government will not be effective in reducing Japan’s emissions. It remains unclear whether the emissions trading scheme planned for 2026 will still be based on voluntary participation, and the carbon levy, which will only be implemented in 2028, is expected to be set a low level. In a significant policy shift, Japan has unveiled plans to build new generation nuclear reactors, as part of the GX Basic Policy. Despite this reversal, many regulatory and economic hurdles to new nuclear reactors remain, making it unlikely that they will be operational before 2035-2040. Renewable energy deployment continues to take a back seat, as the government prioritises nuclear energy expansion and the development of so called “clean coal” technologies. The GX Basic Policy also puts a strong emphasis on the need to develop Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, and ammonia and hydrogen co-firing in the power sector, in Japan and overseas. However, these technologies would not be needed to decarbonise Japan’s energy sector if Japan fully harnessed the potential of its renewable energy sources, which are much cheaper in comparison and have a much lower environmental footprint. In April 2024, G7 countries agreed to phase out unabated coal power generation by 2035, an unambitious timeline for developed countries which should aim for a 2030 phase-out at the latest. The pledge gives leeway to Japan to keep relying on coal power plants with ammonia co-firing power and “high efficiency” coal power, which cannot be considered ""abated"" coal. The Japanese government is pushing for continued investment in upstream fossil gas and LNG, claiming it can be a transitional fossil fuel. Japan is also advocating for further development of LNG infrastructure in other countries, to sustain its large flow of imports. However, such investment further contributes to locking in carbon-intensive developments: Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C, and such investments are in stark contrast to what is needed to meet Paris Agreement goals. In policy documents, the Japanese government consistently uses terms such as “clean coal”, “green transformation”, “electrified vehicles” and “clean hydrogen”. However, these terms are undefined, often misleading and strengthen a harmful narrative, serving as a smokescreen to hide the government’s intention to keep relying on fossil fuels. Japan’s GHG emissions fell to a record low in 2022, mainly due to reduced energy consumption in the industry and commercial sectors. Without additional measures, Japan’s current policies and actions will lead to emission levels of 31% to 37% below 2013 levels in 2030, excluding LULUCF. This falls short of Japan’s NDC target, let alone the 60% below 2013 levels in 2030 needed to be in line with keeping warming below 1.5°C. The government is currently in the process of drafting its 2035 NDC and its Basic Energy Plan, which is the overarching document governing Japan’s energy policy. To improve its climate targets and action rating, Japan could: Commit to a full coal phase-out in a timeline consistent with pathways required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C Set new electricity mix targets for 2035 in the new Basic Energy Plan in line with the upcoming NDC target year Prioritise the scale-up of renewable energy capacity and strengthen related targets Strengthen its EV target to phase out all fossil-fuel passenger (ICE) cars from new sales by 2035. Stop public financing of fossil fuel projects overseas and stop the international promotion of “clean coal” technologies. Strengthen its 2030 target ambition level in line with the Paris Agreement Despite Japan’s overall lack of ambition, there have been a few positive developments worth highlighting, including some sub-national actions: The adoption of the “Renewable Energy Installation Standards”, a regulation requiring construction companies to install rooftop solar panels on new buildings in Tokyo, from 2025. The amendment of the Act on Sea Area Utilisation for Renewable energy to accelerate the development of offshore wind power, particularly floating wind turbines."
Japan,Description of CAT ratings,no rating,"The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation. Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions."
Japan,Overall rating,Insufficient,"The CAT rates Japan’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Japan’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Japan would need to improve its rating by increasing the ambition of its domestic emissions target, as well as providing and mobilising increased levels of financial support for further emissions reductions in other countries. We rate Japan’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share and its climate finance contribution as “Highly Insufficient”. While considering modelled domestic pathways, Japan’s domestic NDC target and its policies and action are rated as “Insufficient”.

Iran (Islamic Republic of),Overview,no rating,"Iran has gone through a decade of economic woes marked by international sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and high inflation. Despite a slight recovery in 2021, the economy is fragile and remains the government’s top priority. Developments in climate policy, including renewable energy, have been limited. Notably, Iran remains one of the few countries that has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. The Climate Action Tracker continues to rate Iran’s provisional climate pledge and climate policy as “Critically insufficient”. In its 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) , Iran committed to reducing emissions by 4% (unconditional reduction) or 12% (conditional reduction) below business as usual (BAU) by 2030. Iran is expected to significantly overachieve both targets, with currently implemented policies. The main reason for this is the highly inflated BAU scenario it used as a basis for the target. Iran’s economic turmoil has hindered its capacity to address climate change. Investments in mitigation measures – renewable energy deployment in particular– have significantly slowed in recent years, as the government has been prioritising Iran’s economic recovery. This is best exemplified by the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (2023-2027), a strategic document which serves as a guiding framework for annual budgets and policy developments. Unlike the previous edition, the new plan is exclusively focused on addressing Iran’s pressing economic challenges and is completely devoid of mitigation policies or renewable energy targets. The impact of the economic sanctions on Iran’s emissions has been mixed. While oil production and exports have both decreased, some production has been diverted to domestic consumption. In 2021, emissions increased by around 7% from the previous year due to the country’s gradual economic recovery. Iran is not immune from climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which are driving internal migration. An important first step would be for Iran to ratify the Paris Agreement, and revise its climate pledge, which we interpret as leading to more than doubling emissions from 2010 to 2030, well above what we expect emissions in 2030 to be with current policies. Iran, in its INDC, states that mitigation targets will not be implemented if international sanctions are in place."
Iran (Islamic Republic of),Overall rating,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Iran’s climate targets and policies as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating indicates that Iran’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Under Iran’s current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. To get a better rating, Iran needs to ratify the Paris Agreement, set a more ambitious target for emissions reductions, and establish and implement ambitious policies."

The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C."
Iran (Islamic Republic of),Fair share target,Critically insufficient,"The CAT rates Iran’s unconditional target as “Critically Insufficient” against its fair share range . Iran’s unconditional target pledges an emissions reduction of 4% below business as usual in 2030. The CAT estimates this would lead to emissions increasing by around 145% compared to 2010 levels. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Iran’s unconditional target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C."

Ethiopia,Overview,no rating,"Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances. In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC, but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated. The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Ethiopia,Overall rating,Almost Sufficient,"Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements. Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target."
Ethiopia,Policies and action  against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition."
Ethiopia,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Critically insufficient,"In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target. Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target. Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update."
Ethiopia,Unconditional NDC target against fair share,1.5°C compatible,"The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range."
Ethiopia,Land use & forestry,Source,Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.
Ethiopia,Net zero target,Information incomplete,"Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete” The full net zero target analysis can be found here ."
Egypt,Overview,no rating,"Egypt's second climate plan (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2023, is almost identical to its predecessor, except for a slightly revised emissions reduction target in the power sector. As Africa's second largest fossil gas producer, Egypt's focus on expanding fossil gas production and exports has largely overshadowed recent investments in renewable energy. The current 2030 target would still see emissions continuing to rise, surpassing even the levels expected with the current policies in place. The CAT continues to rate Egypt’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient”. The updated NDC still lacks transparency, making any quantitative assessment difficult. Egypt could easily overachieve its NDC target with the policies it already has in place. Egypt’s target is conditional on international support, but it doesn't specify an unconditional component. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the government needs to submit a further strengthened and transparent target, spelling out its unconditional component. In 2022, a number of governments, development banks and private financiers committed to deliver USD 10 bn in finance through the Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) Program, a platform created to support the Egypt’s climate actions. This initiative is financed by various international donors, with Germany, the US and the EU providing combined support of USD 500 million to support Egypt’s actions in the energy sector, along with a variety of other contributions towards initiatives targeted at both energy and other sectors. While Egypt has taken initial steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, these efforts are overshadowed by even larger investments into fossil fuels, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total fossil gas consumption in Africa and is the continent’s second largest gas producer. Domestically, Egypt considers fossil gas as a “bridge fuel” and seeks to increase its consumption in nearly all sectors of the economy. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Egypt has significantly increased fossil gas exports to European countries and aims to position itself as a regional energy hub. These developments risk locking Egypt into a high-carbon pathway. A transition away from all fossil fuels holds multiple benefits and is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. To improve its climate action, Egypt could: Submit an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction target Increase the ambition of its conditional NDC target Cease investing in fossil gas exploration and production Significantly increase the roll-out of renewable energy Despite these challenges, the government has put forward a more ambitious renewable energy target, aiming to achieve 42% of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix by 2030 (five years earlier than originally planned). In 2021, renewable energy generation only amounted to 12% of total power generated."
Egypt,Overall rating,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates Egypt’s climate targets and policies as “Highly insufficient”. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives and lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions. Egypt’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with warming of up to 4°C when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and its business-as-usual trajectory is consistent with warming over 4°C when compared with its fair share contribution. Egypt’s current policies would result in emissions reductions well below its target, but still only in line with 3°C warming."
Egypt,Policies and action  against fair share,Insufficient,"Egypt has taken its first steps toward investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, but these remain much smaller in scale than investments into fossil fuel-based energy sources, in particular fossil gas. Egypt is Africa’s second largest fossil gas producer and it is making significant investments into new oil and gas production and exploration. The CAT rates Egypt’s policies and action as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Egypt’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The full policies and action analysis can be found here ."
Egypt,Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways,Highly insufficient,"The CAT rates Egypt’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient”. Egypt's NDC includes a conditional mitigation target comprised of a quantified emissions reduction below a business-as-usual scenario in three sub-sectors (electricity, transport and oil & gas) as well as a qualitative list of policies and measures in other sectors. The lack of transparency makes the target difficult to assess. The CAT estimates that the target would lead to emissions rising substantially—by around 50% compared to today’s levels and that it will be overachieved with already implemented policies. To receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its conditional NDC target (what the CAT refers to as an ‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’), Egypt would need to commit to reducing its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 compared to today’s level—with international support."
Egypt,BAU Scenario against fair share,Critically insufficient,"Egypt has not included an unconditional target or component in its second NDC update. In the absence of such a target, the CAT takes Egypt’s estimated 2030 emissions under a business-as-usual scenario as its unconditional commitment and rates it “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Egypt’s unconditional contribution as the CAT has defined it is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Egypt’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C."
