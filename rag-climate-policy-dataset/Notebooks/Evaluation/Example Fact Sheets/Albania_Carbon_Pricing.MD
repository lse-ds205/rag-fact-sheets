The current carbon pricing policy in place in Albania is a carbon tax, which is set at 1.5 lek per liter for gasoline and 3 lek per liter for oil (Source 10, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft). Additionally, excise is reimbursed for biofuels used in transport by the customs authority, up to 5% (Source 10, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft). However, it is worth noting that the country's climate financing is highly dependent on the international community, and there is a lack of an effective and sustainable national financing mechanism (Source 6, Albaniaâ€™s National Adaptation Plan First - progress report).

The coverage of the carbon pricing policy in Albania is not explicitly stated in the provided sources. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the policy may cover various sectors, including energy, industry, agriculture, waste, and land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) (Source 2, Figure 38-41). The policy may also address different types of emissions, such as greenhouse gas emissions from energy-related activities, industrial processes, and agriculture (Source 2, Figure 38-41). Additionally, the policy may aim to reduce emissions from specific sources, such as cement production and refrigerant use (Source 2, Figure 38). However, the exact scope and coverage of the carbon pricing policy in Albania remain unclear.

The price level of the carbon pricing policy in Albania is set at 1.5 lek per liter for gasoline and 3 lek per liter for oil, as stated in Law No.9975, dated 28.7.2008 "For national taxes" (Source 9, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft).

The revenue generated from carbon pricing policies in Albania is not explicitly stated to be returned to citizens or invested in clean energy. However, the National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft mentions that the implementation of energy and climate policies can have various impacts on public budgets, including increasing or decreasing public revenue streams (Source 9, Page Unknown). Additionally, the plan notes that the carbon tax is set at 1.5 lek per liter for gasoline and 3 lek per liter for oil, with the revenue generated from these taxes not specified (Source 5, Page Unknown). Furthermore, the Albania's National Adaptation Plan First - progress report highlights the lack of an effective and sustainable national financing mechanism for climate change adaptation, relying mainly on international donor support (Source 2, Page Unknown).

Q5: Are there any exemptions or special treatment for certain industries or sectors under the carbon pricing policy? 

There is no explicit mention of exemptions or special treatment for certain industries or sectors under the carbon pricing policy in the provided sources. However, it can be inferred that policies improving energy efficiency (EE) in the residential sector, as well as policies requiring construction works, such as building refurbishments or infrastructure-related projects, may have a positive impact on household incomes, employment, and public budgets (Source 6, Page Unknown). Additionally, the development of renewable energy power plants is expected to create employment opportunities, particularly during the construction phase (Source 5, Page Unknown). Nevertheless, the lack of a comprehensive national financing mechanism for climate change adaptation and the reliance on international funding may pose challenges for the implementation of carbon pricing policies (Source 8, Page Unknown).

Albania's carbon pricing policy is expected to interact with other climate policies, such as renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency standards, to achieve the country's emission reduction objectives (Source 5, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft). The policy aims to promote a stable business climate that encourages low-carbon investments, in line with the EU's "Low-carbon Economy Roadmap" (Source 9, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft). The transformation of the current Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) scheme into a Contract-for-Difference (CfD) support scheme for renewable energy, as outlined in the Order of Minister no.27 (Source 10, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft), is expected to play a crucial role in this regard. Additionally, policies improving energy efficiency in the residential sector and promoting the use of renewable energies are expected to have positive impacts on household incomes, employment, and public budgets (Source 6, National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft).

Q7: The key challenges for the carbon pricing policy in Albania include the lack of capacities and human resources (Source 1), limited public budgets (Source 3), and budget allocation restrictions (Source 8). However, opportunities exist in the potential for carbon pricing to generate revenue that can be used to support low-carbon development (Source 3) and improve public budgets (Source 6). Additionally, carbon pricing can create green jobs and stimulate economic growth (Source 7). Effective implementation of carbon pricing policies will require addressing the existing capacity and resource gaps, as well as ensuring that the revenue generated is used to support low-carbon development.

Q8: The carbon pricing policy in Albania is designed to be consistent with the country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change (Source 9). The policy is expected to cover at least 50% of the country's GHG emissions and have a price level of at least $10/tCO2e (Assessment Criteria). However, the policy's alignment with the NDC is not explicitly stated in the provided sources, and further information is needed to confirm its consistency with the NDC., ##METADATA
