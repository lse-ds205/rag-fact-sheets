# RAG Climate Fact Sheets 

## Overview 

This repository contains the collective work of three groups from the DS205 course that developed automated RAG-based systems for extracting, analysing, and synthesising climate policy data from different authoritative sources. Each group adopted distinct approaches and tackled unique challenges in processing climate policy documents that together form a comprehensive framework for automating climate policy analysis.

## üåê UNFCCC NDC Analysis (`rag_unfccc`)
- Source: UNFCCC Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
- Focus: Automated monitoring and standardised fact-sheet generation for newly published NDC documents
- Key Innovation: HopRAG architecture for multi-hop reasoning in complex policy documents

## üéØ Climate Action Tracker Analysis (`rag_cat`)
- Source: ClimateActionTracker.org
- Focus: Structured extraction of policy targets with confidence scoring
- Key Innovation: Hybrid NLP pipeline combining NER, dependency parsing, and semantic similarity

## üìä Climate Policy Radar Dataset Analysis (`rag_policy_radar`)
- Source: Climate Policy Radar Database
- Focus: ASCOR methodology implementation for systematic climate legislation assessment
- Key Innovation: Multi-tier LLM strategy with human-in-the-loop validation

## Summarised Workflow

Below is a summary of the solutions by the 3 groups, and a comparison of their particular approaches for each stage of the task. This also serves as a potential system design that integrates the 3 solutions into a unified workflow for automated climate policy analysis.
