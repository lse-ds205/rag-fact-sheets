detect.yaml is scheduled to run every T and T+1

update.yaml however, is dormant by default, conditional on two things:
- (1) detect.yaml detects a change
- (2) there's concensus between group and client that it's okay to push all pdfs/database/models onto 
      Github/some other third-party cloud provider because otherwise,
      this has to be done locally, and there's no way to trigger an update
